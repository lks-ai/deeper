Logical thinking machines did not care about glory or revenge.\n> But Agamemnon certainly did. Fully alert inside his preservation\n> canister, his human brain watched the plans unfold.\n>\n> Ahead of him, the main fleet of robot warships swept into the\n> human-infested system, overwhelming the crews of surprised sentry\n> vessels like an avalanche out of space. Human picket ships opened\n> fire, defenders swept in to meet the oncoming machine force. Five\n> League sentry vessels fired off heavy salvos, but most of their\n> projectiles were too slow to hit the streaking inbound fleet. A\n> handful of robotic vessels were damaged or destroyed by lucky shots,\n> and just as many human ships exploded in flashes of incandescent\n> vapor--- not because they posed a particular threat, but because they\n> were in the way.\n>\n> Only a few distant scouts managed to transmit a warning toward\n> vulnerable Salusa Secundus. Robot battleships vaporized the diffuse\n> inner perimeter of human defenses, without even slowing on their way\n> to their real goal.\n>\n> Shuddering under extreme deceleration, the thinking-machine fleet\n> would arrive not long after the warning signal reached the capital\n> world.\n>\n> The humans would never have time enough to prepare.\n>\n> The robot fleet was ten times the size and power of any force Omnius\n> had ever before sent against the League of Nobles. The humans had\n> grown complacent, having faced no concentrated robotic aggression\n> during the last century of uneasy cold war. But machines could wait a\n> long time, and now Agamemnon and his surviving Titans would finally\n> have their chance.\n>\n> Revealed by a flurry of tiny machine spy probes, the League had\n> recently installed supposedly invincible defenses against\n> gelcircuitry-based thinking machines. The massive robot fleet would\n> wait at a safe distance while Agamemnon and his small vanguard of\n> cymeks pressed forward on a mission, perhaps a suicidal one, to open\n> the door.\n>\n> Agamemnon reveled in the anticipation. Already the hapless biologicals\n> would be sounding alarms, preparing defenses . . . cowering in fear.\n> Through flowing electrafluid that kept his disembodied brain alive, he\n> transmitted an order to his cymek shock troops. \"Let us destroy the\n> heart of the human resistance. *Forward!*\"\n>\n> For a thousand hellish years, Agamemnon and his Titans had been forced\n> to serve the computer evermind, Omnius. Chafing under their bondage,\n> the ambitious but defeated cymeks now turned their frustration against\n> the League of Nobles. One day the once-defeated general hoped to turn\n> against Omnius himself, but thus far had seen no opportunity.\n>\n> The League had erected new scrambler shields around Salusa Secundus.\n> Such fields would destroy the sophisticated gelcircuitry of all AI\n> computers\n>\n> --- but human minds could survive the passage. And though they had\n> mechanical systems and interchangeable robotic bodies, cymeks still\n> had human brains.\n>\n> Thus, they could pass through the defensive shields unscathed.\n>\n> Like a target behind crosshairs, Salusa Secundus filled Agamemnon's\n> field of view. With great attention to detail the general had studied\n> tactical projections, applying the military skills he'd developed over\n> the centuries, along with an intuitive understanding of the art of\n> conquest. His abilities had once allowed a mere twenty rebels to take\n> over an empire . . . until they'd lost it all to Omnius.\n>\n> Prior to launching this important attack, the computer evermind had\n> insisted on running simulation after simulation, trying to develop\n> plans for every contingency. Agamemnon, though, knew it was futile to\n> plan too precisely when it came to unruly humans.\n>\n> Now, while the immense robot war fleet engaged the expected League\n> orbital defenses and perimeter ships, Agamemnon's mind probed outward\n> from his sensor-connected container, and he felt his guideship as an\n> extension of his long-lost human body. The integral weapons were part\n> of himself. He saw with a thousand eyes, and the powerful engines made\n> him feel as if he had muscular legs again and could run like the wind.\n>\n> \"Prepare for ground assault. Once our dropcarriages penetrate the\n> Salusan defenses, we must strike fast and hard.\" Recalling that\n> watcheyes would record every moment of the battle for the evermind's\n> later scrutiny once the fleet returned, he added, \"We will sterilize\n> this filthy planet for the glory of Omnius.\" Agamemnon slowed his\n> descent, and the others followed suit. \"Xerxes, take the lead.

The most recent major battle had been nearly a hundred years\n> ago. After all these years, the aggressive machines might be counting\n> on soft human defenses, but Xavier swore they would fail.\n>\n> \"Primero Meach, we've received an urgent warning and a vidstream clip\n> from one of our peripheral scouts,\" he said to his commander. \"But the\n> transmission cut off.\"\n>\n> \"Look at them all!\" squawked Quinto Wilby as he scanned images from\n> the outlying sensor network. The low-ranking officer stood with other\n> soldiers at banks of instrument panels inside a domed building.\n> \"Omnius never sent anything like this before.\"\n>\n> Vannibal Meach, the short but loud-voiced primero of the Salusan\n> Militia, stood in the control center of the planet's defenses, coolly\n> absorbing the flow of information. \"Our last report from the perimeter\n> is hours old due to signal lag. By now they've engaged our pickets,\n> and they'll try to get closer. They'll fail, of course.\" Though this\n> was his first warning of the impending invasion, he reacted as if he\n> had expected the machines to arrive any day.\n>\n> In the control room's illumination, Xavier's dark brown hair glinted\n> with reddish cinnamon highlights. He was a serious young man, prone to\n> honesty and with a tendency to see things in black and white. As a\n> member of the\n>\n> third military ranking tier, Tercero Harkonnen was Meach's backup\n> commander of the local defense outposts. Much admired by his\n> superiors, Xavier had been promoted quickly; equally respected by his\n> soldiers, he was the sort of trusted man they would follow into\n> battle.\n>\n> Despite the sheer size and firepower of the robotic force, he willed\n> himself to calmness, then signaled for reports from the nearest picket\n> ships and put the spaceguard defense fleet on highest alert in close\n> orbit. The warship commanders had already called their crews to\n> battle-ready status as soon as they'd heard the urgent transmission\n> from the now-destroyed scout ships.\n>\n> Around Xavier, automated systems hummed with activity. Listening to\n> the oscillating sirens, the chatter of orders and status reports in\n> the control room, he drew a slow breath, prioritizing tasks. \"We can\n> stop them,\" he said. \"We *will* stop them.\" His voice carried a tone\n> of firm command, as if he were much older than his years and\n> accustomed to battling Omnius every day. In reality, this would be his\n> first engagement with the thinking machines.\n>\n> Years ago, his parents and older brother had been killed in a\n> marrauding cymek attack while en route from an inspection of family\n> holdings on Hagal. The soulless machine forces had always been a\n> threat to the League Worlds, but the humans and Omnius had maintained\n> an uneasy peace for decades.\n>\n> On a wall grid, a map of the Gamma Waiping system showed the orbital\n> locations of Salusa Secundus and six other planets, along with the\n> deployment of sixteen patrol battle groups and the vigilant picket\n> ships that were scattered at random. Cuarto Steff Young hurried to\n> update the tactical projection, plotting her best guess of the\n> location of the approaching robot battle group.\n>\n> \"Contact Segundo Lauderdale, and call in all perimeter warships. Tell\n> them to engage and destroy any enemy they encounter,\" said Primero\n> Meach, then he sighed. \"It'll take half a day at maximum acceleration\n> to retrieve our heavy battle groups from the fringe, but the machines\n> might still be\n>\n> trying to get through by then. Could be a field day for our guys.\"\n> Cuarto Young followed the order with easy efficiency, dispatching a\n> message that would take hours to reach the outskirts of the system.\n>\n> Meach nodded to himself, going through the much-drilled sequence.\n> Always living under the specter of the machines, the Salusan Militia\n> trained regularly for every scenario, as did Armada detachments for\n> every major League system. \"Activate the Holtzman scrambler shields\n> around the planet and issue warnings to all commercial air and space\n> traffic. I want the city's shield transmitter output up to full within\n> ten minutes.\"\n>\n> \"That should be enough to brain-fry any thinking machine\n> gelcircuitry,\" Xavier said with forced confidence. \"We've all seen the\n> tests.\" *This, however, is not just a test*.\n>\n> Once the enemy encountered the defenses the Salusans had installed, he\n> hoped they would calculate their losses to be too heavy, and retreat.\n> Thinking machines didn't like to take risks.\n>\n> He stared at a panel. *But there are so many of them*\n>\n> Then he straightened from his summary screens, full of bad news.\n> \"Primero Meach, if our velocity data for the machine fleet is correct,\n> even at deceleration speed, they are traveling almost as fast as the\n> warning signal we received from our scouts.\"\n>\n> \"Then they could already be here!\" said Quinto Wilby.\n>\n> Now Meach reacted with sharp alarm, triggering a full emergency alert.\n> \"Sound evacuation orders! Open the underground shelters.\"\n>\n> \"Evacuation under way, sir,\" reported Cuarto Young moments later, her\n> fingers working the update panels as she spoke.

They launched explosive\n> shells and incinerated buildings and screaming people.

Twenty-eight of them in all.\n>\n> With a howling roar loud enough to burn his ears, the young tercero\n> saw a column of fire and smoke spinning, tumbling, so fast and bright\n> that it left his retinas smoldering. The dropcarriage smashed into the\n> military compound half a kilometer behind him, vaporizing the control\n> center and the planetary Militia HQ building. The shockwave knocked\n> Xavier to his knees, shattered windows for dozens of blocks.\n>\n> \"Primero!\" Xavier screamed into the comline. \"Primero Meach! Command\n> center! Anybody!\"\n>\n> But he could see from the ruins that he would get no response from the\n> Militia commander or any of his comrades in the complex.\n>\n> Stalking through the streets, the cymeks spewed greenish black smoke,\n> an oily mist that settled into a toxic film covering the ground and\n> structures. Then the first squadron of kindjal bombers came in low.\n> Their initial sweep scattered explosives around the machine warriors,\n> striking both cymeks and buildings.\n>\n> Wearing his clearplaz breathing mask, Xavier panted, unable to believe\n> what he had just seen. He called again for the commander, but received\n> no response. Finally, tactical substations around the city checked in,\n> demanding to know what had happened, asking him to identify himself.\n>\n> \"This is Tercero Xavier Harkonnen,\" he said. Then full understanding\n> hit him. With a supreme effort, he summoned his courage and steadied\n> his voice. \"I am . . . I am currently in command of the Salusan\n> Militia.\"\n>\n> He ran toward the conflagration, into the billowing greasy smoke. All\n> around him civilians fell to their knees retching in the poisonous\n> mist. He glared up at the aerial strikes, wishing he could be in more\n> direct control. \"The cymeks can be destroyed,\" he transmitted to the\n> kindjal pilots. Then he coughed. The mask was not working properly.\n> His chest and throat burned as if he had inhaled acid, but he kept\n> shouting orders.\n>\n> As the attack proceeded, Salusan emergency response aircraft swooped\n> over the battle zone, dumping canisters of fire-suppression powders\n> and foams. At ground level, masked medical squadrons moved in without\n> hesitation.\n>\n> Oblivious to the insignificant human defense efforts, the cymeks\n> marched forward, moving as individuals, not an army--- mechanical mad\n> dogs spreading mayhem. A warrior-form bent back on powerful crablike\n> legs and blasted two rescue ships out of the sky--- then it moved\n> ahead again, eerily graceful.\n>\n> The front line of Salusan bombers dropped explosive shells directly\n> onto one of the first cymeks. Two projectiles struck the armored body,\n> and a third hit a nearby building, causing the structure to collapse,\n> girders and debris tumbling down to bury the invader's mechanical\n> body.\n>\n> But after the flames and smoke cleared, the battered cymek remained\n> functional. The murderous machine shook itself free of the rubble,\n> then launched a counterattack at the kindjals overhead.\n>\n> From his distant vantage, Xavier studied their movements, using a\n> portable tactical grid. He needed to figure out the overarching plan\n> of the thinking machines. The cymeks seemed to have a target in mind.\n>\n> He could not hesitate or waste time bemoaning the fall of his\n> comrades. He could not ask what Primero Meach would have done.\n> Instead, he had to stay\n>\n> clear-headed and make some immediate decisions. If he could only\n> understand the enemies' objective . . .\n>\n> In orbit, the robotic fleet continued to fire upon the Salusan\n> spaceguard, though the AI enemy could not pass through Holtzman\n> fields. They might defeat the spaceguard ships and blockade the League\n> capital world . . . but Primero Meach had already recalled the heavy\n> perimeter battle groups, and soon all that League Armada firepower\n> would pose a serious challenge to the robot warships.\n>\n> On the screen he saw the robot fleet maintaining position . . . as if\n> waiting for some signal from the cymek shock troops. His mind whirled.\n> What were they doing?\n>\n> A trio of gladiator machines launched explosives against the west wing\n> of the Hall of Parliament. The beautifully carved facade sloughed to\n> the street like a late-spring avalanche. Slabs of rubble crumbled,\n> exposing open chambers in the evacuated governmental offices.\n>\n> Coughing in the smoke, trying to see through his smeared faceplate,\n> Xavier looked into the eyes of a white-smocked medic who grabbed him\n> and fitted a new mask over his face. Xavier's lungs burned more now,\n> as if they had been soaked in av-fuel and lit on fire.\n>\n> \"You'll be fine,\" the medic promised in an uncertain tone as he\n> applied a snap-injection pack to Xavier's neck.\n>\n> \"I'd better be.\" The tercero coughed again and saw black spots in\n> front of his eyes. \"I don't have time to be a casualty right now.\"\n>\n> Xavier thought beyond himself and felt a deep worry for Serena. Less\n> than an hour ago, she had been scheduled to speak to the League\n> representatives. He prayed that she had reached safety.\n>\n> Struggling to his feet, he waved the medic away as the injection took\n> effect. He tuned his portable tactical grid and requested a sky-high\n> view, imaged\n>\n> from the fast defense kindjals. He studied the blackened paths of the\n> graceful, titanic cymeks on his screen. *Where are they going?*\n>\n> Mentally, he scanned from the smoldering impact craters and the ruins\n> of the Militia HQ, envisioning the paths made by the mechanical\n> monsters as they pressed forward.\n>\n> Then he understood what he should have seen from the start, and cursed\n> under his breath.\n>\n> Omnius knew the Holtzman scrambler shields would obliterate thinking\n> machine gelcircuitry; thus the main robotic fleet remained just beyond\n> Salusan orbit. If the cymeks took out the shield generators, though,\n> the planet would be wide open to a full-scale invasion.\n>\n> Xavier faced a critical decision, but his choice was predetermined.\n> Whether he liked it or not, he was in command now. By wiping out\n> Primero Meach and the Militia command structure, the cymeks had put\n> him temporarily in charge. And he knew what he had to do.\n>\n> He ordered the Salusan Militia to fall back and direct their utmost\n> efforts to defend the single most vital target, leaving the rest of\n> Zimia exposed as the cymeks blasted and burned everywhere. Even if he\n> had to sacrifice part of this important city, he must stop the machine\n> forces from reaching their target.\n>\n> At all costs.\n>\n> *Is the subject or the observer the greater influence?*\n\n--- ERASMUS,\n\nuncollated laboratory files\n\n> **O**n Corrin, one of the primary Synchronized Worlds, the robot\n> Erasmus walked across the flagstone plaza that fronted his lavish\n> villa. He moved with a well-practiced fluidity that he had learned to\n> imitate after centuries of observing human grace. His flowmetal face\n> was a burnished blank oval, like a mirror entirely devoid of\n> expression until he decided to form the metallic polymer film into a\n> range of mimicked emotions, like ancient theater masks.\n>\n> Through optic threads implanted in his facial membrane, he admired the\n> iridescent fountains around him, which so nicely complemented the\n> villa's stonework, gemstone statuary, intricate tapestries, and\n> laser-etched alabaster columns. All plush and opulent, by his own\n> design. After much study and analysis, he had learned to appreciate\n> standards of classical beauty, and was proud of his evident taste.\n>\n> His pet human slaves bustled about performing household chores---\n> polishing trophies and art objects, dusting furniture, planting\n> flowers, trimming topiary shrubs under the crimson afternoon light of\n> the red-giant sun. Each tremulous slave bowed in respect as Erasmus\n> passed. He recognized but did not bother to identify individuals,\n> though he mentally filed every detail. One never knew when the tiniest\n> scrap of data might help in overall understanding.\n>\n> Erasmus had a skin of organic-plastic composites laced with\n> neurelectronics. He pretended that the sophisticated sensor network\n> allowed him to genuinely feel physical sensations. Under the glowing\n> ember of Corrin's huge sun, he detected light and warmth on his skin,\n> presumably like real flesh. He wore a thick gold robe trimmed in\n> carmine, part of a stylish personal wardrobe that separated him from\n> Omnius's lesser robots.\n>\n> Vanity was another thing Erasmus had learned from studying humans, and\n> he rather enjoyed it.\n>\n> Most robots were not as independent as Erasmus. They were little more\n> than mobile thinking boxes, drone subsets of the evermind. Erasmus\n> obeyed Omnius's commands as well, but he had more freedom to\n> interpret. Over the centuries, he had developed his own identity and\n> semblance of an ego. Omnius considered him something of a curiosity.\n>\n> As the robot continued to walk with perfect grace, he detected a\n> buzzing sound. His optic threads picked up a small flying orb, one of\n> Omnius's many mobile watcheyes. Whenever Erasmus ventured away from\n> the ubiquitous screens found throughout all buildings, the avid\n> watcheyes followed him, recording his every move. The evermind's\n> actions spoke of either a deep-seated curiosity . . . or an oddly\n> humanlike paranoia.\n>\n> Long ago, while tinkering with the original AI computers of the Old\n> Empire, the rebel Barbarossa had added approximations of certain\n> personality traits and goals. Subsequently the machines had\n> self-evolved into a single grand electronic mind that retained a few\n> of the imposed human ambitions and characteristics.\n>\n> As far as Omnius was concerned, biologicals, even bastardized cymeks\n> with human brains and machine parts, could not see the epoch-spanning\n> vistas that the gelcircuitry of a machine mind could encompass. When\n> Omnius scanned the universe of possibilities it was like a vast\n> screen. There were so many ways to win, and he was constantly on the\n> alert for them.\n>\n> Omnius's core programming had been duplicated on all the\n> machine-conquered planets and synchronized through the use of regular\n> updates. Faceless, able to watch and communicate throughout the\n> interstellar network, near-identical copies of Omnius were everywhere,\n> vicariously present in innumerable watcheyes, appliances, and contact\n> screens.\n>\n> Now, apparently, the distributed computer mind had nothing better to\n> do than snoop. \"Where are you going, Erasmus?\" Omnius demanded from a\n> tiny speaker beneath the watcheye. \"Why are you walking so fast?\"\n>\n> \"You could walk, too, if you chose to do so. Why not give yourself\n> legs for a while and wear an artificial body, just to see what it is\n> like?\" Erasmus's metallic polymer mask reshaped itself into a smile.\n> \"We could go for a stroll together.\"\n>\n> The watcheye buzzed along beside Erasmus. Corrin had long seasons,\n> because its orbit was so far around the giant sun. Winters and summers\n> each lasted for thousands of days. The rugged landscape had no\n> indigenous forests or wildernesses, only a handful of ancient orchards\n> and agricultural fields that had gone to seed since the machine\n> takeover, left to propogate untended.\n>\n> Many human slaves went blind from exposure to the pounding solar flux.\n> As a consequence, Erasmus fitted his outdoor workers with custom eye\n> protection. He was a benevolent master, concerned for the well-being\n> of his resources.\n>\n> As he reached the entry gate of his villa, the robot adjusted the new\n> sensory-enhancement module grafted by neurelectronic ports onto his\n> body core and hidden beneath his robe. A unit of his own design, the\n> module allowed Erasmus to simulate the senses of humanity, but with\n> certain unavoidable limitations. He wanted to know more than the\n> module could provide, wanted to *feel* more. In this respect, the\n> cymeks might have an advantage over Erasmus, but he would never know\n> for certain.\n>\n> Cymeks--- especially the original Titans--- were a narrow-minded,\n> brutal bunch, with no appreciation for the more refined senses and\n> sensibilities that Erasmus worked so hard to attain. Brutality had its\n> place, of course, but the sophisticated robot considered it only one\n> of many behaviorial aspects worthy of study, both positive and\n> negative. Still, violence was interesting and often pleasurable to\n> employ. . . .\n>\n> He was intensely curious about what made cognizant biologicals\n> *human*. He was intelligent and self-aware, but he also wanted to\n> understand emotions, human sensibilities, and motivations--- the\n> essential details that machines never managed to reproduce very well.\n>\n> During his centuries-long quest, Erasmus had absorbed human artwork,\n> music, philosophy, and literature. Ultimately, he wanted to discover\n> the sum and substance of humanity, the magic spark that made these\n> creatures, these *creators*, different. What gave them . . . souls?\n>\n> He marched into his banquet hall, and the flying eye buzzed away\n> toward the ceiling, where it could observe everything. On the walls,\n> six Omnius screens glowed milky gray.\n>\n> His villa was modeled after the opulent Greco-Roman estates in which\n> the Twenty Titans had lived before forsaking their human bodies.\n> Erasmus owned similar villas on five planets, including Corrin and\n> Earth. He maintained additional facilities--- holding pens, customized\n> vivisection rooms, medical laboratories, as well as greenhouses, art\n> galleries, sculptures, and fountains. All of which enabled him to\n> study human behavior and physiology.\n>\n> Erasmus sat his robed body at the head of a long table lined with\n> silver goblets and candleholders, but with only one place setting. For\n> him. The antique wooden chair had once belonged to a human nobleman,\n> Nivny O'Mura, a founder of the League of Nobles. Erasmus had studied\n> how the rebellious humans had organized themselves and established\n> strongholds against the early cymek and machine assaults. The\n> resourceful *hrethgir* had ways of adapting and improvising, of\n> confounding their enemies in unexpected ways. *Fascinating*.\n>\n> Abruptly, the evermind's voice echoed from all around, sounding bored.\n> \"When will your experiment be concluded, Erasmus? You come in here day\n> after day, doing the same thing. I expect to see results.\"\n>\n> \"I am intrigued by questions. Why do wealthy humans eat with such\n> ceremony? Why do they consider certain foods and beverages superior to\n> others, when the nutritional value is the same?\" The robot's voice\n> became more erudite. \"The answer, Omnius, has to do with their\n> brutally short lives. They compensate with efficient sensory\n> mechanisms capable of imparting intense feelings. Humans have five\n> basic senses, with countless gradations.\n>\n> The taste of Yondair beer versus Ularda wine, for example. Or the feel\n> of Ecaz burlap compared with parasilk, or the music of Brahms\n> versus---\"\n>\n> \"I suppose that is all very interesting in some esoteric way.\"\n>\n> \"Of course, Omnius. You continue to study me while I study humans.\"\n> Erasmus signaled the slaves who peered nervously through a porthole in\n> the door to the villa's kitchen. A probe snaked out of a module at\n> Erasmus's hip and emerged from underneath his robe, waving delicate\n> neurelectronic sensor threads like expectant cobras.\n>\n> \"By tolerating your investigations, Erasmus, I expect that you will\n> develop a detailed model that can reliably predict human behavior. I\n> must know how to make these creatures *usable*.\"\n>\n> White-clad slaves brought trays of food from the kitchen--- Corrin\n> game hen, Walgis beef almondine, even rare Platinum River salmon\n> harvested from Parmentier. Erasmus dipped the weblike ends of his\n> probe into each dish and \"tasted\" it, sometimes using a cutter to\n> penetrate the meat and sample the internal juices. Erasmus documented\n> each flavor for his growing repertoire.\n>\n> All the while, he carried on a dialogue with Omnius. The evermind\n> seemed to be doling out bits of data and watching how Erasmus reacted.\n> \"I have been building up my military forces. After many years, it is\n> time to move again.\"\n>\n> \"Indeed? Or are the Titans pressuring you into a more aggressive\n> stance? For centuries, Agamemnon has been impatient with what he\n> perceives as your lack of ambition.\" Erasmus was more interested in\n> the bitter berry tart in front of him. Analyzing the ingredients, he\n> was puzzled to detect a strong trace of human saliva and wondered if\n> that had been part of the original recipe. Or had one of the slaves\n> simply expectorated into it?\n>\n> \"I make my own decisions,\" the evermind said. \"It seemed appropriate\n> to launch a new offensive at this time.\"\n>\n> The head chef rolled a cart to the table and used a carving knife to\n> cut a slab of Filet Salusa. The chef, a toady little man who\n> stuttered, placed the dripping slice on a clean plate, added a dollop\n> of savory brown sauce, and extended it toward Erasmus. Clumsily, the\n> chef bumped the knife off the serving tray and it clattered against\n> one of Erasmus's smooth feet, leaving a nick and a stain.\n>\n> Terrified, the man bent to retrieve the knife, but Erasmus flashed a\n> mechanical hand down and grabbed the handle. Sitting straight, the\n> elegant robot continued to talk to Omnius. \"A new offensive? And is it\n> a mere coincidence that the Titan Barbarossa requested exactly that as\n> a reward when he defeated your fighting machine in the gladiator\n> arena?\"\n>\n> \"Irrelevant.\"\n>\n> Staring at the blade, the chef stammered, \"I will p-personally\n> p-polish it and m-m-make it good as n-n-new, Lord Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \"Humans are such fools, Erasmus,\" Omnius said from speakers on the\n> wall.\n>\n> \"Some of them are,\" Erasmus agreed, waving the carving knife with\n> graceful movements. The little chef mouthed a silent prayer, unable to\n> move. \"I wonder what should I do?\" Erasmus wiped the knife clean on\n> the trembling man's smock, then stared at the fellow's distorted\n> reflection in the metal blade.\n>\n> \"Human death is different from machine death,\" Omnius said\n> dispassionately. \"A machine can be duplicated, backed-up. When humans\n> die, they are gone permanently.\"\n>\n> Erasmus simulated a boisterous laugh. \"Omnius, though you always talk\n> about the superiority of machines, you fail to recognize what humans\n> do better than we.\"\n>\n> \"Do not give me another of your lists,\" the evermind said. \"I recall\n> our last debate on this subject with perfect accuracy.\"\n>\n> \"Superiority is in the eye of the beholder and invariably involves\n> filtering out details that do not conform to a particular preconceived\n> notion.\" With his sensory detectors waving like cilia in the air,\n> Erasmus smelled the odor of foul sweat from the chef.\n>\n> \"Are you going to kill this one?\" Omnius asked.\n>\n> Erasmus placed the knife on the table and heard the toady man emit a\n> sigh. \"Individually, humans are easy to kill. But as a species, the\n> challenge is far greater. When threatened, they draw together and\n> become more powerful, more dangerous. Sometimes it is best to surprise\n> them.\"\n>\n> Without warning, he grabbed the knife and plunged it into the chef's\n> chest with enough force to drive it through the sternum and into the\n> heart. \"Like so.\" Blood spurted down the white uniform, onto the table\n> and the robot's plate.\n>\n> The hapless human slid off the blade, gurgling. As Erasmus held the\n> bloody knife he considered attempting to duplicate his victim's look\n> of disbelief and betrayal with his own pliable mask, but decided not\n> to bother. His robot face remained a flat, mirrored oval. Erasmus\n> would never be required to display such an expression anyway.\n>\n> Curious, he tossed the blade aside with a clatter, then dipped\n> sensitive probe threads into the blood on his plate. The taste was\n> quite interesting and complex. He wondered if the blood of various\n> victims would taste any different.\n>\n> Robot guards dragged the chef's body away, while other terrified\n> slaves huddled by the doorway, knowing they should clean up the mess.\n> Erasmus studied their fear.\n>\n> Omnius said, \"Now I wish to tell you something important that I have\n> decided to do. My attack plans are already set in motion.\"\n>\n> Erasmus feigned interest, as he often did. He activated a cleaning\n> mechanism that sterilized the tip of his probe, which then snaked back\n> into\n>\n> its hiding place beneath the robe. \"I defer to your judgment, Omnius.\n> I have no expertise in military matters.\"\n>\n> \"That is exactly why you should heed my words. You always say you want\n> to learn. When Barbarossa defeated my gladiator robot in exhibition\n> combat, he requested the chance to strike against the League Worlds,\n> as a boon from me. The remaining Titans are convinced that without\n> these *hrethgir*, the universe would be infinitely more efficient and\n> tidy.\"\n>\n> \"How medieval,\" Erasmus said. \"The great Omnius would follow the\n> military suggestions of a cymek?\"\n>\n> \"Barbarossa amused me, and there is always the chance that some of the\n> Titans might be killed. That is not necessarily a bad thing.\"\n>\n> \"Of course,\" Erasmus said, \"since programming restrictions prevent you\n> from harming your creators outright.\"\n>\n> \"Accidents happen. Regardless, our offensive will either subsume the\n> League Worlds or exterminate the fragments of humanity there. I do not\n> care which. Very few humans are worth keeping around . . . perhaps\n> none at all.\"\n>\n> Erasmus did not like the sound of that.\n>\n> *The mind commands the body and immediately it obeys.

As he fit his own breather into place, Xavier felt a growing\n> fear that all of the Militia's best-planned precautions would be\n> woefully inadequate.\n>\n> Leaving the discarded shells of their dropcarriages behind, cymek\n> warriors thrummed forward on monstrous feet. They launched explosive\n> shells and incinerated buildings and screaming people. Gouts of flame\n> poured from nozzles in their foremost limbs, setting the city of Zimia\n> on fire.\n>\n> Dropcarriages continued to tumble from above, ready to split open as\n> soon as they crashed. Twenty-eight of them in all.\n>\n> With a howling roar loud enough to burn his ears, the young tercero\n> saw a column of fire and smoke spinning, tumbling, so fast and bright\n> that it left his retinas smoldering. The dropcarriage smashed into the\n> military compound half a kilometer behind him, vaporizing the control\n> center and the planetary Militia HQ building. The shockwave knocked\n> Xavier to his knees, shattered windows for dozens of blocks.\n>\n> \"Primero!\" Xavier screamed into the comline. \"Primero Meach! Command\n> center! Anybody!\"\n>\n> But he could see from the ruins that he would get no response from the\n> Militia commander or any of his comrades in the complex.\n>\n> Stalking through the streets, the cymeks spewed greenish black smoke,\n> an oily mist that settled into a toxic film covering the ground and\n> structures. Then the first squadron of kindjal bombers came in low.\n> Their initial sweep scattered explosives around the machine warriors,\n> striking both cymeks and buildings.\n>\n> Wearing his clearplaz breathing mask, Xavier panted, unable to believe\n> what he had just seen. He called again for the commander, but received\n> no response. Finally, tactical substations around the city checked in,\n> demanding to know what had happened, asking him to identify himself.\n>\n> \"This is Tercero Xavier Harkonnen,\" he said. Then full understanding\n> hit him. With a supreme effort, he summoned his courage and steadied\n> his voice. \"I am . . . I am currently in command of the Salusan\n> Militia.\"\n>\n> He ran toward the conflagration, into the billowing greasy smoke. All\n> around him civilians fell to their knees retching in the poisonous\n> mist. He glared up at the aerial strikes, wishing he could be in more\n> direct control. \"The cymeks can be destroyed,\" he transmitted to the\n> kindjal pilots. Then he coughed. The mask was not working properly.\n> His chest and throat burned as if he had inhaled acid, but he kept\n> shouting orders.\n>\n> As the attack proceeded, Salusan emergency response aircraft swooped\n> over the battle zone, dumping canisters of fire-suppression powders\n> and foams. At ground level, masked medical squadrons moved in without\n> hesitation.\n>\n> Oblivious to the insignificant human defense efforts, the cymeks\n> marched forward, moving as individuals, not an army--- mechanical mad\n> dogs spreading mayhem. A warrior-form bent back on powerful crablike\n> legs and blasted two rescue ships out of the sky--- then it moved\n> ahead again, eerily graceful.\n>\n> The front line of Salusan bombers dropped explosive shells directly\n> onto one of the first cymeks. Two projectiles struck the armored body,\n> and a third hit a nearby building, causing the structure to collapse,\n> girders and debris tumbling down to bury the invader's mechanical\n> body.\n>\n> But after the flames and smoke cleared, the battered cymek remained\n> functional. The murderous machine shook itself free of the rubble,\n> then launched a counterattack at the kindjals overhead.\n>\n> From his distant vantage, Xavier studied their movements, using a\n> portable tactical grid. He needed to figure out the overarching plan\n> of the thinking machines. The cymeks seemed to have a target in mind.\n>\n> He could not hesitate or waste time bemoaning the fall of his\n> comrades. He could not ask what Primero Meach would have done.\n> Instead, he had to stay\n>\n> clear-headed and make some immediate decisions. If he could only\n> understand the enemies' objective . . .\n>\n> In orbit, the robotic fleet continued to fire upon the Salusan\n> spaceguard, though the AI enemy could not pass through Holtzman\n> fields. They might defeat the spaceguard ships and blockade the League\n> capital world . . . but Primero Meach had already recalled the heavy\n> perimeter battle groups, and soon all that League Armada firepower\n> would pose a serious challenge to the robot warships.\n>\n> On the screen he saw the robot fleet maintaining position . . . as if\n> waiting for some signal from the cymek shock troops. His mind whirled.\n> What were they doing?\n>\n> A trio of gladiator machines launched explosives against the west wing\n> of the Hall of Parliament. The beautifully carved facade sloughed to\n> the street like a late-spring avalanche. Slabs of rubble crumbled,\n> exposing open chambers in the evacuated governmental offices.\n>\n> Coughing in the smoke, trying to see through his smeared faceplate,\n> Xavier looked into the eyes of a white-smocked medic who grabbed him\n> and fitted a new mask over his face. Xavier's lungs burned more now,\n> as if they had been soaked in av-fuel and lit on fire.\n>\n> \"You'll be fine,\" the medic promised in an uncertain tone as he\n> applied a snap-injection pack to Xavier's neck.\n>\n> \"I'd better be.\" The tercero coughed again and saw black spots in\n> front of his eyes. \"I don't have time to be a casualty right now.\"\n>\n> Xavier thought beyond himself and felt a deep worry for Serena. Less\n> than an hour ago, she had been scheduled to speak to the League\n> representatives. He prayed that she had reached safety.\n>\n> Struggling to his feet, he waved the medic away as the injection took\n> effect. He tuned his portable tactical grid and requested a sky-high\n> view, imaged\n>\n> from the fast defense kindjals. He studied the blackened paths of the\n> graceful, titanic cymeks on his screen. *Where are they going?*\n>\n> Mentally, he scanned from the smoldering impact craters and the ruins\n> of the Militia HQ, envisioning the paths made by the mechanical\n> monsters as they pressed forward.\n>\n> Then he understood what he should have seen from the start, and cursed\n> under his breath.\n>\n> Omnius knew the Holtzman scrambler shields would obliterate thinking\n> machine gelcircuitry; thus the main robotic fleet remained just beyond\n> Salusan orbit. If the cymeks took out the shield generators, though,\n> the planet would be wide open to a full-scale invasion.\n>\n> Xavier faced a critical decision, but his choice was predetermined.\n> Whether he liked it or not, he was in command now. By wiping out\n> Primero Meach and the Militia command structure, the cymeks had put\n> him temporarily in charge. And he knew what he had to do.\n>\n> He ordered the Salusan Militia to fall back and direct their utmost\n> efforts to defend the single most vital target, leaving the rest of\n> Zimia exposed as the cymeks blasted and burned everywhere. Even if he\n> had to sacrifice part of this important city, he must stop the machine\n> forces from reaching their target.\n>\n> At all costs.\n>\n> *Is the subject or the observer the greater influence?*\n\n--- ERASMUS,\n\nuncollated laboratory files\n\n> **O**n Corrin, one of the primary Synchronized Worlds, the robot\n> Erasmus walked across the flagstone plaza that fronted his lavish\n> villa. He moved with a well-practiced fluidity that he had learned to\n> imitate after centuries of observing human grace. His flowmetal face\n> was a burnished blank oval, like a mirror entirely devoid of\n> expression until he decided to form the metallic polymer film into a\n> range of mimicked emotions, like ancient theater masks.\n>\n> Through optic threads implanted in his facial membrane, he admired the\n> iridescent fountains around him, which so nicely complemented the\n> villa's stonework, gemstone statuary, intricate tapestries, and\n> laser-etched alabaster columns. All plush and opulent, by his own\n> design. After much study and analysis, he had learned to appreciate\n> standards of classical beauty, and was proud of his evident taste.\n>\n> His pet human slaves bustled about performing household chores---\n> polishing trophies and art objects, dusting furniture, planting\n> flowers, trimming topiary shrubs under the crimson afternoon light of\n> the red-giant sun. Each tremulous slave bowed in respect as Erasmus\n> passed. He recognized but did not bother to identify individuals,\n> though he mentally filed every detail. One never knew when the tiniest\n> scrap of data might help in overall understanding.\n>\n> Erasmus had a skin of organic-plastic composites laced with\n> neurelectronics. He pretended that the sophisticated sensor network\n> allowed him to genuinely feel physical sensations. Under the glowing\n> ember of Corrin's huge sun, he detected light and warmth on his skin,\n> presumably like real flesh. He wore a thick gold robe trimmed in\n> carmine, part of a stylish personal wardrobe that separated him from\n> Omnius's lesser robots.\n>\n> Vanity was another thing Erasmus had learned from studying humans, and\n> he rather enjoyed it.\n>\n> Most robots were not as independent as Erasmus. They were little more\n> than mobile thinking boxes, drone subsets of the evermind. Erasmus\n> obeyed Omnius's commands as well, but he had more freedom to\n> interpret. Over the centuries, he had developed his own identity and\n> semblance of an ego. Omnius considered him something of a curiosity.\n>\n> As the robot continued to walk with perfect grace, he detected a\n> buzzing sound. His optic threads picked up a small flying orb, one of\n> Omnius's many mobile watcheyes. Whenever Erasmus ventured away from\n> the ubiquitous screens found throughout all buildings, the avid\n> watcheyes followed him, recording his every move. The evermind's\n> actions spoke of either a deep-seated curiosity . . . or an oddly\n> humanlike paranoia.\n>\n> Long ago, while tinkering with the original AI computers of the Old\n> Empire, the rebel Barbarossa had added approximations of certain\n> personality traits and goals. Subsequently the machines had\n> self-evolved into a single grand electronic mind that retained a few\n> of the imposed human ambitions and characteristics.\n>\n> As far as Omnius was concerned, biologicals, even bastardized cymeks\n> with human brains and machine parts, could not see the epoch-spanning\n> vistas that the gelcircuitry of a machine mind could encompass. When\n> Omnius scanned the universe of possibilities it was like a vast\n> screen. There were so many ways to win, and he was constantly on the\n> alert for them.\n>\n> Omnius's core programming had been duplicated on all the\n> machine-conquered planets and synchronized through the use of regular\n> updates. Faceless, able to watch and communicate throughout the\n> interstellar network, near-identical copies of Omnius were everywhere,\n> vicariously present in innumerable watcheyes, appliances, and contact\n> screens.\n>\n> Now, apparently, the distributed computer mind had nothing better to\n> do than snoop. \"Where are you going, Erasmus?\" Omnius demanded from a\n> tiny speaker beneath the watcheye. \"Why are you walking so fast?\"\n>\n> \"You could walk, too, if you chose to do so. Why not give yourself\n> legs for a while and wear an artificial body, just to see what it is\n> like?\" Erasmus's metallic polymer mask reshaped itself into a smile.\n> \"We could go for a stroll together.\"\n>\n> The watcheye buzzed along beside Erasmus. Corrin had long seasons,\n> because its orbit was so far around the giant sun. Winters and summers\n> each lasted for thousands of days. The rugged landscape had no\n> indigenous forests or wildernesses, only a handful of ancient orchards\n> and agricultural fields that had gone to seed since the machine\n> takeover, left to propogate untended.\n>\n> Many human slaves went blind from exposure to the pounding solar flux.\n> As a consequence, Erasmus fitted his outdoor workers with custom eye\n> protection. He was a benevolent master, concerned for the well-being\n> of his resources.\n>\n> As he reached the entry gate of his villa, the robot adjusted the new\n> sensory-enhancement module grafted by neurelectronic ports onto his\n> body core and hidden beneath his robe. A unit of his own design, the\n> module allowed Erasmus to simulate the senses of humanity, but with\n> certain unavoidable limitations. He wanted to know more than the\n> module could provide, wanted to *feel* more. In this respect, the\n> cymeks might have an advantage over Erasmus, but he would never know\n> for certain.\n>\n> Cymeks--- especially the original Titans--- were a narrow-minded,\n> brutal bunch, with no appreciation for the more refined senses and\n> sensibilities that Erasmus worked so hard to attain. Brutality had its\n> place, of course, but the sophisticated robot considered it only one\n> of many behaviorial aspects worthy of study, both positive and\n> negative. Still, violence was interesting and often pleasurable to\n> employ. . . .\n>\n> He was intensely curious about what made cognizant biologicals\n> *human*. He was intelligent and self-aware, but he also wanted to\n> understand emotions, human sensibilities, and motivations--- the\n> essential details that machines never managed to reproduce very well.\n>\n> During his centuries-long quest, Erasmus had absorbed human artwork,\n> music, philosophy, and literature. Ultimately, he wanted to discover\n> the sum and substance of humanity, the magic spark that made these\n> creatures, these *creators*, different. What gave them . . . souls?\n>\n> He marched into his banquet hall, and the flying eye buzzed away\n> toward the ceiling, where it could observe everything. On the walls,\n> six Omnius screens glowed milky gray.\n>\n> His villa was modeled after the opulent Greco-Roman estates in which\n> the Twenty Titans had lived before forsaking their human bodies.\n> Erasmus owned similar villas on five planets, including Corrin and\n> Earth. He maintained additional facilities--- holding pens, customized\n> vivisection rooms, medical laboratories, as well as greenhouses, art\n> galleries, sculptures, and fountains. All of which enabled him to\n> study human behavior and physiology.\n>\n> Erasmus sat his robed body at the head of a long table lined with\n> silver goblets and candleholders, but with only one place setting. For\n> him. The antique wooden chair had once belonged to a human nobleman,\n> Nivny O'Mura, a founder of the League of Nobles. Erasmus had studied\n> how the rebellious humans had organized themselves and established\n> strongholds against the early cymek and machine assaults. The\n> resourceful *hrethgir* had ways of adapting and improvising, of\n> confounding their enemies in unexpected ways. *Fascinating*.\n>\n> Abruptly, the evermind's voice echoed from all around, sounding bored.\n> \"When will your experiment be concluded, Erasmus? You come in here day\n> after day, doing the same thing. I expect to see results.\"\n>\n> \"I am intrigued by questions. Why do wealthy humans eat with such\n> ceremony? Why do they consider certain foods and beverages superior to\n> others, when the nutritional value is the same?\" The robot's voice\n> became more erudite. \"The answer, Omnius, has to do with their\n> brutally short lives. They compensate with efficient sensory\n> mechanisms capable of imparting intense feelings. Humans have five\n> basic senses, with countless gradations.\n>\n> The taste of Yondair beer versus Ularda wine, for example. Or the feel\n> of Ecaz burlap compared with parasilk, or the music of Brahms\n> versus---\"\n>\n> \"I suppose that is all very interesting in some esoteric way.\"\n>\n> \"Of course, Omnius. You continue to study me while I study humans.\"\n> Erasmus signaled the slaves who peered nervously through a porthole in\n> the door to the villa's kitchen. A probe snaked out of a module at\n> Erasmus's hip and emerged from underneath his robe, waving delicate\n> neurelectronic sensor threads like expectant cobras.\n>\n> \"By tolerating your investigations, Erasmus, I expect that you will\n> develop a detailed model that can reliably predict human behavior. I\n> must know how to make these creatures *usable*.\"\n>\n> White-clad slaves brought trays of food from the kitchen--- Corrin\n> game hen, Walgis beef almondine, even rare Platinum River salmon\n> harvested from Parmentier. Erasmus dipped the weblike ends of his\n> probe into each dish and \"tasted\" it, sometimes using a cutter to\n> penetrate the meat and sample the internal juices. Erasmus documented\n> each flavor for his growing repertoire.\n>\n> All the while, he carried on a dialogue with Omnius. The evermind\n> seemed to be doling out bits of data and watching how Erasmus reacted.\n> \"I have been building up my military forces. After many years, it is\n> time to move again.\"\n>\n> \"Indeed? Or are the Titans pressuring you into a more aggressive\n> stance? For centuries, Agamemnon has been impatient with what he\n> perceives as your lack of ambition.\" Erasmus was more interested in\n> the bitter berry tart in front of him. Analyzing the ingredients, he\n> was puzzled to detect a strong trace of human saliva and wondered if\n> that had been part of the original recipe. Or had one of the slaves\n> simply expectorated into it?\n>\n> \"I make my own decisions,\" the evermind said. \"It seemed appropriate\n> to launch a new offensive at this time.\"\n>\n> The head chef rolled a cart to the table and used a carving knife to\n> cut a slab of Filet Salusa. The chef, a toady little man who\n> stuttered, placed the dripping slice on a clean plate, added a dollop\n> of savory brown sauce, and extended it toward Erasmus. Clumsily, the\n> chef bumped the knife off the serving tray and it clattered against\n> one of Erasmus's smooth feet, leaving a nick and a stain.\n>\n> Terrified, the man bent to retrieve the knife, but Erasmus flashed a\n> mechanical hand down and grabbed the handle. Sitting straight, the\n> elegant robot continued to talk to Omnius. \"A new offensive? And is it\n> a mere coincidence that the Titan Barbarossa requested exactly that as\n> a reward when he defeated your fighting machine in the gladiator\n> arena?\"\n>\n> \"Irrelevant.\"\n>\n> Staring at the blade, the chef stammered, \"I will p-personally\n> p-polish it and m-m-make it good as n-n-new, Lord Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \"Humans are such fools, Erasmus,\" Omnius said from speakers on the\n> wall.\n>\n> \"Some of them are,\" Erasmus agreed, waving the carving knife with\n> graceful movements. The little chef mouthed a silent prayer, unable to\n> move. \"I wonder what should I do?\" Erasmus wiped the knife clean on\n> the trembling man's smock, then stared at the fellow's distorted\n> reflection in the metal blade.\n>\n> \"Human death is different from machine death,\" Omnius said\n> dispassionately. \"A machine can be duplicated, backed-up. When humans\n> die, they are gone permanently.\"\n>\n> Erasmus simulated a boisterous laugh. \"Omnius, though you always talk\n> about the superiority of machines, you fail to recognize what humans\n> do better than we.\"\n>\n> \"Do not give me another of your lists,\" the evermind said. \"I recall\n> our last debate on this subject with perfect accuracy.\"\n>\n> \"Superiority is in the eye of the beholder and invariably involves\n> filtering out details that do not conform to a particular preconceived\n> notion.\" With his sensory detectors waving like cilia in the air,\n> Erasmus smelled the odor of foul sweat from the chef.\n>\n> \"Are you going to kill this one?\" Omnius asked.\n>\n> Erasmus placed the knife on the table and heard the toady man emit a\n> sigh. \"Individually, humans are easy to kill. But as a species, the\n> challenge is far greater. When threatened, they draw together and\n> become more powerful, more dangerous. Sometimes it is best to surprise\n> them.\"\n>\n> Without warning, he grabbed the knife and plunged it into the chef's\n> chest with enough force to drive it through the sternum and into the\n> heart. \"Like so.\" Blood spurted down the white uniform, onto the table\n> and the robot's plate.\n>\n> The hapless human slid off the blade, gurgling. As Erasmus held the\n> bloody knife he considered attempting to duplicate his victim's look\n> of disbelief and betrayal with his own pliable mask, but decided not\n> to bother. His robot face remained a flat, mirrored oval. Erasmus\n> would never be required to display such an expression anyway.\n>\n> Curious, he tossed the blade aside with a clatter, then dipped\n> sensitive probe threads into the blood on his plate. The taste was\n> quite interesting and complex. He wondered if the blood of various\n> victims would taste any different.\n>\n> Robot guards dragged the chef's body away, while other terrified\n> slaves huddled by the doorway, knowing they should clean up the mess.\n> Erasmus studied their fear.\n>\n> Omnius said, \"Now I wish to tell you something important that I have\n> decided to do. My attack plans are already set in motion.\"\n>\n> Erasmus feigned interest, as he often did. He activated a cleaning\n> mechanism that sterilized the tip of his probe, which then snaked back\n> into\n>\n> its hiding place beneath the robe. \"I defer to your judgment, Omnius.\n> I have no expertise in military matters.\"\n>\n> \"That is exactly why you should heed my words. You always say you want\n> to learn. When Barbarossa defeated my gladiator robot in exhibition\n> combat, he requested the chance to strike against the League Worlds,\n> as a boon from me. The remaining Titans are convinced that without\n> these *hrethgir*, the universe would be infinitely more efficient and\n> tidy.\"\n>\n> \"How medieval,\" Erasmus said. \"The great Omnius would follow the\n> military suggestions of a cymek?\"\n>\n> \"Barbarossa amused me, and there is always the chance that some of the\n> Titans might be killed. That is not necessarily a bad thing.\"\n>\n> \"Of course,\" Erasmus said, \"since programming restrictions prevent you\n> from harming your creators outright.\"\n>\n> \"Accidents happen. Regardless, our offensive will either subsume the\n> League Worlds or exterminate the fragments of humanity there. I do not\n> care which. Very few humans are worth keeping around . . . perhaps\n> none at all.\"\n>\n> Erasmus did not like the sound of that.\n>\n> *The mind commands the body and immediately it obeys.

On the advice of her father, she had also spoken to like-minded\n> representatives in private, rallying some support and gaining a few\n> allies ahead of time.\n>\n> Lifting her chin, adjusting her expression to look authoritative\n> rather than eager, Serena positioned herself inside the recording\n> shell that surrounded the podium like a geodesic dome.

Droning sirens wavered in a chillingly familiar\n> tone--- usually heard only during planned drills--- summoning all\n> reserve members of the Salusan Militia.\n>\n> \"Thinking machines have entered the Salusan system,\" a voice said\n> through built-in speakers. Similar announcements would be ringing all\n> across Zimia. \"We have an alert from perimeter scouts and the sentry\n> battle group.\"\n>\n> Standing next to her father, Serena read details as the Viceroy was\n> handed a brief and urgent summary. \"We've never seen a robot war fleet\n> that size!\" he said. \"How long ago did the first scouts sound the\n> warning? How much time do we have?\"\n>\n> \"We are under attack!\" a man shouted. The delegates were on their\n> feet, scattering like stirred ants.\n>\n> \"Prepare to evacuate the Hall of Parliament.\" The Sergeant at Arms\n> became a flurry of movement. \"All armored shelters are open.\n> Representatives, report to your designated areas.\"\n>\n> Viceroy Butler shouted into the chaos, trying to sound confident. \"The\n> Holtzman shields will protect us!\" Serena could read her father's\n> anxiety, though he covered it well.\n>\n> Amid shouts and cries of panic, the League representatives scrambled\n> for the exits. The merciless enemies of humanity had arrived.\n>\n> *Any man who asks for greater authority does not deserve to have it.*\n>\n> --- TERCERO XAVIER HARKONNEN, address to Salusan Militia\n>\n> **\"T**he robot fleet has just engaged our spaceguard,\" Xavier\n> Harkonnen called from his station. \"Heavy fire exchanged.\"\n>\n> \"Primero Meach!\" Cuarto Steff Young shouted from the orbital grid\n> screens. Xavier could smell the salty metallic tang of Young's nervous\n> sweat. \"Sir, a small detachment of machine ships has broken from the\n> main robotic fleet in orbit. Configuration unknown, but they're\n> preparing for an atmospheric descent.\" She pointed to the images,\n> picking out brilliant lights that signified a cluster of inert\n> projectiles.\n>\n> Xavier glanced at the perimeter scanners, real-time intelligence\n> transmitted from the defensive satellites high above Tio Holtzman's\n> gelcircuitry-scrambling fields. On the highest resolution he saw an\n> assault squadron of pyramidal ships roaring headlong into the\n> atmosphere, straight toward the sizzling shields.\n>\n> \"They're in for an unpleasant surprise,\" Young said with a grim smile.\n> \"No thinking machine can survive that ride.\"\n>\n> \"Our biggest worry will be dodging the debris from their crashing\n> ships,\" Primero Meach quipped. \"Maintain surveillance.\"\n>\n> But the dropcarriages slipped past the scrambler shields--- and kept\n> coming.\n>\n> They showed no electronic signatures at all as they penetrated the\n> boundary.\n>\n> \"How are they getting through?\" Quinto Wilby mopped his brow, brushing\n> dishwater-brown hair out of his eyes.\n>\n> \"No computers could.\" In a flash, Xavier understood what was\n> happening. \"They're blind dropcarriages, sir!\"\n>\n> Young looked up from her screens, breathing hard. \"Impact in less than\n> a minute, Primero. Second wave is coming in behind them. I count\n> twenty-eight projectiles.\" She shook her head. \"No computer signatures\n> on any of them.\"\n>\n> Xavier called out, thinking ahead, \"Rico, Powder, work with\n> med-response teams and fire-suppression squads. Everything up to speed\n> and *ready*. Come on people, we've drilled for this a hundred times! I\n> want all vehicles and rescue equipment mobile and in the air, prepared\n> to move before the first ship hits.\"\n>\n> \"Divert defenses to pound the invaders as soon as they crash.\" Primero\n> Meach lowered his voice, swept his flinty gaze across his comrades.\n> \"Tercero Harkonnen, take a portable comstation and get out there--- be\n> my eyes on the scene. My guess is those dropcarriages will hatch into\n> something unpleasant.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> OUTSIDE, THE CITY streets were chaotic under a cloud-dappled sky.\n> Rushing into the confusion, Xavier heard the hot metallic scream of\n> agonized atmosphere as the inert armored projectiles shot downward\n> like bullets from space.\n>\n> An asteroid-rain of pyramidal dropcarriages slammed into the ground,\n> one after another. With deafening thunder, the first four blind\n> vessels punched into buildings, leveling city blocks with the\n> explosive dispersion of kinetic energy. But sophisticated\n> shock-displacement systems protected the deadly cargo inside.\n>\n> Xavier ran down the street, his uniform rumpled, his sweaty hair\n> clinging to his head. He stopped in front of the giant edifice of the\n> Hall of Parliament. Although second in command of Salusa's defenses,\n> here he was in an unsecured position, ready to issue orders at ground\n> zero. Not exactly the way he had been taught in his Armada Academy\n> courses. But Primero Meach was relying on his assessment,\n> recommendations, and ability to act independently.\n>\n> He touched the comline on his chin. \"I'm in position, sir.\"\n>\n> Five more unguided projectiles thumped into the outskirts of the city,\n> leaving smoldering craters. Explosions. Smoke. Fireballs.\n>\n> From the impact points, the inert crashdown pods cracked open to\n> reveal a huge object stirring in each one. Reactivated mechanical\n> units peeled off charred ablation shielding. With dread, Xavier knew\n> what he was about to see, understood how the enemy machines had\n> managed to pass through the scrambler shields. They were not computer\n> minds at all. . . .\n>\n> *Cymeks*.\n>\n> Fearsome mechanical monstrosities emerged from the broken pyramids,\n> driven by surgically detached human brains. Mobility systems\n> restarted; articulated legs and augmented weapons clicked into place.\n>\n> The cymek bodies lurched out of the smoking craters, crablike\n> gladiators half as tall as the damaged buildings. Their alloy legs\n> were as thick as support girders, bristling with flamer cannons,\n> artillery launchers, poison gas jets.\n>\n> Xavier shouted into his comline. \"Cymek warrior-forms, Primero Meach!\n> They figured out how to get through our orbital defenses!\"\n>\n> All across Salusa, from the outskirts of Zimia to the farthest\n> continent, the local planetary militia was dispatched. Low-atmospheric\n> defense craft--- kindjals--- had already launched in defensive\n> overflights, their weaponry magazines loaded with armor-piercing\n> projectile shells.\n>\n> People in the streets fled in terror; others stood frozen, staring.\n> Xavier shouted descriptions of what he was seeing. He heard Vannibal\n> Meach add, \"Cuarto Young, issue orders for all stations to break out\n> the breathing apparatus. See that filter masks are distributed to the\n> populace. Every person not inside an approved shelter must wear a\n> breather.\"\n>\n> Face masks wouldn't protect against cymek flamers or high-energy\n> detonations, but the people could be safe from the thick poison\n> clouds. As he fit his own breather into place, Xavier felt a growing\n> fear that all of the Militia's best-planned precautions would be\n> woefully inadequate.\n>\n> Leaving the discarded shells of their dropcarriages behind, cymek\n> warriors thrummed forward on monstrous feet. They launched explosive\n> shells and incinerated buildings and screaming people. Gouts of flame\n> poured from nozzles in their foremost limbs, setting the city of Zimia\n> on fire.\n>\n> Dropcarriages continued to tumble from above, ready to split open as\n> soon as they crashed. Twenty-eight of them in all.\n>\n> With a howling roar loud enough to burn his ears, the young tercero\n> saw a column of fire and smoke spinning, tumbling, so fast and bright\n> that it left his retinas smoldering. The dropcarriage smashed into the\n> military compound half a kilometer behind him, vaporizing the control\n> center and the planetary Militia HQ building. The shockwave knocked\n> Xavier to his knees, shattered windows for dozens of blocks.\n>\n> \"Primero!\" Xavier screamed into the comline. \"Primero Meach! Command\n> center! Anybody!\"\n>\n> But he could see from the ruins that he would get no response from the\n> Militia commander or any of his comrades in the complex.\n>\n> Stalking through the streets, the cymeks spewed greenish black smoke,\n> an oily mist that settled into a toxic film covering the ground and\n> structures. Then the first squadron of kindjal bombers came in low.\n> Their initial sweep scattered explosives around the machine warriors,\n> striking both cymeks and buildings.\n>\n> Wearing his clearplaz breathing mask, Xavier panted, unable to believe\n> what he had just seen. He called again for the commander, but received\n> no response. Finally, tactical substations around the city checked in,\n> demanding to know what had happened, asking him to identify himself.\n>\n> \"This is Tercero Xavier Harkonnen,\" he said. Then full understanding\n> hit him. With a supreme effort, he summoned his courage and steadied\n> his voice. \"I am . . . I am currently in command of the Salusan\n> Militia.\"\n>\n> He ran toward the conflagration, into the billowing greasy smoke. All\n> around him civilians fell to their knees retching in the poisonous\n> mist. He glared up at the aerial strikes, wishing he could be in more\n> direct control. \"The cymeks can be destroyed,\" he transmitted to the\n> kindjal pilots. Then he coughed. The mask was not working properly.\n> His chest and throat burned as if he had inhaled acid, but he kept\n> shouting orders.\n>\n> As the attack proceeded, Salusan emergency response aircraft swooped\n> over the battle zone, dumping canisters of fire-suppression powders\n> and foams. At ground level, masked medical squadrons moved in without\n> hesitation.\n>\n> Oblivious to the insignificant human defense efforts, the cymeks\n> marched forward, moving as individuals, not an army--- mechanical mad\n> dogs spreading mayhem. A warrior-form bent back on powerful crablike\n> legs and blasted two rescue ships out of the sky--- then it moved\n> ahead again, eerily graceful.\n>\n> The front line of Salusan bombers dropped explosive shells directly\n> onto one of the first cymeks. Two projectiles struck the armored body,\n> and a third hit a nearby building, causing the structure to collapse,\n> girders and debris tumbling down to bury the invader's mechanical\n> body.\n>\n> But after the flames and smoke cleared, the battered cymek remained\n> functional. The murderous machine shook itself free of the rubble,\n> then launched a counterattack at the kindjals overhead.\n>\n> From his distant vantage, Xavier studied their movements, using a\n> portable tactical grid. He needed to figure out the overarching plan\n> of the thinking machines. The cymeks seemed to have a target in mind.\n>\n> He could not hesitate or waste time bemoaning the fall of his\n> comrades. He could not ask what Primero Meach would have done.\n> Instead, he had to stay\n>\n> clear-headed and make some immediate decisions. If he could only\n> understand the enemies' objective . . .\n>\n> In orbit, the robotic fleet continued to fire upon the Salusan\n> spaceguard, though the AI enemy could not pass through Holtzman\n> fields. They might defeat the spaceguard ships and blockade the League\n> capital world . . . but Primero Meach had already recalled the heavy\n> perimeter battle groups, and soon all that League Armada firepower\n> would pose a serious challenge to the robot warships.\n>\n> On the screen he saw the robot fleet maintaining position . . . as if\n> waiting for some signal from the cymek shock troops. His mind whirled.\n> What were they doing?\n>\n> A trio of gladiator machines launched explosives against the west wing\n> of the Hall of Parliament. The beautifully carved facade sloughed to\n> the street like a late-spring avalanche. Slabs of rubble crumbled,\n> exposing open chambers in the evacuated governmental offices.\n>\n> Coughing in the smoke, trying to see through his smeared faceplate,\n> Xavier looked into the eyes of a white-smocked medic who grabbed him\n> and fitted a new mask over his face. Xavier's lungs burned more now,\n> as if they had been soaked in av-fuel and lit on fire.\n>\n> \"You'll be fine,\" the medic promised in an uncertain tone as he\n> applied a snap-injection pack to Xavier's neck.\n>\n> \"I'd better be.\" The tercero coughed again and saw black spots in\n> front of his eyes. \"I don't have time to be a casualty right now.\"\n>\n> Xavier thought beyond himself and felt a deep worry for Serena. Less\n> than an hour ago, she had been scheduled to speak to the League\n> representatives. He prayed that she had reached safety.\n>\n> Struggling to his feet, he waved the medic away as the injection took\n> effect. He tuned his portable tactical grid and requested a sky-high\n> view, imaged\n>\n> from the fast defense kindjals. He studied the blackened paths of the\n> graceful, titanic cymeks on his screen. *Where are they going?*\n>\n> Mentally, he scanned from the smoldering impact craters and the ruins\n> of the Militia HQ, envisioning the paths made by the mechanical\n> monsters as they pressed forward.\n>\n> Then he understood what he should have seen from the start, and cursed\n> under his breath.\n>\n> Omnius knew the Holtzman scrambler shields would obliterate thinking\n> machine gelcircuitry; thus the main robotic fleet remained just beyond\n> Salusan orbit. If the cymeks took out the shield generators, though,\n> the planet would be wide open to a full-scale invasion.\n>\n> Xavier faced a critical decision, but his choice was predetermined.\n> Whether he liked it or not, he was in command now. By wiping out\n> Primero Meach and the Militia command structure, the cymeks had put\n> him temporarily in charge. And he knew what he had to do.\n>\n> He ordered the Salusan Militia to fall back and direct their utmost\n> efforts to defend the single most vital target, leaving the rest of\n> Zimia exposed as the cymeks blasted and burned everywhere. Even if he\n> had to sacrifice part of this important city, he must stop the machine\n> forces from reaching their target.\n>\n> At all costs.\n>\n> *Is the subject or the observer the greater influence?*\n\n--- ERASMUS,\n\nuncollated laboratory files\n\n> **O**n Corrin, one of the primary Synchronized Worlds, the robot\n> Erasmus walked across the flagstone plaza that fronted his lavish\n> villa. He moved with a well-practiced fluidity that he had learned to\n> imitate after centuries of observing human grace. His flowmetal face\n> was a burnished blank oval, like a mirror entirely devoid of\n> expression until he decided to form the metallic polymer film into a\n> range of mimicked emotions, like ancient theater masks.\n>\n> Through optic threads implanted in his facial membrane, he admired the\n> iridescent fountains around him, which so nicely complemented the\n> villa's stonework, gemstone statuary, intricate tapestries, and\n> laser-etched alabaster columns. All plush and opulent, by his own\n> design. After much study and analysis, he had learned to appreciate\n> standards of classical beauty, and was proud of his evident taste.\n>\n> His pet human slaves bustled about performing household chores---\n> polishing trophies and art objects, dusting furniture, planting\n> flowers, trimming topiary shrubs under the crimson afternoon light of\n> the red-giant sun. Each tremulous slave bowed in respect as Erasmus\n> passed. He recognized but did not bother to identify individuals,\n> though he mentally filed every detail. One never knew when the tiniest\n> scrap of data might help in overall understanding.\n>\n> Erasmus had a skin of organic-plastic composites laced with\n> neurelectronics. He pretended that the sophisticated sensor network\n> allowed him to genuinely feel physical sensations. Under the glowing\n> ember of Corrin's huge sun, he detected light and warmth on his skin,\n> presumably like real flesh. He wore a thick gold robe trimmed in\n> carmine, part of a stylish personal wardrobe that separated him from\n> Omnius's lesser robots.\n>\n> Vanity was another thing Erasmus had learned from studying humans, and\n> he rather enjoyed it.\n>\n> Most robots were not as independent as Erasmus. They were little more\n> than mobile thinking boxes, drone subsets of the evermind. Erasmus\n> obeyed Omnius's commands as well, but he had more freedom to\n> interpret. Over the centuries, he had developed his own identity and\n> semblance of an ego. Omnius considered him something of a curiosity.\n>\n> As the robot continued to walk with perfect grace, he detected a\n> buzzing sound. His optic threads picked up a small flying orb, one of\n> Omnius's many mobile watcheyes. Whenever Erasmus ventured away from\n> the ubiquitous screens found throughout all buildings, the avid\n> watcheyes followed him, recording his every move. The evermind's\n> actions spoke of either a deep-seated curiosity . . . or an oddly\n> humanlike paranoia.\n>\n> Long ago, while tinkering with the original AI computers of the Old\n> Empire, the rebel Barbarossa had added approximations of certain\n> personality traits and goals. Subsequently the machines had\n> self-evolved into a single grand electronic mind that retained a few\n> of the imposed human ambitions and characteristics.\n>\n> As far as Omnius was concerned, biologicals, even bastardized cymeks\n> with human brains and machine parts, could not see the epoch-spanning\n> vistas that the gelcircuitry of a machine mind could encompass. When\n> Omnius scanned the universe of possibilities it was like a vast\n> screen. There were so many ways to win, and he was constantly on the\n> alert for them.\n>\n> Omnius's core programming had been duplicated on all the\n> machine-conquered planets and synchronized through the use of regular\n> updates. Faceless, able to watch and communicate throughout the\n> interstellar network, near-identical copies of Omnius were everywhere,\n> vicariously present in innumerable watcheyes, appliances, and contact\n> screens.\n>\n> Now, apparently, the distributed computer mind had nothing better to\n> do than snoop. \"Where are you going, Erasmus?\" Omnius demanded from a\n> tiny speaker beneath the watcheye. \"Why are you walking so fast?\"\n>\n> \"You could walk, too, if you chose to do so. Why not give yourself\n> legs for a while and wear an artificial body, just to see what it is\n> like?\" Erasmus's metallic polymer mask reshaped itself into a smile.\n> \"We could go for a stroll together.\"\n>\n> The watcheye buzzed along beside Erasmus. Corrin had long seasons,\n> because its orbit was so far around the giant sun. Winters and summers\n> each lasted for thousands of days. The rugged landscape had no\n> indigenous forests or wildernesses, only a handful of ancient orchards\n> and agricultural fields that had gone to seed since the machine\n> takeover, left to propogate untended.\n>\n> Many human slaves went blind from exposure to the pounding solar flux.\n> As a consequence, Erasmus fitted his outdoor workers with custom eye\n> protection. He was a benevolent master, concerned for the well-being\n> of his resources.\n>\n> As he reached the entry gate of his villa, the robot adjusted the new\n> sensory-enhancement module grafted by neurelectronic ports onto his\n> body core and hidden beneath his robe. A unit of his own design, the\n> module allowed Erasmus to simulate the senses of humanity, but with\n> certain unavoidable limitations. He wanted to know more than the\n> module could provide, wanted to *feel* more. In this respect, the\n> cymeks might have an advantage over Erasmus, but he would never know\n> for certain.\n>\n> Cymeks--- especially the original Titans--- were a narrow-minded,\n> brutal bunch, with no appreciation for the more refined senses and\n> sensibilities that Erasmus worked so hard to attain. Brutality had its\n> place, of course, but the sophisticated robot considered it only one\n> of many behaviorial aspects worthy of study, both positive and\n> negative. Still, violence was interesting and often pleasurable to\n> employ. . . .\n>\n> He was intensely curious about what made cognizant biologicals\n> *human*. He was intelligent and self-aware, but he also wanted to\n> understand emotions, human sensibilities, and motivations--- the\n> essential details that machines never managed to reproduce very well.\n>\n> During his centuries-long quest, Erasmus had absorbed human artwork,\n> music, philosophy, and literature. Ultimately, he wanted to discover\n> the sum and substance of humanity, the magic spark that made these\n> creatures, these *creators*, different. What gave them . . . souls?\n>\n> He marched into his banquet hall, and the flying eye buzzed away\n> toward the ceiling, where it could observe everything. On the walls,\n> six Omnius screens glowed milky gray.\n>\n> His villa was modeled after the opulent Greco-Roman estates in which\n> the Twenty Titans had lived before forsaking their human bodies.\n> Erasmus owned similar villas on five planets, including Corrin and\n> Earth. He maintained additional facilities--- holding pens, customized\n> vivisection rooms, medical laboratories, as well as greenhouses, art\n> galleries, sculptures, and fountains. All of which enabled him to\n> study human behavior and physiology.\n>\n> Erasmus sat his robed body at the head of a long table lined with\n> silver goblets and candleholders, but with only one place setting. For\n> him. The antique wooden chair had once belonged to a human nobleman,\n> Nivny O'Mura, a founder of the League of Nobles. Erasmus had studied\n> how the rebellious humans had organized themselves and established\n> strongholds against the early cymek and machine assaults. The\n> resourceful *hrethgir* had ways of adapting and improvising, of\n> confounding their enemies in unexpected ways. *Fascinating*.\n>\n> Abruptly, the evermind's voice echoed from all around, sounding bored.\n> \"When will your experiment be concluded, Erasmus? You come in here day\n> after day, doing the same thing. I expect to see results.\"\n>\n> \"I am intrigued by questions. Why do wealthy humans eat with such\n> ceremony? Why do they consider certain foods and beverages superior to\n> others, when the nutritional value is the same?\" The robot's voice\n> became more erudite. \"The answer, Omnius, has to do with their\n> brutally short lives. They compensate with efficient sensory\n> mechanisms capable of imparting intense feelings. Humans have five\n> basic senses, with countless gradations.\n>\n> The taste of Yondair beer versus Ularda wine, for example. Or the feel\n> of Ecaz burlap compared with parasilk, or the music of Brahms\n> versus---\"\n>\n> \"I suppose that is all very interesting in some esoteric way.\"\n>\n> \"Of course, Omnius. You continue to study me while I study humans.\"\n> Erasmus signaled the slaves who peered nervously through a porthole in\n> the door to the villa's kitchen. A probe snaked out of a module at\n> Erasmus's hip and emerged from underneath his robe, waving delicate\n> neurelectronic sensor threads like expectant cobras.\n>\n> \"By tolerating your investigations, Erasmus, I expect that you will\n> develop a detailed model that can reliably predict human behavior. I\n> must know how to make these creatures *usable*.\"\n>\n> White-clad slaves brought trays of food from the kitchen--- Corrin\n> game hen, Walgis beef almondine, even rare Platinum River salmon\n> harvested from Parmentier. Erasmus dipped the weblike ends of his\n> probe into each dish and \"tasted\" it, sometimes using a cutter to\n> penetrate the meat and sample the internal juices. Erasmus documented\n> each flavor for his growing repertoire.\n>\n> All the while, he carried on a dialogue with Omnius. The evermind\n> seemed to be doling out bits of data and watching how Erasmus reacted.\n> \"I have been building up my military forces. After many years, it is\n> time to move again.\"\n>\n> \"Indeed? Or are the Titans pressuring you into a more aggressive\n> stance? For centuries, Agamemnon has been impatient with what he\n> perceives as your lack of ambition.\" Erasmus was more interested in\n> the bitter berry tart in front of him. Analyzing the ingredients, he\n> was puzzled to detect a strong trace of human saliva and wondered if\n> that had been part of the original recipe. Or had one of the slaves\n> simply expectorated into it?\n>\n> \"I make my own decisions,\" the evermind said. \"It seemed appropriate\n> to launch a new offensive at this time.\"\n>\n> The head chef rolled a cart to the table and used a carving knife to\n> cut a slab of Filet Salusa. The chef, a toady little man who\n> stuttered, placed the dripping slice on a clean plate, added a dollop\n> of savory brown sauce, and extended it toward Erasmus. Clumsily, the\n> chef bumped the knife off the serving tray and it clattered against\n> one of Erasmus's smooth feet, leaving a nick and a stain.\n>\n> Terrified, the man bent to retrieve the knife, but Erasmus flashed a\n> mechanical hand down and grabbed the handle. Sitting straight, the\n> elegant robot continued to talk to Omnius. \"A new offensive? And is it\n> a mere coincidence that the Titan Barbarossa requested exactly that as\n> a reward when he defeated your fighting machine in the gladiator\n> arena?\"\n>\n> \"Irrelevant.\"\n>\n> Staring at the blade, the chef stammered, \"I will p-personally\n> p-polish it and m-m-make it good as n-n-new, Lord Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \"Humans are such fools, Erasmus,\" Omnius said from speakers on the\n> wall.\n>\n> \"Some of them are,\" Erasmus agreed, waving the carving knife with\n> graceful movements. The little chef mouthed a silent prayer, unable to\n> move. \"I wonder what should I do?\" Erasmus wiped the knife clean on\n> the trembling man's smock, then stared at the fellow's distorted\n> reflection in the metal blade.\n>\n> \"Human death is different from machine death,\" Omnius said\n> dispassionately. \"A machine can be duplicated, backed-up. When humans\n> die, they are gone permanently.\"\n>\n> Erasmus simulated a boisterous laugh. \"Omnius, though you always talk\n> about the superiority of machines, you fail to recognize what humans\n> do better than we.\"\n>\n> \"Do not give me another of your lists,\" the evermind said. \"I recall\n> our last debate on this subject with perfect accuracy.\"\n>\n> \"Superiority is in the eye of the beholder and invariably involves\n> filtering out details that do not conform to a particular preconceived\n> notion.\" With his sensory detectors waving like cilia in the air,\n> Erasmus smelled the odor of foul sweat from the chef.\n>\n> \"Are you going to kill this one?\" Omnius asked.\n>\n> Erasmus placed the knife on the table and heard the toady man emit a\n> sigh. \"Individually, humans are easy to kill. But as a species, the\n> challenge is far greater. When threatened, they draw together and\n> become more powerful, more dangerous. Sometimes it is best to surprise\n> them.\"\n>\n> Without warning, he grabbed the knife and plunged it into the chef's\n> chest with enough force to drive it through the sternum and into the\n> heart. \"Like so.\" Blood spurted down the white uniform, onto the table\n> and the robot's plate.\n>\n> The hapless human slid off the blade, gurgling. As Erasmus held the\n> bloody knife he considered attempting to duplicate his victim's look\n> of disbelief and betrayal with his own pliable mask, but decided not\n> to bother. His robot face remained a flat, mirrored oval. Erasmus\n> would never be required to display such an expression anyway.\n>\n> Curious, he tossed the blade aside with a clatter, then dipped\n> sensitive probe threads into the blood on his plate. The taste was\n> quite interesting and complex. He wondered if the blood of various\n> victims would taste any different.\n>\n> Robot guards dragged the chef's body away, while other terrified\n> slaves huddled by the doorway, knowing they should clean up the mess.\n> Erasmus studied their fear.\n>\n> Omnius said, \"Now I wish to tell you something important that I have\n> decided to do. My attack plans are already set in motion.\"\n>\n> Erasmus feigned interest, as he often did. He activated a cleaning\n> mechanism that sterilized the tip of his probe, which then snaked back\n> into\n>\n> its hiding place beneath the robe. \"I defer to your judgment, Omnius.\n> I have no expertise in military matters.\"\n>\n> \"That is exactly why you should heed my words. You always say you want\n> to learn. When Barbarossa defeated my gladiator robot in exhibition\n> combat, he requested the chance to strike against the League Worlds,\n> as a boon from me. The remaining Titans are convinced that without\n> these *hrethgir*, the universe would be infinitely more efficient and\n> tidy.\"\n>\n> \"How medieval,\" Erasmus said. \"The great Omnius would follow the\n> military suggestions of a cymek?\"\n>\n> \"Barbarossa amused me, and there is always the chance that some of the\n> Titans might be killed. That is not necessarily a bad thing.\"\n>\n> \"Of course,\" Erasmus said, \"since programming restrictions prevent you\n> from harming your creators outright.\"\n>\n> \"Accidents happen. Regardless, our offensive will either subsume the\n> League Worlds or exterminate the fragments of humanity there. I do not\n> care which. Very few humans are worth keeping around . . . perhaps\n> none at all.\"\n>\n> Erasmus did not like the sound of that.\n>\n> *The mind commands the body and immediately it obeys.

The rest of the\n> city lay as vulnerable as a lamb prepared for slaughter.

Any target\n> suited them.\n>\n> \"Stand firm,\" Xavier commanded on all channels, overruling howls of\n> outrage from the troops. \"The cymeks are trying to lure us away.\"\n>\n> The warrior-forms set fire to a resonant bell tower erected by Chusuk\n> to commemorate a successful defense against the thinking machines,\n> four centuries ago. The ornate bells clanged and gonged as the tower\n> collapsed onto the paving stones of an open gathering square.\n>\n> By now most of Zimia's populace had rushed to armored shelters. Fleets\n> of medical and fire-suppression craft dodged enemy blasts to fight the\n> increasing disaster. Many rescue attempts became suicide missions.\n>\n> In the midst of the Militia crowded around the transmitting towers,\n> Xavier felt a flash of doubt, wondering if he had made the right\n> decision but not daring to change his mind now. His eyes stung from\n> smoke, and his shredded lungs sent shocks of agony through his body\n> each time he drew a breath. He knew he was right. He was fighting for\n> the lives of everyone on the planet. Including Serena Butler's.\n>\n> \"Now what, Tercero?\" said Cuarto Jaymes Powder, coming up behind him.\n> Though the subcommander's angular face was partially covered in a\n> mask, his eyes still revealed his outrage. \"Do we just sit back and\n> watch these bastards level Zimia? What good is it to protect the\n> shield transmitters if there's nothing left of the city?\"\n>\n> \"We can't save the city if we lose our shields and open up the whole\n> planet to machine attack,\" Xavier rasped.\n>\n> The Salusan troops mounted a defense around the parabolic lattice-work\n> of transmitting towers. Ground forces and armored equipment were\n> arrayed on the surrounding ramparts and streets. Kindjals circled the\n> skies and fired their weapons, keeping the cymeks away.\n>\n> Gripping their weapons, the nearest Militia members seethed. The\n> frustrated men wanted to rush forward and engage the attackers . . .\n> or perhaps tear Xavier limb from limb. With each explosion or leveled\n> building, the angry troops edged one step closer to outright mutiny.\n>\n> \"Until reinforcements arrive, we'll need to concentrate our forces,\"\n> Xavier said, coughing.\n>\n> Powder stared at the tercero's plaz faceplate, noticed blood on the\n> inside. \"Sir, are you all right?\"\n>\n> \"It's nothing.\" But Xavier heard the liquid wheezing of his mangled\n> lungs with every breath he took.\n>\n> Feeling unsteady as the poison continued to burn his soft tissues, he\n> gripped a plascrete bulwark for support. He studied the last stand he\n> had assembled on short notice and hoped it would hold. Finally, Xavier\n> said, \"Now that these towers are held and protected, we can go out and\n> hunt down some of our attackers. Are you ready, Cuarto Powder?\"\n>\n> Powder brightened, and soldiers cheered. Several men fired their\n> weapons into the air, ready to charge pell-mell into the destruction.\n> Like a rider at the reins of a willful horse, Xavier held them back.\n>\n> \"Wait! Pay close attention. There is no clever trick we can use, no\n> inherent weakness that will allow us to outsmart the cymeks. But we\n> have the will to succeed and the need to succeed . . . or we will lose\n> everything.\" Ignoring the blood in his mask, he didn't know how he was\n> able to summon unwavering confidence in his voice. \"*This* is how we\n> will beat them.\"\n>\n> During the initial frantic skirmishes, Xavier had seen at least one of\n> the gargantuan invaders destroyed by multiple, concentrated\n> explosions. Its articulated body was now nothing more than a smoking\n> hulk. However, the scattered bombers and armored ground units had\n> spread their attacks across too many targets, diluting their efforts.\n>\n> \"This will be a coordinated strike. We will select a single target and\n> crush it, one cymek at a time. We'll hit it and hit it again until\n> there's nothing left. Then we'll go on to the next one.\"\n>\n> Though he could barely breathe, Xavier chose to lead the squadrons\n> himself. As a tercero, he was accustomed to being in the thick of the\n> action during training exercises and simulations.\n>\n> \"Sir?\" Powder said, surprised. \"Shouldn't you be in a secure area? As\n> the acting commander, standard procedure requires---\"\n>\n> \"You're absolutely right, Jaymes,\" he said quietly. \"Nevertheless, I'm\n> going up there. We're in an all-or-nothing situation. You stay here\n> and protect those towers at all costs.\"\n>\n> Subterranean elevators brought more kindjals to the surface, ready for\n> launch. He climbed into one of the mottled gray craft and sealed\n> himself into the cockpit. Troopers raced to their assault ships,\n> shouting promises of revenge to their comrades who were forced to\n> remain behind. As he transferred the kindjal's comchannel to his\n> command frequency, Xavier issued new instructions.\n>\n> Tercero Harkonnen adjusted the cockpit seat and launched his kindjal.\n> The rush of acceleration pushed him backward and made his breathing\n> even more difficult. Hot blood trickled from one corner of his mouth.\n>\n> Soaring away from the central transmitting towers, aircraft followed\n> him, while a small number of armored ground vehicles moved away from\n> the generating facility, heading for their designated intercept\n> positions. Weapons primed and bombs ready to drop, the kindjals\n> descended toward the first cymek target, one of the smaller machines.\n> Xavier's voice crackled in the cockpit of every aircraft. \"On my mark,\n> strike---*now*.\"\n>\n> The defenders pounded the crablike body from all directions until the\n> warrior-form lay crushed, its articulated legs blackened and twisted,\n> the brain canister destroyed. Cheers and catcalls resonated across the\n>\n> comchannels. Before the cymeks could react to the new coordinated\n> tactic, Xavier chose a second target. \"Follow me. Next one.\"\n>\n> The Militia squadron came in like a hammer, converging on a single\n> mechanical body. Mobile armored ground units opened fire from the\n> surface, while kindjals dropped powerful bombs from above.\n>\n> The second cymek target saw the attack coming and raised its spiked\n> metal legs to open fire with white-hot sprays of flame. Two of\n> Xavier's flanking kindjals went down, crashing into already-ruined\n> buildings. Stray bombs leveled a square block of the city.\n>\n> But the remainder of the concentrated assault struck true. The\n> multiple explosions were more than the robotic body could withstand,\n> and another cymek was battered into wreckage. One of its metal arms\n> twitched, then fell out of its socket into the rubble.\n>\n> \"Three down,\" Xavier said. \"Twenty-five more.\" \"Unless they retreat\n> first,\" said another pilot.\n>\n> The cymeks were individuals, unlike most of Omnius's thinking\n> machines. Some of them were survivors of the original Titans;\n> others--- the neo-cymeks--- came from traitorous human collaborators\n> on the Synchronized Worlds. All had sacrificed their physical bodies\n> so they could be closer to the supposed perfection of thinking\n> machines.\n>\n> Among the troops surrounding the field-transmission towers, Cuarto\n> Powder used everything in his combined arsenals to drive back four\n> cymeks that had gotten close enough to threaten the vital structures.\n> He destroyed one warrior-form and forced the other three to limp away\n> and regroup. Meanwhile, Xavier's forces in the air crushed two more\n> cymeks.\n>\n> The tide was turning.\n>\n> Xavier's bomb-laden kindjals came around again, closing on a new wave\n> of invaders. Followed by armored ground vehicles and artillery guns,\n> the\n>\n> Salusan Militia launched volley after volley at the foremost cymek.\n> The bombardment damaged the machine's legs, obliterated its weapons.\n> Kindjals circled around to deliver the final blow.\n>\n> Surprisingly, the central turret containing the cymek's human brain\n> detached itself. With a bright flash of ignition, locking bolts\n> blasted clear of the set of articulated legs. The armored spherical\n> container rocketed skyward, beyond the reach of Salusan weapons.\n>\n> \"An escape pod to protect the traitor's brain.\" Xavier's words caused\n> him to wheeze and cough more blood. \"Open fire on it!\" His kindjals\n> launched their weapons as the cymek pod soared into the smoky sky with\n> enough thrust to reach escape velocity.\n>\n> \"Damn!\" The pilots shot at the fading exhaust trail, but the cymek's\n> escape pod rapidly dwindled from sight.\n>\n> \"Don't waste your weapons,\" Xavier said over the comline. \"That one's\n> no longer a threat.\" He felt dizzy, either fading into unconsciousness\n> . . . or dying.\n>\n> \"Yes, sir.\" The kindjals turned back toward the ground, concentrating\n> on the next cymek.\n>\n> However, when his assault squadron converged on another enemy, that\n> cymek also launched its escape pod, shooting the brain-case like a\n> cannonball into the sky. \"Hey,\" a pilot complained, \"he retreated\n> before we could give him a black eye!\"\n>\n> \"Maybe we activated their 'turn-tail-and-run' programs,\" another pilot\n> said with a snort.\n>\n> \"As long as they're retreating,\" Xavier said, barely able to hold on\n> to consciousness. He hoped he didn't spiral down and crash. \"Follow me\n> to the next target.\"\n>\n> As if in response to a signal, all the remaining cymeks abandoned\n> their warrior-forms. Escape containers blasted upward like fireworks,\n> vaulting blindly through the scrambler net and out into space, where\n> the robotic fleet could retrieve them.\n>\n> When the cymeks abandoned their assault, the surviving Salusan\n> defenders set up a ragged cheer from the wreckage on the ground.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> OVER THE NEXT several hours, Salusan survivors emerged from shelters,\n> blinking into the smoke-filled skies with a mixture of shock and\n> triumph.\n>\n> After the cymeks had retreated, the frustrated robot fleet had\n> launched a swarm of missiles at the ground, but their gelcircuitry\n> guidance computers also failed. Standard Salusan missile-defense\n> systems obliterated all of the machine weapons before they could reach\n> their targets.\n>\n> Finally, when the recalled battle groups began to converge on the\n> robot fleet, charging in from the perimeter of the Gamma Waiping\n> system, the thinking machines recalculated their chances for success,\n> didn't like the odds, and decided to retreat, leaving much wreckage in\n> orbit.\n>\n> On the surface, Zimia continued to burn, and tens of thousands of\n> bodies lay in the rubble.\n>\n> Xavier had held himself together for the battle, but in its aftermath\n> was barely able to stand. His lungs were full of blood; his mouth\n> tasted of acid. He had insisted that the medics and battlefield\n> surgeons concentrate on the more seriously wounded out in the streets.\n>\n> From a balcony on the top level of the damaged Hall of Parliament, he\n> gazed out at the horrendous damage. The world turned a sickly red\n> around him, and he wavered on his feet, then reeled backward. He heard\n> aides behind him, summoning a doctor.\n>\n> *I cannot consider this a victory*, he thought, then retreated into\n> black unconsciousness.\n>\n> *In the desert, the line between life and death is sharp and quick.*\n\n"}, {"id": "fdc56e4d-a5f8-44b4-8a2a-046864d65b49", "name": "Chapter 5", "content": "Chapter 5", "body": "", "metadata": {}, "type": null, "config": {}, "parent": null, "children": [{"id": "da4173bd-304d-4a6c-906b-31e68913fa0a", "name": "Erasmus's Villa on Corrin and His Experiments on Human Behavior", "content": "Erasmus's Villa on Corrin and His Experiments on Human Behavior", "body": "", "metadata": {}, "type": null, "config": {}, "parent": null, "children": [], "start": 1582, "end": 1582, "full_body": ""}, {"id": "6b12b221-e388-473b-be41-b85090a3a3d3", "name": "The Conversation Between Erasmus and Omnius", "content": "The Conversation Between Erasmus and Omnius", "body": "--- Zensunni Fire Poetry from Arrakis\n\n> **F**ar from thinking machines and the League of Nobles, the desert\n> never changed.

He sketched a deprecating Buddislamic symbol in the\n> sand, with an arrow on it that pointed back toward the cliff\n> dwellings.

He took the first of\n> the fist-sized stones he carried and hurled it as far as he could into\n> the gully between dunes. It landed with a *thump*--- and the ominous\n> track of the approaching worm diverted just a little.\n>\n> He tossed another rock, and a third, in a drumbeat pattern intended to\n> lure the worm away from him. Selim threw the rest of his stones, and\n> the beast turned only slightly, rising up in the dunes close to him.\n>\n> Empty handed, he now had no other way to divert the creature.\n>\n> Its maw open wide, the worm gulped sand and stones, searching for a\n> morsel of meat. The sand beneath Selim's boots shifted and crumbled at\n> the edge of the worm's path, and he knew the monster would swallow\n> him. He smelled an ominous cinammon stench on the worm's breath, saw\n> glimpses of fire in its gullet.\n>\n> Naib Dhartha would no doubt laugh at the young thief's fate. Selim\n> shouted a loud curse. And rather than surrender, he decided to attack.\n>\n> Closer to the cavernous mouth, the odor of spice intensified. The\n> young man gripped his metal walking stick and whispered a prayer. As\n> the worm lifted itself from beneath the dune, Selim leaped onto its\n> curved and crusty back. He raised the metal staff like a spear and\n> plunged the sharpened tip into what he thought would be tough, armored\n> worm-skin. Instead, the point slipped between segments, into soft pink\n> flesh.\n>\n> The beast reacted as if it had been shot with a maula cannon. It\n> reared up, thrashed, and writhed.\n>\n> Surprised, Selim drove the spear deeper and held on with all his\n> strength. He squeezed his eyes shut, clenching his teeth and pulling\n> back to keep himself steady. He would have no chance if he let go.\n>\n> Despite the worm's violent reaction, the little spear couldn't have\n> wounded it; this was merely a human gesture of defiance, a biting fly\n> thirsty for a sweet droplet of blood. Any moment now the worm would\n> dive back beneath the sand and drag Selim down with it.\n>\n> Surprisingly, though, the creature raced forward, keeping itself high\n> out of the dunes where the exposed tissue would not be abraded by\n> sand.\n>\n> Terrified, Selim clung to the implanted staff--- then laughed as he\n> realized he was actually *riding* Shaitan himself! Had anyone ever\n> done such a thing? If so, no man had ever lived to tell about it.\n>\n> Selim made a pact with himself and with Buddallah that he would not be\n> defeated, not by Naib Dhartha and not by this desert demon. He pulled\n> back on his spear and pried the fleshy segment even wider, making the\n> worm climb out of the sand, as if it could outrun the annoying\n> parasite on its back. . . .\n>\n> The young exile never made it to the strip of rock where he had hoped\n> to establish a private camp.

Multiprocessing as he conversed, the robot\n> captain continued the interplay with his subservient human copilot.\n> Seurat had a strange and unfortunate penchant for telling odd jokes.\n>\n> \"Vorian, what do you get when you breed a pig with a human?\"\n>\n> \"What?\"\n>\n> \"A creature that still eats a great deal, still stinks, and still does\n> no work!\"\n>\n> Vorian favored the captain with a polite chuckle. Most of the time,\n> Seurat's jokes only demonstrated that the robot did not truly\n> understand humor. But if Vor didn't laugh, Seurat would simply tell\n> another one, and another, until he obtained the desired reaction.\n> \"Aren't you afraid you'll make an error by telling jokes while\n> monitoring our navigation systems?\"\n>\n> \"I don't make mistakes,\" Seurat said, in his staccato mechanical\n> voice.\n>\n> Vor brightened with the challenge. \"Ah, but what if I sabotaged one of\n> the ship's vital functions? We're the only ones aboard, and I *am* a\n> deceitful human after all, your mortal enemy.

My father teaches me that,\n> despite our many weaknesses, we humans have a trump card with our very\n> unpredictability.\" Smiling, Vorian went to the robot captain's side\n> and studied the metric screens. \"Why do you think Omnius asks me to\n> throw a wrench into his careful simulations every time he plans an\n> encounter with the *hrethgir*?\"\n>\n> \"Your outrageous and reckless chaos is the only reason you are able to\n> beat me in any strategy game,\" Seurat said. \"It certainly has nothing\n> to do with your innate skills.\"\n>\n> \"A winner has more skills than a loser,\" Vor said, \"no matter how you\n> define the competition.\"\n>\n> The update ship traveled on a regular, continuous route throughout the\n> Synchronized Worlds. One of fifteen such vessels, the *Dream Voyager*\n> carried copies of the current version of Omnius to synchronize the\n> separate computer everminds on widely separated planets.\n>\n> Circuitry limitations and electronic transmission speeds constrained\n> the physical size of any individual machine; thus, the same computer\n> evermind could not viably extend beyond a single planet. Nonetheless,\n> duplicate copies of Omnius existed everywhere, like mental clones.\n> With regular updates continually exchanged by ships like the *Dream\n> Voyager*, all the separate Omnius incarnations remained virtually\n> identical across the machine-dominated autarchy.\n>\n> After many voyages, Vor knew how to operate the ship and could access\n> all onboard data banks using Seurat's codes. Over the years, he and\n> the robot captain had become fast friends in a way that others were\n> not likely to understand. Because of the extended time they shared in\n> deep space, talking about many things, playing games of skill, telling\n> stories--- they bridged much of the gap between machine and man.\n>\n> Sometimes, for amusement, Vor and Seurat traded places, and Vor\n> pretended to be the captain of the ship, while Seurat became his\n> robotic underling, as in the days of the Old Empire. During one\n> role-playing session, Vorian had impulsively christened the ship\n> *Dream Voyager*, a bit of poetic nonsense that Seurat not only\n> tolerated, but maintained.\n>\n> As a sentient machine, Seurat routinely received new instructions and\n> memory transfers from the overall Omnius brain, but because he spent\n> so much time disconnected while journeying between the stars, he had\n> developed his own personality and independence. In Vor's opinion,\n> Seurat was the best of the machine minds, although the robot could be\n> irritating at times. Especially with that peculiar sense of humor.\n>\n> Vor clasped his hands and cracked his knuckles. He sighed with\n> pleasure. \"Sure feels good to loosen up. Too bad it's something you\n> can't do.\"\n>\n> \"I do not require loosening up.\"\n>\n> Vorian didn't admit that he, too, found his own organic body to be\n> inferior in many ways, fragile and prone to aches, sicknesses, and\n> injuries that any machine could have easily fixed. He hoped that his\n> physical form would remain functional long enough for him to be made\n> into one of the enduring neo-cymeks, all of whom had once been valued\n> trustee humans, like himself. One day Agamemnon would receive\n> permission from Omnius for that, if Vor worked very hard to serve the\n> evermind.\n>\n> The *Dream Voyager* had been in space on a long update run, and the\n> young trustee was glad to be going home.

The strategy involved an\n> imaginary space battle between two alien races--- the \"Vorians\" and\n> the \"Seurats\"--- each of which had a space fleet with precise\n> capabilities and limitations. Though the robot captain had a perfect\n> machine memory, Vor still fared well, as he invariably came up with\n> creative tactics that surprised his opponent.\n>\n> Now, as they took turns placing warships in the various sectors of\n> their fanciful space battlefield, Seurat reeled off an endless\n> succession of human jokes and riddles he had found in his old\n> databases. Annoyed, Vor finally said, \"You're making an overt attempt\n> to distract me. Where did you learn to do that?\"\n>\n> \"Why, from you, of course.\" The robot proceeded to mention the many\n> times in which Vor had teased him, threatening to sabotage the ship\n> without ever really intending to do so, concocting extraordinarily\n> unpredictable emergencies. \"Do you consider it cheating? On your part,\n> or on mine?\"\n>\n> This revelation astonished Vor. \"It saddens me to think that, even in\n> jest, I have taught you deception. It makes me ashamed to be human.\"\n> No doubt, Agamemnon would be disappointed in him.\n>\n> After two more rounds, Vor lost the tactical game.

He knew Serena had worked vigorously with\n> the brilliant battlefield surgeons and a Tlulaxa flesh merchant named\n> Tuk Keedair to get him the treatment he needed.\n>\n> Now he could breathe again, despite intermittent bursts of pain.\n> Xavier would live to fight the machines another time. Thanks to\n> pharmaceuticals and advanced healing techniques, he had been able to\n> leave the hospital soon after the medical procedure.\n>\n> At the time of the attack, the flesh merchant Keedair had been in\n> Zimia on a routine sales call and barely escaped with his life. On the\n> Unallied Planet of Tlulax in the distant Thalim solar system, his\n> people ran organ farms, growing human hearts, lungs, kidneys, and\n> other body parts from viable cells. After the cymeks were driven away,\n> the secretive Tlulaxa had offered his biological wares to the\n> battlefield surgeons at Zimia's main field hospital. His ship's\n> cryogenic lockers were filled with sample body parts. A stroke of\n> luck, Keedair had admitted with a smile, that he could be there to\n> help the grievously injured Salusan citizens during their time of\n> great need.\n>\n> Following the successful surgery, Keedair had come to see Xavier in\n> the medical center. The Tlulaxa was a man of middle height but slight\n> of build, with dark eyes and an angular face. A long, dark braid hung\n> at the left side of his head, plaited tightly.\n>\n> Breathing in, carefully modulating his raspy voice, Xavier said, \"It\n> was fortunate you were here with new organs already stored aboard your\n> ship.\"\n>\n> Keedair rubbed his long-fingered hands together. \"If I had known the\n> cymeks would strike so ferociously, I would have brought a larger\n> supply of material from our organ farms. Your Salusan survivors could\n> use many more replacement parts, but additional ships cannot arrive\n> from the Thalim system for months.\"\n>\n> Before the flesh merchant left Xavier's room, he turned back and said,\n> \"Consider yourself one of the lucky ones, Tercero Harkonnen.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> IN BATTLE-SCARRED ZIMIA, grief-stricken survivors searched for their\n> dead, and buried them. As rubble was cleared, the death toll mounted.\n> Bodies were recovered, names of the missing were compiled. In spite of\n> such pain and sorrow, because of the attack free humanity grew\n> stronger.\n>\n> Viceroy Manion Butler had insisted that the people show only\n> determination in the aftermath. On the streets below Xavier's terrace,\n> final preparations were under way for a celebration of thanksgiving.\n> Banners\n>\n> with the open-hand sigil of human freedom fluttered in the wind.\n> Rough-looking men in dirty coats struggled to control magnificent\n> white Salusan stallions that had become agitated by the commotion. The\n> horses' manes were braided with tassles and bells, and their tails\n> swept behind them like waterfalls of fine hair. Festooned with ribbons\n> and flowers, the animals pranced, eager to march down the broad\n> central boulevard that had been washed clean of debris, soot, and\n> bloodstains.\n>\n> Xavier glanced uncertainly at the sky. How could he ever look at the\n> clouds again without dreading that he might see more pyramidal\n> dropcarriages plunging through the scrambler shields? Missiles were\n> already being installed, increased batteries to protect against an\n> attack from space. More patrols would be launched, circling the system\n> on the highest state of alert.\n>\n> Instead of attending a parade, he should be preparing the Salusan\n> Militia for another attack, increasing the number of picket ships and\n> scouts at the edge of the system, working out a more efficient rescue\n> and response plan. It was only a matter of time before the thinking\n> machines returned.\n>\n> The next meeting of the League Parliament would devote itself to\n> emergency measures and reparations. The representatives would sketch\n> out a reconstruction plan for Zimia. The cymek warrior-forms left\n> behind must be dismantled and analyzed for weaknesses.\n>\n> Xavier hoped the League would immediately dispatch a summons to\n> Poritrin, calling the brilliant Tio Holtzman to inspect his recently\n> installed scrambler shields. Only the great inventor himself could\n> devise a stopgap measure against the technical flaw the cymeks had\n> discovered.\n>\n> When Xavier mentioned his concerns to Viceroy Butler, the florid-faced\n> leader had nodded, but stopped further discussion. \"First, we must\n> have a day of affirmation, to celebrate the fact that we are alive.\"\n> Xavier saw deep sadness behind the Viceroy's mask of confidence. \"We\n> are not machines, Xavier. There must be more to our lives than war and\n> revenge.\"\n>\n> Hearing footsteps on the terrace, Xavier turned to see Serena Butler\n> smiling at him, her eyes flashing with a secret depth that she shared\n> with him now\n>\n> that no one could see the two of them. \"There is my heroic tercero.\"\n>\n> \"A man responsible for letting half a city be destroyed isn't usually\n> called a hero, Serena.\"\n>\n> \"No, but the term does apply to a man who saved the rest of the\n> planet. As you are fully aware, if you hadn't made your hard choice,\n> all of Zimia, all of Salusa, would have been crushed.\" She put a hand\n> on his shoulder and stood very close to him. \"I won't have you\n> wallowing in guilt during the victory parade. One day won't make much\n> difference.\"\n>\n> \"One day could very well make a *huge* difference,\" Xavier insisted.\n> \"We barely drove off the attackers this time because we were too\n> confident in the new scrambler shields, and because we foolishly\n> thought Omnius had decided to leave us alone after so many decades.\n> This would be the perfect time for them to hit us again. What if\n> they've launched a second wave?\"\n>\n> \"Omnius is still licking his wounds. I doubt his force has even\n> returned to the Synchronized Worlds yet.\"\n>\n> \"Machines don't lick wounds,\" he said.\n>\n> \"You're such a serious young man,\" she said. \"Please, just for the\n> parade? Our people need to have their spirits uplifted.\"\n>\n> \"Your father already gave me the same lecture.\"\n>\n> \"You know, of course, that if two Butlers say a thing, it's bound to\n> be true.\"\n>\n> He gave Serena a firm hug, then followed her from the terrace toward\n> the parade reviewing stand, where he would sit in a place of honor\n> beside the Viceroy.\n>\n> Since they'd been children, Xavier had always found himself attracted\n> to Serena; as they matured, they had grown confident of their\n> deepening feelings toward each other. Both he and Serena considered it\n> a foregone\n>\n> conclusion that they would wed, a rare perfect match of politics,\n> acceptable bloodlines, and romance.\n>\n> Now, though, with the sudden increase in hostilities, he reminded\n> himself of his greater priorities. Thanks to the disaster that had\n> killed Primero Meach, Xavier Harkonnen was interim commander of the\n> Salusan Militia, which forced him to face larger issues. He wanted to\n> do so much, but he was only one man.\n>\n> An hour later, the assemblage sat on a grandstand in the central\n> plaza. Scaffolding and temporary girders shored up the broken facades\n> of government buildings. The ornamental fountains no longer\n> functioned, but the citizens of Zimia knew there could be no other\n> place for such a presentation.\n>\n> Even burned and damaged, the tall edifices looked magnificent:\n> constructed in Salusan Gothic style with multilevel roof lines,\n> spires, and carved columns. Salusa Secundus was the seat of the League\n> government, but it also hosted the leading cultural and\n> anthropological museums. In surrounding neighborhoods, the crowded\n> dwellings were of simpler construction but pleasing to the eye,\n> whitewashed with lime taken from chalk cliffs. Salusans prided\n> themselves on having the best craftsmen and artisans in the League.\n> They did most of their production by hand instead of with automated\n> machinery.\n>\n> Along the parade route, the citizens dressed in colorful raiment of\n> magenta, blue, and yellow. People chattered and pointed as the\n> remarkable stallions passed them, followed by marching musicians and\n> folk dancers on hover-floats. One monstrous Salusan bull, drugged into\n> a near stupor to control it, plodded down the street.\n>\n> Though Xavier made the best of it all, he found himself constantly\n> glancing at the sky, and at the scars of the wounded city. . . .\n>\n> At the conclusion of the parade, Manion Butler delivered a speech\n> celebrating the successful defense but acknowledging the high cost of\n> the battle, tens of thousands killed or wounded. \"We have much healing\n> and\n>\n> recovery to do, but we also have an unbroken spirit, no matter what\n> the thinking machines may attempt.\"\n>\n> Addressing the crowd, the Viceroy summoned Xavier to the central\n> platform. \"I present for you our greatest hero, a man who stood firm\n> against the cymeks and made the *necessary* decisions to save us all.\n> Few others would have been strong enough to do the same.\"\n>\n> Feeling out of place, Xavier stepped forward to receive a military\n> medal on a striped blue, red, and gold ribbon from the Viceroy. In the\n> midst of cheers, Serena kissed him on the cheek. He hoped no one in\n> the crowd could see him blush.\n>\n> \"With this commendation comes a promotion to the rank of Tercero,\n> First Grade. Xavier Harkonnen, I charge you with studying defensive\n> tactics and installations for the entire League Armada. Your duties\n> will encompass the local Salusan Militia, along with responsibility\n> for improving the military security of the entire League of Nobles.\"\n>\n> The young officer felt awkward from the attention, but he graciously\n> accepted the accolades. \"I look forward to beginning the hard work of\n> our survival . . . and advancement.\" He favored Serena with an\n> indulgent smile. \"Following today's festivities, of course.\"\n>\n> *Dune is the planet-child of the worm.*\n\n--- from \"The Legend of Selim Wormrider,\" Zensunni Fire Poetry\n\n> **F**or an entire day and deep into the night, the monstrous sandworm\n> raced across the desert, forced beyond its normal territorial range.\n>\n> As the two moons rose and shone their curious light down upon Selim,\n> he clung to his metal staff, completely exhausted. Though he had\n> escaped being devoured by the wild and confused creature, he might\n> soon perish from the interminable ride. Buddallah had saved him, but\n> now seemed only to be toying with him.\n>\n> While thrusting the corroded spear, the youth had wedged himself into\n> a gap between worm segments, hoping he wouldn't be buried alive if the\n> demon plunged beneath the dunes. He huddled against rank flesh that\n> smelled of rotten meat impregnated with pungent cinnamon. He didn't\n> know what to do, but prayed and contemplated, searching for an\n> explanation.\n>\n> *Perhaps it is a test of some kind.*\n>\n> The sandworm continued to flee across the desert, its undersized brain\n> seemingly resigned to never again finding peace or safety. The beast\n> wanted to wallow into the dunes and hide from this malicious imp, but\n> Selim pried the spear as if it were a lever, irritating the wound\n> anew.\n>\n> The worm could only surge onward. Hour after hour.\n>\n> Selim's throat was parched, his eyes caked with grit. He must have\n> crossed half the desert already, and recognized no landforms on the\n> monotonous open bled. He had never been so far from the cave\n> community--- no one had, as far as he knew. Even if he somehow escaped\n> this giant monster, he would be doomed in the unforgiving Arrakis\n> wasteland because of his unjust sentence.\n>\n> He was certain his faithless friend Ebrahim would be exposed one day,\n> and the truth would come out; the traitor would violate other tribal\n> rules, and would eventually be recognized for the thief and liar that\n> he was. If Selim ever saw him again, he would challenge Ebrahim to a\n> fight to the death, and honor would win out.\n>\n> Perhaps the tribe would applaud him, since no one in even the grandest\n> fire poems had ever braved a giant sandworm and lived. Maybe the\n> saucy, dark-eyed young Zensunni women would look at Selim with bright\n> smiles. Dust-covered but with his head held high, he would stand\n> before stern Naib Dhartha and demand readmittance to the community. To\n> have ridden a desert demon and *lived!*\n>\n> But, though Selim had already managed to survive longer than he had\n> ever hoped, the outcome was by no means assured. What was he to do\n> now?\n>\n> Beneath him, the worm made peculiar, agitated noises, an invertebrate\n> sound beyond the loud whisper of hot sand. The weary beast shuddered,\n> and a tremor ran down its sinuous body. Selim could smell flint and an\n> overpowering aroma of spice. Friction-induced furnaces burned inside\n> the worm's gullet, like the depths of Sheol itself.\n>\n> As lemony dawn tinged the sky, the worm became more unruly and\n> desperate. It thrashed about, trying to dig itself into the sand, but\n> Selim wouldn't permit that. The monster slammed its blunt head into a\n> dune, smashing a dust spray into the air. The youth had to throw all\n> of his body weight against the spear, digging into the raw, exposed\n> worm segment.\n>\n> \"You are as sore and exhausted as I am, aren't you, Shaitan?\" he said\n> in a voice as thin and dry as paper. *Almost exhausted unto death*.\n>\n> Selim didn't dare let go. The moment he dropped off onto the barren\n> dunes, the sandworm would turn about and devour him. He had no choice\n> but to keep driving the creature. The ordeal seemed endless.\n>\n> As daylight grew brighter, he noticed a faint haze on the far horizon,\n> a distant storm with winds bearing flakes of sand and dust. But the\n>\n> disturbance was far away, and Selim had other concerns.\n>\n> At last, the demon worm ground itself to a halt not far from a ridge\n> of rocks, and refused to move. With a final convulsion, it slumped its\n> serpentine head onto a dune crest and lay like a slain dragon,\n> quivering . . . then went utterly still.\n>\n> Selim trembled with absolute weariness, fearing this was some kind of\n> final trick. The monster might be waiting for him to drop his guard so\n> it could swallow him up. Could a sandworm be devious? Was it truly\n> Shaitan?*Or did I ride it to death?*\n>\n> Gathering his energy, Selim straightened. His cramped muscles\n> trembled. He could barely move. Joints were numb; nerves prickled as\n> they awakened with the creeping fire of restored circulation. At last,\n> risking all, he yanked the metal spear from the pink flesh between the\n> callused segments.\n>\n> The worm didn't even twitch.\n>\n> Selim slid down the rounded bulk and hit the sand running. His boots\n> pumped up little dust clouds as he raced across the undulating\n> landscape. The far-off rocks were black mounds of safety protruding\n> from golden dunes.\n>\n> He refused to look behind him and ran on, gasping. Each breath was\n> like dry fire in his throat. His ears tingled, anticipating the hiss\n> of sand, the rippling approach of the vengeful creature. But the\n> sandworm remained still.\n>\n> Filled with desperate energy, Selim sprinted for half a kilometer.\n> Reaching the rock barricade, he scrambled up and finally allowed\n> himself to collapse. Drawing his knees against his chest, he sat\n> gazing out into the wash of daylight, watching the worm.\n>\n> It never moved. *Is Shaitan playing a trick? Is Buddallah testing me?*\n>\n> By now Selim was very, very hungry. He shouted at the sky, \"If you\n> have saved me for some purpose, then why not offer a bit of food?\" In\n> the extremity of his exhaustion, he began to chuckle.\n>\n> *One does not make demands of God*.\n>\n> Then he realized that there was food, of a sort. In his flight to the\n> rock sanctuary, Selim had crossed a thick ochre patch of spice, veins\n> of melange like those the Zensunni sometimes found when they ventured\n> onto the sands. They gathered the substance, using it as a food\n> additive and stimulant. Naib Dhartha kept a small stockpile within the\n> cave warrens, occasionally brewing from it a potent spice beer, which\n> the tribe members consumed on special occasions and traded at the\n> Arrakis City spaceport.\n>\n> He sat in the uncertain shade for nearly an hour, looking for any sign\n> of movement from the monster. Nothing. The day became hotter, and the\n> desert lapsed into a sluggish silence. The distant storm seemed to\n> move no closer. Selim felt as if the world itself was holding its\n> breath.\n>\n> Then, growing brash again--- after all, he had ridden Shaitan!---\n> Selim crawled down from the rocks and scurried out to the patch of\n> melange. There, he raised a wary gaze in the direction of the ominous\n> hulk.\n>\n> Standing in the rust-hued sand, he scrabbled with his hands, scooping\n> up the dry red powder. He gobbled it, spat out a few grains of sand,\n> and immediately felt the stimulant of raw spice, a large quantity to\n> take all at once. It made him dizzy, gave him an explosion of energy.\n>\n> Finally sated, he stood at a distance from the flaccid worm, hands on\n> his hips, glaring. Then he waved his arms, shouting into the utter\n> silence, \"I defeated you, Shaitan! You meant to eat me, old crawler,\n> but I conquered you instead!\" He waved his hands again. \"Can you hear\n> me?\"\n>\n> But he detected not even a flicker. Euphoric from the melange and\n> foolishly brave, he marched back toward the long sinuous body that lay\n> on the dune crest. Only a few footsteps away, he stared up into the\n> face. Its cavernous\n>\n> mouth was studded with glittering internal thorns. The long fangs\n> looked like the tiniest of hairs in relation to the creature's immense\n> size.\n>\n> Now the dust storm approached, accompanied by skirling hot breezes.\n> The wind seized grains of sand and fragments of rock, whipping them\n> against his face like tiny darts. Gusts stole around the curved\n> carcass of the worm with a whispery, hooting sound. It seemed as if\n> the ghost of the beast was *daring him*, prodding him forward. The\n> spice thrummed in Selim's bloodstream.\n>\n> Boldly, he strode to the worm's maw and peered into the black infinity\n> of its mouth. The hellish friction-fires inside were cold; not even an\n> ember remained.\n>\n> He shouted again, \"I killed you, old crawler. I am Worm Slayer.\" The\n> sandworm did not respond even to this provocation.\n>\n> He looked up at the daggerlike fangs, curved shards that lined the\n> wide, smelly mouth. Buddallah seemed to be urging him on, or maybe it\n> was simply his own desire. Moving before common sense could catch up\n> with him, Selim climbed over the lower lip of the worm and reached the\n> nearest sharp tooth.\n>\n> The young outcast grabbed it with both hands, feeling how hard it was,\n> a material even stronger than metal. He twisted and wrenched. The\n> worm's body was soft, as if the tissues of its throat were losing\n> integrity. With a suppressed grunt, Selim uprooted the fang. It was as\n> long as his forearm, curved and pure and glistening with milky\n> whiteness. It would make an excellent knife.\n>\n> He staggered back out, holding his prize, utterly terrified at the\n> realization of what he had done. An unprecedented act, as far as he\n> knew. Who else would have risked not only riding Shaitain, but\n> stepping into its maw? His body trembled to its core. He couldn't\n> believe what he had dared--- and accomplished! No other person on all\n> of Arrakis possessed a treasure such as this tooth-knife!\n>\n> Although the remaining crystalline fangs hung down like stalactites,\n> hundreds of them that he could sell in the Arrakis City spaceport (if\n> he could ever find the place again), he felt suddenly weak. The rush\n> of the melange he'd consumed was beginning to fade.\n>\n> He scrambled backward onto the soft sand. The storm was almost on top\n> of him now, reminding him of his Zensunni desert survival training. He\n> must make his way back to the rocks and find some sort of shelter, or\n> he too would soon lie dead upon the dunes, a victim of the elements.\n>\n> But he no longer thought that would happen. *I have a destiny now, a\n> mission from Buddallah . . . if only I can understand it*.\n>\n> He backed away, then turned and ran toward the line of rocks, cradling\n> the fang in his hands. The wind nudged him onward as if anxious to get\n> him away from the carcass.\n>\n> *Humans tried to develop intelligent machines as secondary reflex\n> systems, turning over primary decisions to mechanical servants.\n> Gradually, though, the creators did not leave enough to do for\n> themselves; they began to feel alienated, dehumanized, and even\n> manipulated. Eventually humans became little more than decisionless\n> robots themselves, left without an understanding of their natural\n> existence.*\n\n--- TLALOC,\n\n*Weaknesses of the Empire*\n\n> **A**gamemnon was not eager to face Omnius. Having already lived more\n> than a thousand years, the cymek general had learned to be patient.\n>\n> As patient as a machine.\n>\n> Following their secret rendezvous near the red dwarf star, he and his\n> fellow Titans reached Corrin after an interstellar voyage of nearly\n> two months. The robotic fleet had arrived days before, delivering the\n> battle images captured by the watcheyes. The evermind already knew\n> about the defeat. All that remained was for Omnius to issue rebukes\n> and reprimands, especially to Agamemnon, who had been in command.\n>\n> As he landed his ship under the blazing giant sun of Corrin, the cymek\n> general reached out with his sensor network, accepting data through\n> his thoughtrodes. Omnius would be waiting, as always, after a mission.\n>\n> Perhaps by now the evermind would have accepted the failure.\n>\n> A false hope, Agamemnon knew. The all-pervasive computer did not react\n> in the manner of a human.\n>\n> Before emerging from his ship, the Titan general chose an efficient\n> mobile body, little more than a streamlined cart that carried his\n> brain canister and life-support systems connected to the framework.\n> The cymek moved out\n>\n> onto the paved boulevards under the enormous baleful eye of the red\n> giant.\n>\n> Harsh crimson light washed the flagstoned streets and white facades.\n>\n> Millennia ago, the bloated star had expanded, growing so large that\n> its outer layers swallowed the inner planets of the system. Corrin\n> itself had once been a frozen outlying world, but the increased heat\n> from the swollen giant now made the planet habitable.\n>\n> After the atmosphere thawed and the icy seas boiled away, Corrin's\n> landscape became a blank slate on which the Old Empire established a\n> colony during its younger, ambitious days. Most of the ecosystem had\n> been transplanted from elsewhere, but even after thousands of years\n> Corrin still seemed an *unfinished* world, missing many of the\n> ecological details necessary for a thriving planet. Omnius and his\n> independent robot Erasmus liked the place because it seemed new and\n> unburdened by the baggage of history.\n>\n> Agamemnon trundled along the streets, followed by hovering watcheyes\n> that monitored him like electronic guard dogs. With surveillance\n> monitors and speakers throughout the city, the evermind could have\n> conferred with him anywhere on Corrin. Omnius, however, insisted on\n> receiving the cymek general in a lavish central pavilion built by\n> human slave labor. This pilgrimage of contrition was part of\n> Agamemnon's penance for the Salusa failure. The powerful computer\n> understood the concept of dominance.\n>\n> The electrafluid surrounding his brain churned blue as Agamemnon\n> prepared to defend himself against a rigorous interrogation. His\n> mobile body passed under tall arches supported by scrolled white-metal\n> columns. Eccentric and earnest, the robot Erasmus had copied\n> ostentatious trappings from historical records of human empires. The\n> awesome gateway was designed to make visitors tremble, though the\n> Titan doubted Omnius cared about such things.\n>\n> The cymek general halted at the center of a courtyard where fountains\n> trickled from gaps in the walls. Tame sparrows flitted about the eaves\n> and\n>\n> nested atop the pillars. Inside terra cotta urns, scarlet lilies\n> bloomed in violent explosions of petals.\n>\n> \"I have arrived, Lord Omnius,\" Agamemnon announced through his voice\n> synthesizer--- a mere formality, because he had been closely observed\n> since emerging from his ship. He waited.\n>\n> In the echoing pavilion, the mirror-faced Erasmus was nowhere to be\n> seen. Omnius wanted to upbraid his general without the curious\n> scrutiny of the independent and annoying robot. Though Erasmus fancied\n> that he understood human emotions, Agamemnon doubted the eccentric\n> machine would show even a glimmer of compassion.\n>\n> The voice boomed from a dozen speakers in the walls, like an angry\n> deity. No doubt the effect was intentional. \"You and your cymeks have\n> failed, General.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon already knew how the discussion would play out--- as did\n> Omnius. Surely the evermind himself had run simulations. Yet, this was\n> a dance that must be continued.\n>\n> \"We fought hard, but could not achieve victory, Lord Omnius. The\n> *hrethgir* put up an unexpectedly fierce defense and were surprisingly\n> willing to sacrifice their city rather than let the shield generators\n> fall. As I have said many times, feral humans are dangerously\n> unpredictable.\"\n>\n> Omnius responded without hesitation. \"You have repeatedly insisted\n> that cymeks are far superior to the human vermin, combining the best\n> advantages of machine and man. How, then, could you be rebuffed by\n> such untrained, uncivilized creatures?\"\n>\n> \"In this instance, I was in error. The humans realized our true\n> objective faster than we had anticipated.\"\n>\n> \"Your forces did not fight hard enough,\" Omnius said.\n>\n> \"Six neo-cymeks were destroyed. The gladiator body of the Titan Xerxes\n> was demolished, and he barely escaped in a launch pod.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, but the remainder of your cymeks survived. A mere twenty-one\n> percent loss does not equate with 'fighting to your fullest.'\" Around\n> the courtyard, chirping sparrows flitted about, oblivious to the\n> tension between Omnius and his top military officer. \"You should have\n> been willing to sacrifice all your cymeks to bring down the scrambler\n> shields.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon was glad he no longer displayed human expressions, which the\n> computer mind might be able to interpret. \"Lord Omnius, cymeks are\n> irreplaceable *individuals*, unlike your robotic thinking machines. In\n> my estimation, risking the loss of your most vital Titans was not a\n> reasonable exchange for one insignificant planet infested with feral\n> humans.\"\n>\n> \"Insignificant? Before the mission you emphasized the extreme\n> importance of Salusa Secundus to the League of Nobles. You claimed\n> that its fall would precipitate a complete collapse of free humanity.\n> *You* were in command.\"\n>\n> \"But is the League itself worth the obliteration of your remaining\n> Titans? We created you, established the foundation for your\n> Synchronized Worlds. The Titans should be used for more than cannon\n> fodder.\" Agamemnon was curious as to how the evermind would respond to\n> this line of reasoning. Perhaps by setting up the Titans to fall in\n> battle against feral humans, Omnius planned to bypass the choke-hold\n> of Barbarossa's protective programming.\n>\n> \"Let me ponder that,\" Omnius said. Screens on the pavilion walls\n> projected watcheye images from the battle on Zimia. \"The *hrethgir*\n> are smarter than you presumed. They saw your target. You made an error\n> in judgment thinking your cymeks would be able to push forward\n> easily.\"\n>\n> \"I miscalculated,\" Agamemnon admitted. \"The humans have a clever\n> military commander. His unexpected decisions allowed them to mount a\n> successful resistance. Now, at least, we have tested their scrambler\n> fields.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon's explanations rapidly degenerated into a succession of\n> rationalizations and excuses. Omnius analyzed and dismissed them,\n> leaving the Titan feeling bare and humiliated.\n>\n> In the serene courtyard, bright flowers bloomed and birds sang.\n> Trickling fountains added their musical sounds . . . and Agamemnon\n> contained his outrage within himself. Even his sensitive mechanical\n> body showed no sign of agitation. A thousand years ago, he and his\n> fellow Titans had controlled these damnable thinking machines. *We\n> created you, Omnius. One day, we will also destroy you.*\n>\n> While it had taken the visionary Tlaloc and his group of rebels only a\n> few years to conquer the sleepy Old Empire, Omnius and his thinking\n> machines proved to be a far superior adversary, never sleeping, always\n> watching. But even machines made mistakes. Agamemnon just needed to\n> exploit them.\n>\n> \"Is there anything else, Lord Omnius?\" he interrupted. Further\n> arguments and excuses would serve no purpose. Above all else, machines\n> craved efficiency.\n>\n> \"Only my next set of instructions, Agamemnon.\" The Omnius voice moved\n> from speaker to speaker, giving the impression that he was everywhere\n> at once. \"I am dispatching you and your Titans back to Earth. You will\n> accompany Erasmus, who intends to continue his studies of captive\n> humans there.\"\n>\n> \"As you command, Lord Omnius.\" Though surprised, Agamemnon showed no\n> reaction. *Earth* . . . a very long journey. \"We will determine other\n> ways to destroy this blight of humanity. The Titans exist only to\n> serve you.\"\n>\n> It was one of the few advantages of Agamemnon's human side: Even\n> though the evermind was filled with a vast quantity of data, Omnius\n> did not know how to recognize a simple lie.\n>\n> *From a certain perspective, defense and offense encompass nearly\n> identical tactics.*\n\n--- XAVIER HARKONNEN,\n\nraddress to Salusan Militia\n\n> **N**ew duties, new responsibilities . . . and more good-byes. As a\n> mostly recovered Xavier Harkonnen stood with Serena Butler inside the\n> Zimia Spaceport, the departure facility seemed a sterile environment\n> with echoing plaztile floors.

His facial features were not particularly\n> striking--- ruddy complexion, pointed nose, generous lips--- but\n> overall she found him attractive, especially the soft brown eyes and\n> his infectious, though rarely used, smile.\n>\n> \"I wish we could spend more time together, Xavier.\" She fingered a\n> white rose floweret on her lapel. The spaceport drone of other people,\n> noisy repair crews and heavy machinery surrounded them.\n>\n> Xavier noticed Serena's younger sister Octa watching them. A\n> seventeen-year-old with long strawberry-blond hair, she'd always had a\n> crush on Xavier. Willowy Octa was a nice enough girl, but recently he\n> wished she would give him and Serena a little more privacy, especially\n> now that they would be apart for so long.\n>\n> \"So do I. Let's make these minutes count.\" Surrendering to the urge he\n> knew they both shared, he leaned forward to kiss her, as if his lips\n> were drawn by a magnetic force. The kiss lingered, then grew intense.\n> At last Xavier pulled back. Serena looked disappointed, more with the\n> situation than with him. They both had important duties, demands on\n> their time and energy.\n>\n> Newly installed in his position, Xavier was about to embark with a\n> group of military specialists on an inspection tour of League\n> planetary defenses. After the nearly successful cymek strike against\n> Salusa two months ago, he would make certain there were no weaknesses\n> on other League Worlds. The thinking machines would exploit the\n> tiniest flaw, and free humans could not afford to lose any of their\n> remaining strongholds.\n>\n> Serena Butler, meanwhile, would focus on expanding the League domain.\n> After the battlefield surgeons had been so successful with the fresh\n> tank-grown organs provided by Tuk Keedair, Serena had spoken\n> passionately about the services and resources the Unallied Planets\n> such as Tlulaxa could provide. She wanted them to formally join the\n> union of free humans.\n>\n> Already, more flesh merchants had arrived on Salusa with their\n> biological wares; previously, many nobles and League citizens had been\n> uneasy about the mysterious outsiders, but now that the war-wounded\n> faced terrible losses of limbs and organs, they were willing to accept\n> cloned replacement parts. The Tlulaxa never explained where they had\n> developed or obtained such sophisticated biological technology, but\n> Serena praised their generosity and resources.\n>\n> At any other time, her speech in the Hall of Parliament might have\n> been forgotten, but the cymek attack had underscored her point about\n> the vulnerability of the Unallied Planets. What if the machines next\n> chose to wipe out the Thalim system and thereby eliminate the Tlulaxan\n> ability to give sight to blind veterans, new limbs to amputees?\n>\n> She had studied hundreds of survey documents and ambassadorial\n> reports, trying to determine which of the nonsignatory planets were\n> the best\n>\n> candidates for induction into the League brotherhood. Unifying the\n> remnants of humanity had become her passion, to make the free people\n> strong enough to put down any machine aggression.\n>\n> Despite her youth, she had already led two successful aid missions,\n> the first when she was only seventeen. In one she had taken food and\n> medical supplies to refugees from an abandoned Synchronized World, and\n> in the other she had provided relief for a biological blight that\n> almost destroyed the pristine farms on Poritrin.\n>\n> Neither she nor Xavier had time for themselves.\n>\n> \"When you return, I promise I will make it up to you,\" she said, her\n> eyes dancing. \"I'll give you a banquet of kisses.\"\n>\n> He allowed himself a rare laugh. \"Then I plan to arrive very hungry\n> indeed!\" Xavier took her hand and kissed it gallantly. \"When we dine\n> again, I shall come calling with flowers.\" He knew their next\n> rendezvous could be months away.\n>\n> She gave him a warm smile. \"I have a particular fondness for flowers.\"\n>\n> He was about to pull Serena close, but they were interrupted by a\n> familiar brown-skinned child coming from another direction--- Xavier's\n> eight-year-old brother, Vergyl Tantor. The boy had been permitted to\n> leave school to see him off. Breaking free of an elderly instructor\n> escort, Vergyl ran to hug his idol, nuzzling his face into the crisp\n> uniform shirt.\n>\n> \"Take care of our estate while I am gone, little brother,\" Xavier\n> said, playfully rubbing his knuckles on the boy's wiry hair. \"You are\n> in charge of tending my wolfhounds--- you understand?\"\n>\n> The boy's brown eyes widened, and he nodded gravely. \"Yes.\"\n>\n> \"And obey your parents, otherwise you can't hope to grow up to become\n> a good officer in the Armada.\"\n>\n> \"I will!\"\n>\n> An announcement summoned the inspection team to board the shuttle.\n> Hearing it, Xavier promised to bring something back for Vergyl, Octa,\n> and Serena. While Octa watched from a distance, smiling hopefully, he\n> hugged his little brother again, squeezed Serena's hand, and strode\n> off with the officers and engineers.\n>\n> Staring at the window wall where they could watch the waiting military\n> shuttle, Serena glanced down at the boy and thought of Xavier\n> Harkonnen. Xavier had been only six years old when thinking machines\n> had killed his natural parents and his older brother.\n>\n> Because of interfamily agreements and the written wills of Ulf and\n> Katarina Harkonnen, young Xavier had been raised as the foster son of\n> powerful and then-childless Emil and Lucille Tantor. The noble couple\n> had already made arrangements for their holdings to be administered by\n> Tantor relatives, distant cousins and nephews who would not normally\n> have inherited anything. But when Emil Tantor began to raise Xavier,\n> he was quite taken with the orphan and legally adopted him, though\n> Xavier retained his Harkonnen name and all associated noble rights.\n>\n> After the adoption, Lucille Tantor unexpectedly conceived a son,\n> Vergyl, who was twelve years younger than Xavier. The Harkonnen heir,\n> not worried about dynastic politics, concentrated on a course of\n> military studies, intending to join the League Armada. At the age of\n> eighteen Xavier received the legal entitlement to the original\n> Harkonnen holdings, and a year later he became an officer in the\n> Salusan Militia. With his impeccable performance and rapid promotions,\n> everyone could see Xavier was a rising star in the military ranks.\n>\n> Now three people who cared about him watched the shuttle lift into the\n> sky on a plume of orange exhaust. Vergyl held Serena's hand, bravely\n> trying to comfort her. \"Xavier will be all right. You can count on\n> him.\"\n>\n> She felt a pang for her departing love, but smiled warmly at the\n> wide-eyed boy. \"Of course we can.\"\n>\n> She would have it no other way. Love was one of the things that\n> separated humans from machines.\n>\n> *The answer is a mirror of the question.*\n\n--- COGITOR KWYNA,\n\nCity of Introspection archives\n\n> **T**he temporary meeting chamber for the League delegates had\n> originally been the home of the first Viceroy, Bovko Manresa. Before\n> the Titans had taken over the weak Old Empire, Manresa had built the\n> mansion on then-isolated Salusa Secundus as a way of celebrating\n> wealth garnered from his planetary land dealings. Later, when refugee\n> humans began arriving, driven out by the cruel rule of the Twenty\n> Titans, the big house had become a meeting hall, with chairs and a\n> lectern set up in the grand ballroom, as they were today.\n>\n> Months ago, within hours of the cymek attack, Viceroy Butler had stood\n> on a pile of rubble beneath the broken central dome of the Hall of\n> Parliament. While the poisonous dust settled in the streets and fires\n> still blazed in damaged buildings, he had vowed to repair the\n> venerable old facility that had served the League for centuries.\n>\n> The governmental edifice was more than just a building: It was\n> hallowed ground on which legendary leaders had debated great ideas and\n> formulated plans against the machines. The damage to the roof and\n> upper floors was severe, but the basic structure remained sound. Just\n> like the human spirit it represented.\n>\n> It was a frosty morning outside, with fog on the windows. Leaves on\n> the hills had begun to turn lovely autumn shades of yellow, orange,\n> and brown. Serena and the representatives came inside the temporary\n> meeting hall, still clinging to their coats.\n>\n> She gazed at the walls of the crowded old ballroom, at paintings of\n> long-dead leaders and depictions of past victories. She wondered what\n> the future would bring, and what her place might be in it. She wanted\n> so badly to *do* something, to help in the great crusade of humankind.\n>\n> Most of her life she had been an activist, always willing to get her\n> hands dirty, to assist in aiding the victims of other tragedies such\n> as natural disasters or machine attacks. Even during pleasant times,\n> she had joined the work crews of harvesters to pick grapes from the\n> Butler estate vineyards or olives from the gnarled groves.\n>\n> She took a seat in the first row, then watched as her soft-featured\n> father made his way across the wood parquet floor to the antique\n> lectern. Viceroy Butler was followed by a monk in a red-velvet tunic\n> carrying a large plexiplaz container that held a living human brain in\n> viscous electrafluid. The monk lovingly placed the container on an\n> ornate table beside the lectern, then stood beside it.\n>\n> From her front-row seat, Serena saw the pinkish gray tissue undulate\n> slightly within the pale-blue life-support liquid. Separated from the\n> senses and distractions of the physical world for more than a\n> millennium, stimulated by constant intense contemplation, the female\n> Cogitor's once-human brain had grown larger than its original size.\n>\n> \"The Cogitor Kwyna does not often leave the City of Introspection,\"\n> Viceroy Butler said, sounding both formal and excited. \"But in these\n> times we require the best thoughts and advice. If any mind can\n> understand the thinking machines, it will be Kwyna's.\"\n>\n> These esoteric disembodied philosophers were seen so infrequently that\n> many League representatives did not understand how they managed to\n> communicate. Compounding the mystery that surrounded them, Cogitors\n> rarely said much, choosing instead to marshall their energies and\n> contribute only the most important thoughts.\n>\n> \"The Cogitor's Secondary will speak for Kwyna,\" the Viceroy said, \"if\n> she has any insights to offer.\"\n>\n> Beside the brain canister, the red-robed monk removed the sealed lid,\n> exposing the agitated viscous fluid. Blinking his round eyes rapidly,\n> he stared into the tank. Slowly, the monk slid one naked hand into the\n> soup, immersing his fingers. He closed his eyes, drawing deep breaths,\n> as he\n>\n> tentatively touched the convoluted brain. His brows furrowed with\n> concentration and acceptance as the electrafluid soaked into his\n> pores, linking the Cogitor with the Secondary's neural system, using\n> him as an extension in much the same way cymeks used artificial\n> mechanical bodies.\n>\n> \"I understand nothing,\" said the monk in a strange, distant voice.\n> Serena knew that was the first principle the Cogitors adopted, and the\n> contemplative brains spent centuries in deep study, adding to that\n> sense of nothingness.\n>\n> Centuries before the original Titans, a group of spiritual humans had\n> enjoyed studying philosophy and discussing esoteric issues, but too\n> many frailties and temptations of the flesh inhibited their ability to\n> concentrate. In the ennui of the Old Empire, these metaphysical\n> scholars had been the first to have their brains installed in\n> life-support systems. Freed of biological constraints, they spent all\n> their time learning and thinking. Each Cogitor wanted to study the\n> entirety of human philosophy, bringing together the ingredients to\n> understand the universe. They lived in ivory towers and contemplated,\n> rarely bothering to note the superficial relationships and events of\n> the mundane world.\n>\n> Kwyna, the two-thousand-year-old Cogitor who resided in Salusa's City\n> of Introspection, claimed to be politically neutral. \"I am ready to\n> interact,\" she announced through the monk, who stared with glazed eyes\n> at the assembly. \"You may begin.\"\n>\n> With intense blue eyes, Viceroy Butler gazed around the packed\n> ballroom, pausing to look at a number of faces, including Serena's.\n> \"My friends, we have always lived under the threat of annihilation,\n> and now I must ask every one of you to devote your time, energies, and\n> money to our cause.\"\n>\n> He gave tribute to the tens of thousands of Salusans who had died in\n> the cymek onslaught, along with fifty-one visiting dignitaries. \"The\n> Salusan Militia remains on full alert here, and messenger ships have\n> been dispatched to all League Worlds, warning them of the danger. We\n> can only hope that no other planets were attacked.\"\n>\n> The Viceroy then called upon Tio Holtzman, recently arrived after\n> nearly a month in transit from his laboratories on Poritrin. \"Savant\n> Holtzman, we are anxious to hear your assessment of the new defenses.\"\n>\n> Holtzman had been eager to inspect his orbital scrambler fields, to\n> see how they might be modified and improved. On Poritrin, the\n> flamboyant nobleman Niko Bludd funded the Savant's research. Given his\n> past accomplishments, League members always held out the hope that\n> Holtzman would pull some other miracle out of his pocket.\n>\n> Slight of body, Holtzman moved with grace and an enormous stage\n> presence, wearing clean and stylish robes. The iron gray hair that\n> hung to his shoulders was square-cut, framing a narrow face. A man of\n> immense confidence and ego, he loved to speak to important dignitaries\n> in the Parliament, but now he appeared uncharacteristically troubled.\n> In truth, the inventor could not bring himself to admit a mistake.\n> Unquestionably, his scrambler network had failed. The cymeks had\n> broken through! What would he say to these people who had relied on\n> him?\n>\n> Reaching the speaking platform, the great man cleared his throat and\n> looked around, glancing oddly at the imposing presence of the Cogitor\n> and the looming attendant monk. This was a most delicate matter. How\n> could he shift the blame from himself?\n>\n> The scientist used his best voice. \"In warfare, whenever one side\n> makes a technological breakthrough, the other attempts to top it. We\n> recently witnessed this with my atmospheric scrambler fields. Had they\n> not been installed here, the full thinking machine fleet would have\n> laid waste to Salusa. Unfortunately, I did not factor in the unique\n> abilities of the cymeks. They found a chink in the armor and\n> penetrated it.\"\n>\n> No one had accused him of lax work or poor planning, but this was the\n> closest Holtzman would come to admitting that he had overlooked a\n> major flaw. \"Now it is our turn to surpass the machines with a new\n> concept. I hope to be inspired by this tragedy, pushing my creativity\n> to its limits.\" He then\n>\n> stalled and looked embarrassed, even endearing. \"I'll be working on\n> that, as soon as I get back to Poritrin. I hope to have a surprise for\n> you very soon.\"\n>\n> A tall, statuesque woman glided toward the lectern, drawing attention\n> to herself. \"Perhaps I have a suggestion.\" She had pale eyebrows,\n> white hair, and luminous skin that made her seem ethereal, but charged\n> with power.\n>\n> \"Let us hear from the women of Rossak. I gladly yield to Zufa Cenva.\"\n> Looking relieved, Holtzman hurried back to his seat and slumped into\n> it.\n>\n> The pale woman carried an air of mystery about her; she wore glowing\n> jewelry on a black, diaphanous gown that revealed much of her perfect\n> body. Pausing at the Cogitor's life-support case, Zufa Cenva peered\n> inside at the enlarged brain. Her brow furrowed as she concentrated,\n> and as she did so, the brain itself seemed to vibrate; the\n> electrafluid swirled, bubbles formed. Alarmed, the devout attendant\n> monk withdrew his hand from the liquid.\n>\n> The tall woman relaxed, satisfied, and stepped to the podium. \"Because\n> of oddities in our environment, many of the females born on Rossak\n> exhibit enhanced telepathic abilities.\" Indeed, the powerful\n> Sorceresses of the dense, barely habitable jungles had parlayed their\n> mental quirks into political influence. Rossak men exhibited no such\n> telepathic enhancements.\n>\n> \"The League of Nobles was formed a thousand years ago for our mutual\n> defense, first against the Titans and then against Omnius. Since then,\n> we have barricaded ourselves, trying to protect our worlds from the\n> enemy.\" Her eyes flashed like highly polished stones. \"We need to\n> rethink this strategy. Perhaps it is time for *us* to take the\n> offensive against the Synchronized Worlds. Otherwise, Omnius and his\n> minions will never leave us alone.\"\n>\n> The League representatives muttered at this, looking fearful,\n> especially after the devastation Zimia had just endured. The Viceroy\n> was first to respond. \"That is a bit premature, Madame Cenva. I'm not\n> sure we have the capability.\"\n>\n> \"We barely survived the last attack!\" a man shouted. \"And we had only\n> a handful of cymeks to contend with.\"\n>\n> Manion Butler looked deeply concerned. \"Confronting Omnius would be a\n> suicide mission. What weapons would we use?\"\n>\n> In response, the imposing woman squared her shoulders and spread her\n> hands, while closing her eyes and concentrating. Although Zufa was\n> known to have extrasensory powers, she had never before displayed them\n> in Parliament. Her milky pale skin seemed to heat up with an inner\n> light. The air in the enclosed chamber stirred, and static electricity\n> crackled around the assemblage, making hair stand on end.\n>\n> Lightning flickered at her fingertips, as if she were holding a barely\n> contained thunderstorm inside herself. Her own white hair coiled and\n> writhed like snakes. When Zufa's eyes opened again, a dazzling energy\n> seemed ready to shoot out of them, as if the universe lived behind her\n> pupils.\n>\n> Gasps echoed through the delegates. Serena's skin crawled and her\n> scalp tingled, as if a thousand poisonous spiders skittered over her\n> mind. In her preservation tank, the Cogitor Kwyna churned.\n>\n> Then Zufa relaxed, throttling back the chain reaction of mental\n> energy. Letting out a long, cold breath, the Sorceress smiled grimly\n> at the startled onlookers. \"*We* have a weapon.\"\n>\n> *The eyes of common perception do not see far. Too often we make the\n> most important decisions based only on superficial information.*\n>\n> --- NORMA CENVA,\n\nunpublished laboratory notebooks\n\n> **A**fter delivering her announcement to the League assembly, Zufa\n> Cenva returned to Rossak. She had been in transit for weeks, and her\n> shuttle now landed on a dense section of the jungle canopy that had\n> been paved over with a polymer to seal and fuse the branches and\n> leaves into a solid mass. To enable the trees to receive adequate\n> moisture and gas exchange, the polymer was porous, synthesized from\n> jungle chemicals and organics.\n>\n> Toxic oceans made the native Rossak planktons, fish, kelp, and sea\n> creatures poisonous to humans. Rugged, sterile lava plains covered\n> much of the planet's land area, dotted with geysers and brimstone\n> lakes. Since the botanical chemistry did not rely on chlorophyll, the\n> general cast of all plants was silvery purple; nothing here was fresh\n> and green.\n>\n> In a tectonically stable zone girdling the equator, large rifts in the\n> continental plate created broad sanctuary valleys where the water was\n> filtered and the air breathable. In these protected rift ecosystems,\n> hardy human settlers had constructed sophisticated cave-cities like\n> hives tunneled into the black cliffs. The declivitous external walls\n> were overgrown with silvery-purple vines, drooping ferns, and fleshy\n> moss. Comfortable chambers looked out upon a thick jungle canopy that\n> pressed against the settlement cliffs. People could venture directly\n> onto the upper rubbery branches and descend to the dense underbrush,\n> where they harvested edibles.\n>\n> As if to make up for the dearth of life elsewhere on Rossak, the rift\n> valleys teemed with aggressive living things--- mushrooms, lichens,\n> berries, flowers, orchidlike parasites, and insects. The Rossak men,\n> lacking the telepathic enhancement of their women, had turned their\n> talents to developing and extracting drugs, pharmaceuticals, and\n> occasional poisons\n>\n> from nature's larder. The entire place was like a Pandora's box that\n> had been opened only a crack. . . .\n>\n> Now the tall, luminous Sorceress watched as her much younger paramour,\n> Aurelius Venport, crossed a suspended bridge from the open cliffs to\n> the foamy purple treetops. His patrician features were handsome, his\n> dark hair curly, his face long and lean. Tagging along behind him on\n> stubby legs came Zufa's disappointing fifteen-year-old daughter by a\n> prior relationship.\n>\n> *Two misfits. No wonder they get along so well*.\n>\n> Prior to seducing Aurelius Venport, the chief Sorceress had arranged\n> conjugal relationships with four other men during her peak breeding\n> times, selecting them for their proven bloodlines. After generations\n> of research, miserable miscarriages, and defective offspring, the\n> women of Rossak had compiled detailed genetic indices of various\n> families. Because of heavy environmental toxins and teratogens, the\n> odds were against any child being born strong and healthy. But for\n> every stillborn monster or talentless male, a miraculous pale-skinned\n> Sorceress might occur. Each time a woman conceived a child, it was\n> like playing a game of roulette. Genetics was never an exact science.\n>\n> But Zufa had been so careful, checking and double-checking the\n> bloodlines. Only one of those conjugal encounters had resulted in a\n> living child--- Norma, a dwarf barely four feet tall, with blocky\n> features, mousy brown hair, and a tedious, bookish personality.\n>\n> Many offspring on Rossak had defective bodies, and even the apparently\n> healthy ones rarely exhibited the strong mental powers of the elite\n> Sorceresses. Nevertheless, Zufa felt deep disappointment, even\n> embarrassment, that *her* daughter had no telepathic skills. The\n> greatest living Sorceress should have been able to pass along her\n> superior mental abilities, and she desperately wanted her daughter to\n> carry on the fight against the machines. But Norma showed no potential\n> whatsoever. And despite Aurelius Venport's impeccable genetic\n> credentials, Zufa had never been able to carry one of his babies to\n> term.\n>\n> *How many more times must I keep trying before I replace him with\n> another breeder?* Once more, she decided--- she would attempt to get\n> pregnant again, within the next few months. It would be Venport's last\n> chance.\n>\n> Zufa was also disappointed in Norma's independence and defiance. Too\n> often the teenager spun off on obscure mathematical tangents that no\n> one could comprehend. Norma seemed lost in her own world.\n>\n> *My daughter, you should have been so much more!*\n>\n> No one had a heavier burden of responsibility than the small clan of\n> Sorceresses on the planet, and Zufa's burden was the greatest of all.\n> If only she could count on everyone else, especially in light of this\n> latest danger from the cymeks.\n>\n> Since stunted Norma could never take part in the mental battle, Zufa\n> had to concentrate on her daughters in spirit, those few young women\n> who had won the \"genetic lottery\" and acquired superior mental\n> abilities. Zufa would train and encourage them, showing them how to\n> eradicate the enemy.\n>\n> From her cliffside perch, she watched her lover Aurelius and young\n> Norma reach the other side of the suspension bridge and begin to\n> negotiate a circular network of ladders that led to the deeply\n> shadowed jungle floor. Like two happy-go-lucky outcasts, Norma and\n> Aurelius had grown close emotionally, using one another as crutches.\n>\n> Engrossed in their own petty concerns that had nothing to do with\n> victory, neither of them had even noticed Zufa's return on the\n> shuttle. No doubt the two misfits would spend hours poking through the\n> foliage in search of new drug resources, which Aurelius would\n> incorporate into his business ventures.\n>\n> The Sorceress shook her head, not understanding his priorities. Those\n> drugs the men developed were of little more use than Norma's arcane\n> mathematics. Admittedly, Aurelius was a highly intelligent and skilled\n> businessman, but what good were enormous profits if free humanity was\n> doomed to enslavement?\n>\n> Disappointed in both of them, knowing that she and her Sorceresses\n> would have to do the real fighting, Zufa set out to find the most\n> powerful young women she had recruited to learn the devastating new\n> technique she planned to unleash against the cymeks.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AS NORMA FOLLOWED him through the fleshy underbrush, Aurelius consumed\n> capsules of a focused stimulant that his expert chemists had\n> synthesized from the pungent pheromones of a boulder-sized burrowing\n> beetle. Venport felt stronger, his perceptions sharpened, his reflexes\n> enhanced. Not quite like the telepathic powers of icy Zufa, but better\n> than his natural abilities.\n>\n> Someday he would make a breakthrough, allowing him to meet the\n> powerful Sorceress on his own terms. Maybe he and Norma would do it\n> together.\n>\n> Aurelius maintained a benign fondness for the girl's stern mother. He\n> tolerated Zufa's moods and scornful attitude with good grace; Rossak\n> women rarely allowed themselves the luxury of romantic love.\n>\n> Though Aurelius knew full well that Zufa had selected him for his\n> breeding potential, he saw through the woman's stoic, demanding\n> exterior. Attempting to conceal her weaknesses, the powerful Sorceress\n> showed her doubts on occasion, afraid that she could not fulfill the\n> responsibilities she had placed on herself. Once, when Aurelius\n> commented that he knew how strong she was trying to be, Zufa had grown\n> embarrassed and angry. \"Somebody has to be strong\" was all she had\n> said.\n>\n> Since he lacked telepathic ability, Zufa had little interest in\n> engaging him in conversation. Perhaps she recognized his skills as a\n> businessman, investor, and politician, but she valued none of those\n> abilities as much as her own narrow goals. The Sorceress frequently\n> tried to make him feel like a failure, but her derision only served to\n> ignite his ambition, especially his desire to find a drug that would\n> give him telepathic powers equivalent to her own.\n>\n> There were other ways to fight a war.\n>\n> The silvery-purple jungles offered a treasure-trove to cure diseases,\n> expand the mind, and improve human abilities. The choices were\n> overwhelming, but Aurelius sought to investigate everything. From\n> proper development and marketing, the products of Rossak had already\n> put him on the path to great wealth. He was even grudgingly respected\n> by a number of the Sorceresses--- except by his own mate.\n>\n> As a visionary entrepreneur, he was accustomed to exploring\n> alternatives. Like paths through a dense jungle, many routes could\n> lead to the same place. Sometimes, one just had to hack through with a\n> machete.\n>\n> So far, though, the right drug eluded him.\n>\n> In another venture, he had proudly distributed Norma's exotic\n> mathematical work among scholarly scientific circles. Though he didn't\n> understand her theorems, he had a gut feeling that she might come up\n> with something important. Maybe she had already done so, and it took\n> expert eyes to recognize it. Venport liked the intense girl, acting as\n> a big brother to her. As far as he was concerned, Norma was a\n> mathematical prodigy, so who cared about her height or her appearance?\n> He was willing to give her a chance, even if her mother never would.\n>\n> Beside him, Norma studied the design of a broad purple leaf, using a\n> light-beam caliper to measure its various dimensions and the\n> relationships among angles in the sap-filled veins. The depth of her\n> concentration added a wistful cast to her plain features.\n>\n> Glancing back at him, Norma said in a surprisingly mature voice, \"This\n> leaf has been designed and constructed by the Earth mother Gaia, or\n> the Master Creator God, or Buddallah, or whatever you want to call\n> it.\" With blunt fingers, she held up the fleshy leaf and passed a beam\n> of light through it, so that the intricate cellular designs showed\n> clearly. \"Patterns within patterns, all tied together in complex\n> relationships.\"\n>\n> In his drug-enhanced, euphoric state, Aurelius found the design\n> hypnotic. \"God is in everything,\" he said. The stimulant he had taken\n> seemed to supercharge his synapses. He squinted through the\n> illuminated fabric of the leaf as she pointed to the internal shapes.\n>\n> \"God is the mathematician of the universe. There is an ancient\n> correlation known as the Golden Mean, a pleasing ratio of form and\n> structure that is found in this leaf, in seashells, and in the living\n> creatures of many planets. It is the tiniest part of the key, known\n> since the time of the Greeks and Egyptians of Earth. They used it in\n> their architecture and pyramids, in their Pythagorean pentagram and\n> Fibonacci sequence.\" She discarded the leaf. \"But there is so much\n> more.\"\n>\n> Nodding, Venport touched a moistened fingertip to a pouch of fine\n> black powder at his belt; he rubbed the powder under the sensitive\n> tissue of his tongue and felt another drug penetrating his senses,\n> merging with the remnants of the last one. Norma kept talking; though\n> he did not follow her logical development, he was certain the\n> revelations must be fabulous.\n>\n> \"Give me a practical example,\" he slurred. \"Something with a function\n> that I can understand.\"\n>\n> He had grown accustomed to Norma spouting off obscure formulations.\n> Her basis might have been in classical geometry, but she applied her\n> knowledge in much more complex ways. \"I can envision calculations all\n> the way to infinity,\" she said, as if in a trance. \"I don't have to\n> write them down.\"\n>\n> *And she doesn't even need mind-enhancement drugs to accomplish it,*\n> Aurelius marveled.\n>\n> \"At this very moment I envision a huge and efficient structure that\n> could be built at a reasonable cost, tens of kilometers long--- and\n> based upon the ratio of the Golden Mean.\"\n>\n> \"But who would ever need something so immense?\"\n>\n> \"I cannot peer into the future, Aurelius.\" Norma teased him. Then they\n> trudged deeper into the weird jungle, still curious and intent on what\n> they might discover. Norma's face was radiant with energy. \"But there\n> might be something . . . something I haven't thought of yet.\"\n>\n> *Careful preparations and defenses can never guarantee* *victory.*\n>\n> *However, ignoring these precautions is an almost certain recipe for\n> defeat.*\n>\n> ---*League Armada Strategy Manual*\n>\n> **F**or four months, Tercero Xavier Harkonnen and his six Armada\n> survey vessels traveled along a predetermined route, stopping to\n> inspect and assess the military facilities and defensive preparations\n> of the League Worlds.

The Viceroy had praised him for his nerve\n> and determination; even so, Manion Butler had wisely sent the young\n> officer away during the major rebuilding activities, giving Salusans\n> time to heal their wounds without looking for a scapegoat.\n>\n> Xavier listened to no excuses from tightwad nobles unwilling to commit\n> the necessary resources. No expense must be spared. Any free world\n> that fell to machine aggression would be a loss for the entire human\n> race.\n>\n> The survey ships traveled from the mines of Hagal to the broad river\n> plains of Poritrin, then made their way to Seneca where the weather\n> was poor and the rain so corrosive that even thinking machines would\n> break down soon after a conquest.\n>\n> The League planets of Relicon followed, then Kirana III, then Richese,\n> with its burgeoning high-tech industries that made so many other\n> League noblemen uneasy. In theory, the sophisticated manufacturing\n> devices contained no computerization or artificial intelligence, but\n> there were always questions, always doubts.\n>\n> Finally Xavier's team arrived at their final inspection stop, Giedi\n> Prime. At last, his tour was about to end. He could return home, see\n> Serena again, and they could make good on their promises to each\n> other. . . .\n>\n> All other League Worlds had installed scrambler field towers. The\n> shields' known weakness against cymeks did not completely devalue\n> Holtzman's ingenious work, and the costly barriers still provided\n> substantial protection against all-out thinking machine offensives. In\n> addition, every human world had long ago built up enormous stockpiles\n> of atomics as part of a doomsday defense. With so many nuclear\n> warheads, an iron-willed planetary governor could turn his world into\n> slag rather than allowing it to fall to Omnius.\n>\n> Although the thinking machines also had access to atomics, Omnius had\n> concluded that atomics were an inefficient and nonselective way to\n> impose control, and radioactive cleanup afterward was difficult.\n> Besides, with unlimited resources and a deep reservoir of patience,\n> the relentless evermind had no need of such weapons.\n>\n> Now, as Xavier disembarked from the lead survey ship at the Giedi City\n> spaceport, he blinked under bright sunlight. The well-maintained\n> metropolis sprawled in front of him, with its habitation complexes and\n> productive industrial buildings amid manicured parks and canals. The\n> colors were bright and fresh, and flowers bloomed in ornate beds,\n> although with his new Tlulaxa lungs and tissues he could smell only a\n> hint of the most potent scents, even when he breathed deeply.\n>\n> \"This would be a fine place to bring Serena one day,\" he said\n> wistfully as he stood in the heat-shimmer of spaceship exhaust. If he\n> married her, perhaps this would be a suitable world for their\n> honeymoon. During the current inspection tour, he had kept his eyes\n> open, trying to find a likely spot.\n>\n> After four months in space, Xavier missed Serena terribly. He knew the\n> two of them were destined for each other. His life operated on a\n> smooth, clearly defined path. When he returned to Salusa, he promised\n> himself that he would formalize their betrothal. He saw no point in\n> waiting any longer.\n>\n> Viceroy Butler already treated him like a son, and the young officer\n> had received the blessing of his adoptive father Emil Tantor. As far\n> as Xavier\n>\n> could determine, everyone in the League agreed it would be a fine\n> joining of noble houses.\n>\n> He smiled, thinking of Serena's face, of her intriguing lavender eyes\n> . . . and then looked across the landing field to see Magnus Sumi\n> approaching the survey ships. The elected leader was accompanied by a\n> dozen members of the Giedi Prime Home Guard.\n>\n> The Magnus was a thin man in late middle age with pale skin and\n> gray-blond hair that hung to his shoulders. Sumi raised a hand. \"Ah,\n> Tercero Harkonnen! We welcome the League Armada and are eager to see\n> how Giedi Prime can improve its defenses against the thinking\n> machines.\"\n>\n> Xavier snapped a stiff bow in return. \"Your cooperation pleases me,\n> Eminence. Against Omnius, we must not use low-cost materials or\n> stopgap systems that would not adequately protect your people.\"\n>\n> After the Battle of Zimia, Xavier's corps of engineers had made\n> requests for mandatory strategic improvements throughout the League.\n> The nobles dug into their coffers, increasing taxes on their subjects\n> and spending the necessary money to build up their defenses. At each\n> stop, planet after planet, month after month, Xavier had assigned\n> teams of engineers and Armada troops where he deemed they were most\n> needed.\n>\n> Soon, though, he would be going back home. *Soon*. As the time drew\n> near, he thought of Serena more and more.\n>\n> Well dressed and well armed, the Home Guard stood at attention around\n> the survey ships. Magnus Sumi gestured for Xavier to follow him. \"I\n> look forward to clarifying everything over a sumptuous banquet,\n> Tercero Harkonnen. I've set up twelve fine courses with dancers,\n> musicians, and our best poets. You and I can relax in my government\n> residence while we discuss plans. I am certain you must be weary from\n> your journey. How long can you stay with us?\"\n>\n> Xavier could form only a tight smile, thinking of how far away he was\n> from Salusa Secundus. Even after leaving Giedi Prime, the ships would\n> still need\n>\n> another month of fast space travel to return home. The sooner he\n> departed here, the sooner he could hold Serena in his arms again.\n>\n> \"Eminence, this is the final stop on our long tour. If it pleases you,\n> I would prefer to spend less time with festivities and more on the\n> inspection.\" He gestured toward his survey ship. \"We have a schedule\n> to keep. I'm afraid I can allot only two days for Giedi Prime. It is\n> best that we concentrate on our work.\"\n>\n> The Magnus looked crestfallen. \"Yes, I suppose celebration is not\n> appropriate after the damage done to Salusa Secundus.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> FOR TWO DAYS, Xavier gave the planetary defenses a quick, almost\n> cursory inspection. He found Giedi Prime to be a dazzling and\n> prosperous world with many resources, perhaps even a suitable place to\n> settle down and start an estate of his own one day.\n>\n> He gave a favorable assessment, accompanied by a warning. \"This is\n> undoubtedly a planet the thinking machines will want to conquer,\n> Eminence.\" He studied the city blueprints and the distribution of\n> resources across the main continents. \"Any cymek attack would most\n> likely attempt to keep the industries intact so that robots could\n> exploit them. Omnius preaches efficiency.\"\n>\n> Beside him, Magnus Sumi reacted with pride. He pointed out substations\n> on the diagrams. \"We intend to install secondary field-transmitting\n> towers at several strategic points.\" As he spoke, highlights appeared\n> on the blueprint screen. \"We have already built a completely redundant\n> transmitting station on one of the uninhabited islands in the northern\n> sea, which can provide full overlap from a polar projection. We hope\n> to have it online within another month.\"\n>\n> Xavier nodded distractedly, his mind weary from months of such\n> details. \"I am glad to hear that, though I doubt a second transmitting\n> complex is entirely necessary.\"\n>\n> \"We want to feel safe, Tercero.\"\n>\n> When the two men stood under silvery parabolic towers that throbbed\n> into the sky over Giedi City, Xavier paced around the plascrete\n> embankments that blocked access to large vehicles. He had no doubt a\n> cymek warrior could easily crash through.\n>\n> \"Eminence, I suggest you station more ground troops and obstacles\n> here. Increase your planetside missile-defense batteries to protect\n> against any intrusion from space. On Salusa, the cymek strategy was to\n> focus their entire attack on the destruction of the towers, and they\n> might try that again.\" He rapped his knuckles against the tower's\n> heavy paristeel support pillar. \"These shields are your first and last\n> line of defense, your most effective blockade against thinking\n> machines. Do not neglect them.\"\n>\n> \"Indeed. Our munitions factories are building heavy artillery and\n> armored ground vehicles. As soon as possible, we intend to surround\n> this complex with a large concentration of military power.\"\n>\n> As for the uncompleted secondary generating station, it was too\n> isolated to be protected from a massive assault. But its existence\n> seemed to comfort the Magnus and his populace.\n>\n> \"Very good,\" Xavier said, then glanced at the chronometer on his\n> wrist. Everything was going so well, perhaps his survey ships could\n> depart before sunset. . . .\n>\n> The Magnus continued, his voice uncertain, \"Tercero, are you concerned\n> about Giedi Prime's limited space military defenses? Our Home Guard\n> has few large ships in orbit to drive back an approaching machine\n> fleet, and our picket ships and scouts are minimal. I admit to feeling\n> vulnerable in that area. What if Omnius attacks us directly from\n> orbit?\"\n>\n> \"You have ground-based missile defenses in place, and they have always\n> proved reliable.\" Impatient, Xavier looked up into the clear sky. \"I\n> believe your best hope is to protect your shield complex here on the\n> ground. No quantity of Armada battleships can match the deterrent\n> power of scrambler\n>\n> shields. When the robot fleet attacking Salusa realized they could not\n> take down the scramblers, they retreated.\"\n>\n> \"But what if they blockade Giedi Prime from orbit?\"\n>\n> \"Your world is self-sufficient enough to wait out any siege until the\n> arrival of a League rescue force.\" Anxious to be back at the\n> spaceport, Xavier decided to appease the governor. \"Nevertheless, I\n> will recommend that a javelin-class destroyer or two be stationed\n> around Giedi Prime.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THAT EVENING, THE Magnus threw a departure banquet for the Armada\n> service performed on his behalf. \"Someday,\" he said, \"we may all thank\n> you for our lives.\"\n>\n> Xavier excused himself midway through the meal. The food and wine\n> seemed to lack taste. \"My apologies, Eminence, but my squadron must\n> not miss the optimal departure window.\" He bowed at the doorway, then\n> hurried to his vessel. Some of his troops would have liked to remain\n> longer, but most were also eager to get home. They had their own\n> sweethearts and families, and these soldiers had more than earned\n> furloughs.\n>\n> With his inspection tour behind him, Xavier left lovely Giedi Prime,\n> confident that he had seen and done everything necessary.\n>\n> And completely unaware of the vulnerabilities he had not bothered to\n> discover. . . .\n>\n> *In the process of becoming slaves to machines, we transferred\n> technical knowledge to them--- without imparting proper value\n> systems.*\n\n--- PRIMERO FAYKAN BUTLER,\n\n*Memoirs of the Jihad*\n\n> **T**he *Dream Voyager* neared Earth, humanity's original home and now\n> the central Synchronized World.

When you weren't looking I recalibrated the alarm-sensor\n> setpoints.

I will keep trying--- and practicing.\"\n>\n> Vor realized that he might one day regret teaching Seurat that type of\n> humor.\n>\n> \"Incidentally, I have more than metal in my brain, as do all thinking\n> machines.

A circle has no end.\"\n>\n> \"Earth-Omnius is the beginning and the end.\"\n>\n> \"You're too literal. That's why I beat you in so many strategy games.\"\n>\n> \"Only forty-three percent of the time, young man,\" Seurat corrected.\n> He activated the exit ramp.\n>\n> \"Around half.\" Vorian headed toward the hatch, anxious to get outside\n> and breathe fresh air. \"Not bad for someone susceptible to illnesses,\n> distractions, physical weaknesses, and any number of other frailties.\n> I'm gaining ground on you, too, if you care to examine trends.\" He\n> bounded down to the sprawling field of fused plascrete.\n>\n> Loader robots scurried among larger pieces of AI equipment that moved\n> about on glider fields.

At the core of its\n> artificial body hung the protected brain jar that contained the mind\n> of an ancient human general.\n>\n> The cymek swiveled its turret sensors, as if targeting him, then\n> altered its path toward Vor, raising its front grappling arms. Heavy\n> pincers clacked.\n>\n> Vorian waved and rushed forward. \"Father!\"\n>\n> Since cymeks regularly exchanged temporary bodies in response to the\n> physical requirements of various activities, they were difficult to\n> distinguish from each other. However, Vor's father came to see him\n> whenever the *Dream Voyager* returned from its update-delivery\n> missions.\n>\n> Many enslaved humans lived on the Synchronized Worlds, serving the\n> evermind. Omnius kept them on as token workers, though few had lives\n> as important and comfortable as Vorian's. Trustees like himself\n> received special training, went through rigorous instruction at elite\n> schools for crew bosses and other important positions under the\n> machine domination.\n>\n> Vor had read about the glories of the Titans and knew the stories of\n> his father's great conquests. Raised under the evermind's wing and\n> trained by his cymek father, the young man had never questioned the\n> world order or his own loyalty to Omnius.\n>\n> Knowing the robot captain's moderate temperament, Agamemnon had used\n> considerable influence to obtain a spot for his son on Seurat's update\n> ship, an enviable assignment even among the chosen trustees.

The young man\n> stared fondly at the suspended brain case of his ancient father, with\n> its strange mechanical face now on the underside.\n>\n> \"Welcome back.\" Agamemnon's vocal patches made his voice deep and\n> paternal. \"Seurat has already uploaded his report. Once again, you\n> have made me proud. You are one step closer to meeting our goals.\" He\n> swiveled his turret around, reversing the direction of progress, and\n> Vorian trotted beside the armored legs as Agamemnon strode away from\n> the ship.\n>\n> \"If only my fragile body survives long enough to accomplish\n> everything,\" Vor said wistfully. \"I can't wait to be selected as a\n> neo-cymek.\"\n>\n> \"You are only twenty, Vorian. Too young to be morbidly concerned about\n> your mortality.\"\n>\n> Overhead, resource haulers dropped from orbit, balanced atop\n> yellow-white flames that slowed their descent. Loadcars manned by\n> human workers trundled up to where ships had landed, preparing to\n> distribute cargoes according to rigid instructions. Vor glanced at the\n> slaves but did not ponder their situation. Each person had his own\n> duties, every human and machine a cog in the Synchronized Worlds. But\n> Vor was superior to the others, since he had a chance to become like\n> his father one day. A cymek.\n>\n> They passed unmarked warehouses with computerized monitoring and\n> inventory systems where fuel and supplies were stored. Human clerical\n> personnel dispersed food and materials from storehouses to slaves\n> inside the city. Inspectors--- some robotic, some human--- performed\n> quality control and quantity assessments for the larger-scale plans of\n> Omnius.\n>\n> Vor could not comprehend the lives of the uneducated workers who\n> unloaded heavy crates at the space dock. The slave laborers performed\n> duties that a simple loading machine could have done faster and more\n> efficiently. But he was pleased that even these lesser people had\n> tasks they could perform in order to earn their subsistence.\n>\n> \"Seurat told me about Salusa Secundus, Father.\" He maintained a quick\n> pace to match the cymek's huge strides. \"I'm sorry your assault was\n> unsuccessful.\"\n>\n> \"Just a test case,\" Agamemnon said. \"The feral humans have a new\n> defensive system, and now we have probed it.\"\n>\n> Vor beamed. \"I'm sure you'll discover a way to bring all *hrethgir*\n> under the efficient rule of Omnius. Like the times described in your\n> memoirs, when Titans were in complete control.\"\n>\n> Inwardly, the cymek general frowned at the comments. Agamemnon's optic\n> threads detected numerous watcheyes floating around them as the two\n> walked. \"I do not wish for the old days, of course,\" he said,\n> presently. \"You have been reading my memoirs again?\"\n>\n> \"I never tire of your stories, Father. The Time of Titans, the great\n> Tlaloc, the First Hrethgir Rebellions . . . everything is so\n> fascinating.\" Accompanying the magnificent cymek made Vor feel\n> special. He always remained alert, within the limitations of his\n> position, for ways to better himself. He wanted to prove himself\n> worthy of the opportunities he'd been given . . . and of more. \"I\n> would be happy to learn of this new *hrethgir* defensive system,\n> Father. Perhaps I can assist you in finding a way to defeat it?\"\n>\n> \"Omnius is analyzing the data and will decide what to do. I have only\n> recently arrived back on Earth.\"\n>\n> With human ambitions still a fundamental part of their psyches, the\n> Titans always had monumental construction projects under way:\n> megalithic buildings and monuments to themselves that celebrated the\n> lost age of humanity and glorified the Time of Titans. Captive human\n> artists and\n>\n> architects were ordered to develop original designs and sketches that\n> the cymeks modified or approved.\n>\n> Nearby, machinery lifted the components of skyscraper buildings into\n> place, adding upper floors to existing complexes, though the thinking\n> machines had little need for further expansion. At times, the\n> extravagant construction seemed to Vor like mere busy-work for the\n> slaves. . . .\n>\n> He had never known his mother, and understood only that ages ago,\n> before the Titans had surgically converted themselves into cymeks,\n> Agamemnon had created his own sperm bank, from which he had germinated\n> Vorian. Over the centuries, the general could create any number of\n> offspring using acceptable surrogate mothers.\n>\n> Though he had never learned about any siblings, Vorian suspected they\n> were out there somewhere. He wondered what it would be like to meet\n> them, but in machine society, emotional attachments were not\n> practical. He only hoped that his siblings had not proven to be\n> disappointments to Agamemnon.\n>\n> When his father was off on his frequent missions, Vor often tried to\n> talk with the remaining Titans, curious about the events recorded in\n> Agamemnon's celebrated and voluminous memoirs. He used his responsible\n> position to better himself. Some of the original cymeks--- especially\n> Ajax--- were arrogant and treated Vor as a nuisance. Others, like Juno\n> or Barbarossa, found him amusing. All of them spoke with utmost\n> passion about Tlaloc, the first of the great Titans, who had sparked\n> the revolution.\n>\n> \"I wish I'd been able to meet Tlaloc,\" Vor said, trying to keep the\n> conversation going. Agamemnon loved to speak of his glory days.\n>\n> \"Yes, Tlaloc was a dreamer with ideas I had never heard before,\" the\n> cymek mused as he strode down the boulevards. \"At times he was a bit\n> na\u00efve, not always understanding the practical repercussions of his\n> ideas. But I pointed them out to him. That was why we made such a\n> great team.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon seemed to pick up speed when he spoke of the Titans. Weary\n> from trying to keep up the rapid pace, Vorian gasped for breath.\n>\n> \"Tlaloc took his name from an ancient rain god. Among the Titans,\n> Tlaloc was our visionary, while I was the military commander. Juno was\n> our tactician and manipulator. Dante watched over statistics,\n> bureaucracy, and population-accounting. Barbarossa saw to the\n> reprogramming of the thinking machines, making certain they had the\n> same goals as we did. He gave them ambition.\"\n>\n> \"And a good thing, too,\" Vorian said.\n>\n> Agamemnon hesitated, but did not voice any objections, wary of the\n> watcheyes. \"When he visited Earth, Tlaloc realized how the human race\n> had gone stagnant, how people had become so dependent on machines that\n> they had nothing left but apathy. Their goals were gone, their drive,\n> their passion. When they should have had nothing to do but unleash\n> their creative impulses, they were too lazy to perform even the work\n> of the imagination.\" His vocal speakers made a disgusted sound.\n>\n> \"But Tlaloc was different,\" Vor said, on cue.\n>\n> The cymek's voice took on more emotion. \"Tlaloc grew up in the Thalim\n> system, on an outer colony world where life was difficult, where labor\n> was not accomplished without sweat, blood, and blisters. He had to\n> fight his way and earn his position. On Earth, he saw that the human\n> spirit had all but died---*and the people hadn't even noticed!*\n>\n> \"He gave speeches attempting to rally the humans, to make them see\n> what was happening. A few watched him with interest, considering him a\n> novelty.\" Agamemnon raised one of his powerful metal arms. \"But they\n> heard his words only as a diversion. Soon the bored audiences returned\n> to their slothful, hedonistic pursuits.\"\n>\n> \"But not you, Father.\"\n>\n> \"I was dissatisfied with my uneventful life. I had already met Juno,\n> and the two of us had dreams. Tlaloc crystallized them for us. After\n> Juno and I joined him, we set in motion the events that led to the\n> downfall of the Old Empire.\"\n>\n> Father and son arrived at the central complex where the Earth-Omnius\n> resided, although redundant nodes of the evermind were distributed\n> around the planet in a network of armored vaults and high towers.\n> Vorian followed the cymek into the main structure, eager to do his\n> part. This was a ritual they had completed many times.\n>\n> The walker body strode through wide halls and entered a maintenance\n> facility filled with lubricant tubes, bubbling nutrient cylinders,\n> polished tabletops, and flickering analysis systems. Vor retrieved a\n> tool kit, then turned on vacuum hoses and high-pressure water jets,\n> found soft rags and polishing lotions. He considered it his most\n> important task as a trustee.\n>\n> In the center of the sterile room, Agamemnon halted beneath a lifting\n> apparatus. A magnetic claw-hand came down and attached itself to the\n> preservation canister that held his ancient brain. Neural connection\n> ports popped open, and thoughtrode cables spiraled away. The lifting\n> arm raised the canister, still attached to temporary batteries and\n> life-support systems.\n>\n> Vorian came forward with an armload of equipment. \"I know you can't\n> feel this, Father, but I like to think it makes you more comfortable\n> and efficient.\" He blasted the connection ports with high-pressure air\n> and streams of warm water, using a wadded cloth to polish every\n> surface. The cymek general transmitted wordless gratified murmurings.\n>\n> Vor completed the cleaning and polishing, then adjusted wires and\n> cables and hooked up diagnostics. \"All functions optimal, Father.\"\n>\n> \"With your attentive maintenance, it is no wonder. Thank you, my son.\n> You take such good care of me.\"\n>\n> \"It is my honor to do so.\"\n>\n> His synthesized voice purring, Agamemnon said, \"One day, Vorian, if\n> you continue serving me so well, I will recommend you for the greatest\n> reward. I will ask Omnius to surgically convert you into a cymek, like\n> me.\"\n>\n> At the mention of this wonderful prospect, Vorian again polished the\n> canister, then looked lovingly at the creamy contours of the brain\n> inside. He tried to hide his flush of eager embarrassment, but tears\n> came to his eyes. \"That is the best a human can hope for.\"\n>\n> *Humans, with such fragile physical forms, are easily crushed. Is it\n> any challenge to hurt or damage them?*\n\n--- ERASMUS,\n\nuncollated laboratory files\n\n> **G**azing out upon the skies of Earth again through hundreds of\n> appraising optic threads, Erasmus was not pleased. The robot stood in\n> a high bell tower of his villa, staring through a curving expanse of\n> armored windowplate. The landscape of this world, with its oceans and\n> forests and cities built upon the bones of other cities had already\n> seen countless civilizations rise and fall. The scope of history made\n> his own accomplishments seem small and contrived.\n>\n> Therefore, he would have to try harder.\n>\n> Neither Omnius nor any of his delegated architect robots understood\n> true beauty. To Erasmus, the buildings and the layout of the rebuilt\n> city resembled components with sharp angles, abrupt discontinuities. A\n> city must be more than an efficient circuit diagram. Under his\n> multiphased scrutiny, the metropolis looked like an elaborate\n> mechanism, designed and constructed with utilitarian force. It had its\n> own clean lines and systematic efficiency, which resulted in a\n> completely serendipitous beauty . . . but there was no finesse\n> whatsoever.\n>\n> It was such a disappointment when the omniscient evermind refused to\n> live up to his potential. Sometimes, gloriously unrealistic human\n> ambitions had a certain merit.\n>\n> Omnius either ignored or intentionally refuted the graceful beauty of\n> Golden Age human architecture. But such cold and petulant superiority\n> was not logical. Admittedly, Erasmus could see a certain beauty in\n> streamlined machines and components--- he rather liked his own\n> burnished platinum skinfilm, the smooth grace of his mirrored face\n> with which he formed facial\n>\n> expressions. But he saw no point in maintaining ugliness just to spite\n> a perceived enemy's concept of beauty.\n>\n> How could a vast computer mind distributed across hundreds of planets\n> exhibit even a hint of narrow-mindedness? To Erasmus, with his\n> detached and mature understanding developed through long\n> contemplation, Omnius's attitude revealed a lack of comprehensive\n> thinking.\n>\n> Making the sound of an exaggerated sigh that he had copied from\n> humans, he transmitted a thought-command that caused projection shades\n> to drop over the windows in the bell tower. Choosing his mood, he\n> projected artificial, pastoral views from other worlds. So soothing\n> and peaceful.\n>\n> On one wall he paused at a clothing synthesizer, selected the design\n> he wanted, and waited while a garment was prepared for him. A\n> traditional painter's smock. When it was ready, he draped it over his\n> sleek body and crossed the room to an easel where he had already set\n> up a blank canvas, a palette of paints, and fine brushes.\n>\n> At a wave of his hand, the projection shades shifted to display\n> enlarged images of masterpiece paintings, each one highlighting a\n> different great master. He selected \"Cottages at Cordeville\" by an\n> ancient Earth artist, Vincent Van Gogh. It was bold and colorful but\n> basically crude in its implementation, with inept lines and childish\n> pigment applications that featured thick globs of paint and smears of\n> color. Yet when considered as a whole, the painting itself possessed a\n> certain raw energy, an indefinable primitive vibrancy.\n>\n> After deep concentration, Erasmus thought he had a delicate\n> understanding of Van Gogh's technique. But the comprehension of *why*\n> anyone would want to create it in the first place eluded him.\n>\n> Although he had never painted before, he copied the artwork exactly.\n>\n> Brushstroke for brushstroke, pigment for pigment. When he was\n> finished,\n>\n> Erasmus examined his masterpiece. \"There, the sincerest form of\n> flattery.\"\n>\n> The nearest wall-mounted screen brightened to a pale gray wash of\n> light. Omnius had been watching, as always. Erasmus would no doubt\n> have to justify his activities, since the evermind would never\n> understand what the independent robot was doing.\n>\n> He studied the painting again. Why was it so hard to understand\n> creativity? Should he just change some of the components at random and\n> call it an original work? As the robot finished his scrutiny,\n> satisfied that he had made no mistakes, that he had not deviated from\n> the tolerances he could see in the image of the painting, Erasmus\n> waited for a rush of comprehension.\n>\n> Slowly, he came to realize that what he had just completed was not\n> really *art*, any more than a printing press created literature. He\n> had only *copied* the ancient composition in every detail. He had\n> added nothing, synthesized no newness. And he burned with the need to\n> understand the difference.\n>\n> Frustrated, Erasmus took a different tack. In an implacable voice, he\n> summoned three servants and ordered them to carry his painting\n> supplies out to one of the laboratory buildings. \"I intend to create a\n> new work of art, all my own. A still life, of sorts. You three will be\n> vital parts of the process. Rejoice in your good fortune.\"\n>\n> In the sterile environment of the laboratory, with the cold assistance\n> of his personal robot guards, Erasmus proceeded to vivisect the trio\n> of victims, oblivious to their screams. \"I want to get to the heart of\n> the matter,\" he quipped, \"the lifeblood of it.\"\n>\n> With stained metal hands he studied the dripping organs, squeezed\n> them, watched their juices flow and cellular structures collapse. He\n> performed a cursory analysis, discovering sloppy mechanics and\n> inefficient circulatory systems that were unnecessarily complex and\n> prone to failure.\n>\n> Then, feeling a vibrant energy, an *impulsiveness*, Erasmus set up a\n> tableau to paint. A new work, completely unique! It would be his own\n> arrangement, and he would tint the images using different filters,\n> making a few intentional mistakes to better approximate human\n> imperfection and uncertainty.\n>\n> At last, he must be on the right track.\n>\n> At his command, the sentinel robots brought in a vat filled with\n> fresh, uncoagulated human blood. Erasmus began removing the\n> interesting array of human organs--- still warm to the touch--- from\n> his table, and instructed two cleaning drones to scrape out the\n> insides from the donor bodies. Contemplating the arrangement and\n> order, he dropped organ after organ into the blood and watched them\n> bob in the liquid--- eyes, livers, kidneys, hearts.\n>\n> Slowly assessing each step of the process, he set up exactly what his\n> \"creative urges\" told him to do. Whim upon whim. Erasmus added more\n> ingredients to the grisly stew. Pursuant to something he had learned\n> about the artist Van Gogh, he sliced an ear off one of the corpses and\n> tossed it into the vat as well.\n>\n> Finally, his metal hands dripping gore, he stepped back. A beautiful\n> arrangement--- one that was totally original to him. He could think of\n> no famous human artist who had worked on such a canvas. No one else\n> had ever done anything approaching this.\n>\n> Erasmus wiped his smooth metallic hands and began to paint upon a\n> virgin canvas. On the blank medium, he astutely drew one of the three\n> hearts, showing in perfect detail the ventricals, auricles, and aorta.\n> But this was not meant to be a realistic dissection image.\n> Dissatisfied, he smeared some of the lines to add an artistic flair.\n> True art required the right amount of uncertainty, just as gourmet\n> cooking needed the proper spices and flavors.\n>\n> This must be how creativity worked. As he painted, Erasmus tried to\n> imagine the kinesthetic relationship between his brain and his\n> mechanical fingers, the thought impulses that set the fingers into\n> motion.\n>\n> \"Is *that* what the humans define as art?\" Omnius said from a\n> wallscreen.\n>\n> For once, Erasmus did not debate with the evermind. Omnius was correct\n> in his skepticism. Erasmus had not attained true creativity. Yes, he\n> had produced an original and graphic arrangement. But in human\n> artwork, the\n>\n> sum of the components added up to more than the individual items. Just\n> ripping organs from victims, floating them in blood, and painting them\n> brought him no closer to understanding human inspiration. Even if he\n> manipulated the details, he remained imprecise and uninspired.\n>\n> Still, this might be a step in the right direction.\n>\n> Erasmus could not carry this thought to the next logical step, and he\n> came to understand why. The process was not ratiocinative at all.\n> Creativity and the precision of analysis were mutually exclusive.\n>\n> Frustrated, the robot gripped the macabre painting in his powerful\n> hands, broke the frame, and tore the canvas to shreds. He would have\n> to do better than this, much better. Erasmus shifted his metallic\n> polymer face to a stylized pensive mask. He was no closer to\n> comprehending humans, despite a century of intensive research and\n> musings.\n>\n> Walking slowly, Erasmus went to his private sanctuary, a botanical\n> garden where he listened to classical music piped through the cellular\n> structures of plants. \"Rhapsody in Blue,\" by a composer of Old Earth.\n>\n> In the contemplative garden, the troubled robot sat in the ruddy\n> sunlight and felt warmth on his metal skin. This was another thing\n> that humans seemed to enjoy, but he did not understand why. Even with\n> his sensory enhancement module, it just seemed like *heat*.\n>\n> And machines that overheated broke down.\n>\n> *The tapestry of the universe is vast and complex, with infinite\n> patterns. While threads of tragedy may form the primary weave,\n> humanity with its undaunted optimism still manages to embroider small\n> designs of happiness and love.*\n>\n> --- COGITOR KWYNA,\n\nCity of Introspection archives\n\n> **A**fter his long sojourn in space, Xavier could think only of being\n> home, and back in the warm embrace of Serena Butler.\n>\n> On furlough, he returned to the Tantor estate where he was welcomed by\n> his adoptive parents and their enthusiastic son Vergyl. The Tantors\n> were a soft-spoken older couple, gentle and intelligent, with dark\n> skin and hair the color of thick smoke. Xavier seemed to be cut from\n> the same mold, with similar interests and high moral values. He had\n> grown up in this warm and spacious manor house, which he still\n> considered home. Though he had legally inherited other Harkonnen\n> holdings--- mining and industrial operations on three planets--- many\n> rooms in the Tantor mansion were still set aside for his use.\n>\n> As he entered his familiar large suite, Xavier found a pair of shaggy\n> gray wolfhounds awaiting him, wagging their tails. He dropped his bags\n> and wrestled with the dogs. The animals, larger than his little\n> brother, were always playful and delighted to see him.\n>\n> That evening, the family feasted on the cook's specialty of sage fowl\n> roasted with honey, slivered nuts, and olives from the Tantors' own\n> groves. Unfortunately, after his exposure to the cymeks' searing gas,\n> the subtle nuances of flavors and aromas now eluded him. The cook gave\n> him an alarmed look when he dumped salt and seasoning--- which he\n> needed to taste anything at all--- onto the delicate food.\n>\n> Another thing the thinking machines had taken from him.\n>\n> Afterward, Xavier lounged in a heavy oak chair before a roaring fire,\n> sipping a red wine from the Tantor family vineyards--- also,\n> unfortunately, nearly tasteless. He luxuriated in relaxing at home,\n> away from military protocol. He had spent almost half a year aboard\n> the efficient but bare-bones Armada survey ships; tonight he would\n> sleep like a babe in his own bedchamber.\n>\n> One of the gray wolfhounds snored loudly, resting a furry muzzle on\n> Xavier's stockinged feet. Emil Tantor, with a fringe of smoky hair\n> around his bald crown, sat in the chair opposite his adopted son. Emil\n> asked about the strategic positions of the Synchronized Worlds and the\n> military capabilities of the Armada. \"What are the chances of the war\n> escalating after the attack on Zimia? Can we ever do more than drive\n> them back?\"\n>\n> Xavier finished his wine, poured another half glass for himself and a\n> full one for the older man, then sat back in the chair again, all\n> without disturbing the gray dog. \"The situation looks grim, Father.\"\n> Barely remembering his own parents, he had always called the Tantor\n> lord his father. \"But, then, it has always looked grim, ever since the\n> Time of Titans. Perhaps we lived too comfortably in the days of the\n> Old Empire. We forgot how to be ourselves, how to live up to our\n> potential, and for a thousand years afterward we've paid the price. We\n> were easy prey--- first for evil men, then for soulless machines.\"\n>\n> Emil Tantor sipped his wine, and stared into the fireplace. \"So is\n> there hope, at least? We must have something to cling to.\"\n>\n> Xavier's lips formed a gentle smile. \"We are human, Father. As long as\n> we hold onto that, there is always hope.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THE NEXT DAY Xavier sent a message to the Butler estate, asking\n> permission to accompany the Viceroy's daughter on the annual\n> bristleback hunt, scheduled in two days. Serena would already know\n> that Xavier had returned. His survey ships had arrived with much\n> fanfare, and Manion Butler would have been expecting his note.\n>\n> Still, Salusan society was formal and extravagant. In order to court\n> the beautiful daughter of the Viceroy, one had to bow to certain\n> expectations.\n>\n> In late morning a messenger pounded on the doors of the Tantor manor\n> house; Vergyl stood beside his big brother, grinning when he saw the\n> expression on Xavier's face. \"What is it? Can I come along? Did the\n> Viceroy say yes?\"\n>\n> Xavier made a mock-stern expression. \"How could he possibly turn down\n> the man who saved Salusa Secundus from the cymeks? Remember that,\n> Vergyl, if you ever wish to win the affections of a young lady.\"\n>\n> \"I need to save a *planet* just to have a girlfriend?\" The boy sounded\n> skeptical, though wary of outright disbelief when it came to Xavier's\n> words.\n>\n> \"For a woman as magnificent as Serena, that is exactly what you must\n> do.\" He strode into the great house to tell the Tantors his plans.\n>\n> The next dawn, Xavier dressed in his finest equestrian outfit and rode\n> into brightening daylight toward the Butler property. He borrowed his\n> father's chocolate-brown Salusan stallion, a fine beast with a braided\n> mane, narrow muzzle, and bright eyes. The animal's ears were large,\n> and its gait flowed without the jarring rhythm of less conditioned\n> horses. On the crest of a grassy hill stood a cluster of ornate\n> whitewashed buildings--- a main house, stables, servants' quarters,\n> and storage sheds arranged as outbuildings along the perimeter of a\n> split-rail fence. As his horse climbed, he saw impressive vistas of\n> the white spires of Zimia far behind him.\n>\n> A path paved with crushed limestone wound up to the crest. The gravel\n> crunched under the stallion's hooves as Xavier rode, breathing the\n> crisp air. He could feel the moist chill of early spring, saw fresh\n> leaves on the trees, a dazzle of wildflowers in their first bloom. But\n> each breath he drew into his new lungs smelled flat.\n>\n> Grapevines lined the hill like green corduroy, carefully tended and\n> watered, each vine tied to cables between stakes so that the clusters\n> would hang off the ground for easy picking. Twisted olive trees\n> surrounded the main house,\n>\n> their low branches awash with white flowers. Each year, the first\n> pressings of grapes and olives were cause for feasting in every\n> Salusan household; local vineyards vied against each other to see\n> which could produce the best vintages.\n>\n> As Xavier rode through the gates and into the courtyard, other\n> horsemen in hunting outfits milled about. Barking dogs dodged around\n> the stallion's legs, but the chocolate-brown horse stood majestically,\n> ignoring the hounds as if they were ill-mannered little boys.\n>\n> Contract huntsmen grabbed the leashes and pulled the dogs back into\n> order. A number of short black hunting horses pranced about, as\n> impatient as the dogs. Two of the huntsmen whistled loudly and others\n> joined them, ready to begin the day's festivities.\n>\n> Manion Butler strolled out of the stables, calling up his team like a\n> military commander positioning troops for battle. He glanced at the\n> young officer, raised a hand in greeting.\n>\n> Then Xavier saw Serena riding out on a gray mare with beautiful lines\n> and an ornate saddle. She wore high boots, jodhpurs, and a black\n> riding jacket. Her eyes were like electric sparks as her gaze met his.\n>\n> She cantered over to where Xavier sat astride his mount, a smile\n> forming at the edges of her mouth. Even with all the barking dogs,\n> restless horses, and shouting huntsmen, Xavier wanted to kiss her so\n> badly that he could barely restrain himself. Yet Serena remained\n> coolly formal, extending a gloved hand in greeting. He took it,\n> holding her fingertips.\n>\n> How he wished he could be telepathic like the Sorceresses of Rossak,\n> just to send her his thoughts. But from the obvious delight suffusing\n> her face, he thought Serena understood his feelings well enough, and\n> reciprocated them.\n>\n> \"The journeys across space were so long,\" he said. \"And I thought\n> about you all the time.\"\n>\n> \"*All* the time? You should have been concentrating on your duties.\"\n> She gave him a skeptical smile. \"Perhaps we can find time alone during\n> today's hunt, and you will tell me what you dreamed of.\"\n>\n> Playfully, she urged her gray mare to trot over to where her father\n> waited. Conscious of the eyes watching them, she and Xavier maintained\n> an acceptable distance. He rode forward and clasped her father's\n> black-gloved hand. \"I thank you for allowing me to participate in the\n> hunt, Viceroy.\"\n>\n> Manion Butler's florid face rearranged itself into a grin. \"I'm glad\n> you could join us, Tercero Harkonnen. This year I'm certain we'll\n> track down a bristleback. The beasts are definitely in these woods---\n> and I, for one, have been craving hams and roasts. And bristlebacon,\n> especially. There's nothing like it.\"\n>\n> Her eyes dancing, Serena looked at him. \"Perhaps, Father, if you\n> brought along fewer barking dogs, galloping horses, and men crashing\n> through the underbrush, some of those shy animals would be easier to\n> find.\"\n>\n> In response, Manion smiled as if she were still a precocious little\n> girl. Glancing at Xavier, he said, \"I'm glad you'll be there to\n> protect her, young man.\"\n>\n> The Viceroy raised his right arm. Horns sounded and a brass gong\n> clanged from the stables. The purebred hounds began to bay, clustering\n> toward the far fence. Ahead, the path led beyond the blossoming olive\n> groves and into the scrubby Salusan forest. Two eager-eyed boys swung\n> open the gates, already anticipating their first bristleback hunt.\n>\n> The party rode out like a rowdy gang, dogs pushing first through the\n> gates, followed by the big horses that carried the professional\n> huntsmen. Manion Butler rode with them, blowing an antique bugle that\n> had been with his family since Bovko Manresa's first settlement on\n> Salusa.\n>\n> The followers rode lesser mounts, hurrying behind the horses. These\n> helper crews would set up camp and dress and skin whatever wild game\n> the\n>\n> huntsmen caught. They would also prepare the feast once the party\n> returned to the main house.\n>\n> The hunters had already spread out, with each chief taking a point and\n> plunging into the outskirts of the forest. Unhurried, Xavier and\n> Serena trotted toward the dark green woods. One bright-eyed young man,\n> trailing behind, glanced over his shoulder and winked at Xavier, as if\n> he knew that the young couple had no intention of enjoying the hunt\n> for its own sake.\n>\n> Xavier urged his stallion forward. Serena rode beside him, and they\n> chose their own path through thinning trees to a muddy streambed wet\n> with spring flow. Smiling secretively at each other, they listened to\n> the distant sounds of dogs and her father's continuing bugle blasts.\n>\n> The Butler's private forest covered hundreds of acres, crisscrossed by\n> game trails. Mostly it was left as a preserve, with meadows and\n> sparkling creeks, nesting birds, and lush patches of flowers that\n> bloomed in successive splashes of color as the patches of crusty snow\n> faded.\n>\n> Xavier was simply happy to be alone with Serena. Riding side by side,\n> they brushed arms and shoulders, intentionally. He would reach up to\n> hold green branches away from her face, and Serena pointed out birds\n> and small animals, identifying them.\n>\n> In his comfortable hunting outfit, Xavier carried a sheathed\n> ceremonial dagger, a bullwhip, and a Chandler pistol that shot\n> jacketed crystal fragments. Serena carried her own knife and a small\n> pistol. But neither of them expected to bring down any prey. To them,\n> their hunt was for each other, and both knew it.\n>\n> Serena chose her path without hesitation, as if she had spent time\n> during Xavier's survey mission riding through the forest in search of\n> places where they could be alone. Finally, she led him through a stand\n> of dark pines to a meadow with tall grasses, starlike flowers, and\n> thick reeds taller than her head. The reeds surrounded a mirror-smooth\n> pond, a shallow old tarn created by winter snow melt and refreshed by\n> an underground spring.\n>\n> \"The water has bubbles in it,\" she said. \"It tingles your skin.\"\n>\n> \"Does that mean you want to go for a swim?\" Xavier's throat tightened\n> at the prospect.\n>\n> \"It'll be cold, but the spring has some natural heat. I'm willing to\n> risk it.\" With a smile, Serena dismounted and let her mare graze. She\n> heard a splash out in the pond, but the reeds blocked their view.\n>\n> \"Sounds like a lot of fish, too,\" Xavier said. He slid down from his\n> stallion, patted the muscular neck, and let his mount sniff at the\n> thick grasses and flowers near the gray mare.\n>\n> Serena pulled off her riding boots and stockings, then lifted her\n> loose jodhpurs above her knees as she walked barefoot into the rushes.\n> \"I'm going to test the water.\" She pushed the hollow grasses aside.\n>\n> Xavier checked the fastenings on his stallion's saddle. He worked open\n> one of the leather compartments and brought out a bottle of fresh\n> citrus water to share. He followed Serena toward the reeds, already\n> imagining how it would be to swim beside her, just the two of them\n> stroking naked through this lonely forest lake, kissing each other. .\n> . .\n>\n> Without warning, a monstrous bristleback charged out of the reeds,\n> spraying mud and water from its cool wallowing hole. Serena let out a\n> cry, more of alarm than terror, and fell backward into the mud.\n>\n> The bristleback pawed at the rushes with its cloven hooves. Long tusks\n> protruded from a squarish snout, each a bony maul for uprooting\n> saplings and eviscerating enemies. The animal had wide-set eyes, large\n> and black. It made loud grunts as if preparing to breathe fire. In\n> tales of great bristleback hunts, many men, hunting dogs, and horses\n> had died--- but there were so few of the animals anymore.\n>\n> \"Into the water, Serena!\"\n>\n> The bristleback turned as it heard his shout. Serena did exactly as\n> Xavier said, splashing away from the rushes, deeper into the pond. She\n> began to swim, knowing the boar could not charge her if she was in\n> deep enough water.\n>\n> The bristleback stomped out of the rushes. The two horses squealed and\n> skittered back toward the edge of the meadow.\n>\n> \"Look out, Xavier!\" Waist deep now, Serena drew her hunting knife, but\n> knew she couldn't help him.\n>\n> Xavier planted his legs firmly, held a knife in one hand and the\n> Chandler pistol in the other. Without flinching, he aimed the\n> crystal-shard weapon and shot the bristleback three times in the face.\n> The sharp projectiles tore through the animal's cheek and forehead,\n> gouging the thick skull. Another shot splintered one of the tusks. But\n> the bristleback kept charging toward him, caught up in its own\n> solitary stampede.\n>\n> Xavier fired twice more. The mangled creature bled profusely, mortally\n> wounded--- but even imminent death did not diminish its momentum. As\n> the beast thundered toward him, Xavier jumped to one side and slashed\n> the sharp knife across its throat, opening jugular and carotid\n> vessels. The bristleback turned, gushing blood upon him even as its\n> heart began to fade.\n>\n> The weight of the falling creature knocked Xavier to the ground, but\n> he wrestled it away, avoiding the convulsive thrusts of the razor\n> tusks. The killing done, Xavier climbed back to his feet and staggered\n> away, shivering in shock. His hunting outfit was soaked with the\n> beast's blood.\n>\n> He sprinted into the trampled rushes at the edge of the water.\n> \"Serena!\" \"I'm all right,\" she called, splashing toward the shore.\n>\n> He looked at his reflection in the placid pond, saw his shirt and face\n> covered with gore. He hoped none of it was his own. He cupped his\n> hands and splashed cool water on his skin, then dunked his head to\n> wash the stink from his hair. He scrubbed his hands with peaty sand.\n>\n> Serena came to him, her clothes drenched, wet hair clinging to her\n> skull. She used a corner of her riding jacket to dab the blood from\n> his neck and cheeks. Then she opened his shirt, wiping his chest as\n> well.\n>\n> \"I don't have a scratch on me,\" he said, not sure if it was true. The\n> skin on one side of his neck felt raw and hot, as if chafed, and his\n> chest was sore from the collision with the attacker. He clutched her\n> arm, pulling her closer. \"Are you sure you're not hurt? You aren't\n> cut, no bones broken?\"\n>\n> \"You're asking me?\" she said with teasing disbelief. \"*I'm* not the\n> brave boar fighter here.\"\n>\n> Serena kissed him. Her lips were cold from the water, but he held them\n> against his own, awakening her touch with his until their mouths\n> opened slightly, their breath warm inside each other as the kiss\n> deepened. He took her from the edge of the pond, through the rushes,\n> and to the soft meadow grass, far from the dead bristleback.\n>\n> The young lovers stroked the wet hair away from their ears and eyes,\n> and kissed again. The brush with death made them feel intensely alive.\n> Xavier's skin was hot, and his heart kept pounding, even though the\n> danger was past. A new excitement mounted. He wished he could better\n> enjoy the seductive scent of her perfume, but could detect only a\n> tantalizing thread.\n>\n> Serena's sodden clothes were cold, and Xavier noticed goosebumps on\n> her pale arms. All he could think to do was to remove the wet fabric.\n> \"Here, let me warm you.\"\n>\n> She helped him unfasten the black riding jacket and her blouse while\n> her own fingers worked at his bloodstained shirt. \"Just to make\n> certain you're not hurt,\" Serena said. \"I don't know what I would have\n> done if you'd been killed.\" Her words came fast and hard between\n> kisses.\n>\n> \"It takes more than a wild boar to keep me away from you.\"\n>\n> She yanked his shirt down over his shoulders and fumbled with his cuff\n> so she could take it off entirely. The meadow was soft and lush. The\n> horses\n>\n> munched patiently on grasses as Xavier and Serena made love without\n> restraint, expressing their pent-up passions, whispering and then\n> shouting their love for each other.\n>\n> The rest of the hunting party seemed far away, even though Xavier had\n> killed a bristleback and would have a dramatic story to tell during\n> the evening's feast. Of course, certain details would need to be\n> omitted. . . .\n>\n> For the moment, the war with the thinking machines did not exist. In\n> this brief and heady hour, they were just two human beings, alone and\n> in love.\n>\n> *There is a certain hubris to science, a belief that the more we\n> develop technology and the more we learn, the better our lives will\n> be.*\n>\n> --- TLALOC,\n\n*A Time for Titans*\n\n> **A**nything imagined can be made real . . . given sufficient genius.\n>\n> Tio Holtzman had said as much in a hundred speeches at the Lords\n> Council on Poritrin. His concepts and achievements sparked dreams and\n> fostered confidence in human technological capabilities against the\n> thinking machines.\n>\n> The mantra had also been picked up by his patron, Lord Niko Bludd, and\n> by representatives in the League of Nobles. Early in his career,\n> Holtzman had realized that it was not always the best scientists who\n> received the accolades or funding. Instead, it was the best *showmen*,\n> the most effective politicians.\n>\n> To be sure, Savant Holtzman was an adequate scientist. He had an\n> exceptional technical background and had achieved marked success with\n> his inventions and weapons systems, all of which had been put to good\n> use against Omnius. But he had arranged for more publicity and\n> attention than the inventions themselves warranted. Through his\n> oratory skills and by coloring certain details, he had constructed a\n> pedestal of fame on which he now stood. Holtzman had made himself into\n> the Hero of Poritrin, rather than just another nameless inventor. His\n> ability to enchant audiences, to spark a sense of wonder and\n> possibility in their minds, exceeded his scientific skills.\n>\n> To maintain his mythology, Holtzman constantly hungered for new\n> *ideas*--- which required inspiration and long periods of\n> uninterrupted thought. He liked to let possibilities roll like pebbles\n> down a steep mountain slope. Sometimes the pebbles would come to rest,\n> making a bit of noise but\n>\n> ultimately yielding nothing; on other occasions, such notions might\n> spark an avalanche.\n>\n> *Anything imagined can be made real*.\n>\n> But first it must be imagined, seen in the vision of the creator.\n>\n> After returning home from the devastation on Salusa Secundus, he had\n> booked himself a private cabin aboard a luxurious driftbarge, one of\n> the quiet zeppelin craft that rose from the delta city of Starda and\n> drifted inland on currents of warm air, cruising across the seemingly\n> endless Poritrin plains.\n>\n> Holtzman stood on the driftbarge's open deck, looking at the\n> grasslands that flowed in a sea of green and brown, dappled with\n> lakes. Below him, birds flew like schools of fish. The slow aircraft\n> floated with no hurry, no schedule.\n>\n> He stared toward the open horizon. Limitless distances, endless\n> possibilities. Hypnotic, meditative . . . inspirational. Such places\n> opened his mind, allowed him to pursue crazy concepts and run them\n> down like a predator pursuing prey.\n>\n> The driftbarge passed over geometric shapes like tattoos on the\n> ground, carefully sectioned acreage for the labor-intensive farming of\n> sweet cane. Other fields grew plump grains and fibrous threads to make\n> Poritrin cloth. Armies of human slaves worked the farms and ranches\n> like insects from a hive.\n>\n> Following a bucolic derivative of Navachristianity, the people of\n> Poritrin had outlawed computerized harvesting apparatus and restored\n> their society to humbler roots. Without sophisticated machinery, they\n> required a great deal of manual labor. Long ago, Sajak Bludd had been\n> the first League nobleman to introduce actual slavery as a means of\n> making large-scale agriculture viable.\n>\n> That Poritrin lord had justified his act by choosing only those who\n> owed a debt to humanity, mostly Buddislamic cowards who had fled\n> instead of fighting against the repressive Titans and thinking\n> machines. If they hadn't been afraid to help defend humanity, Sajak\n> Bludd said, their added numbers might have been enough to turn the\n> tide of war. Working the fields was a small enough price for their\n> descendants to pay. . . .\n>\n> Holtzman paced the driftbarge's deck, acquired a fluted glass of\n> sugary juice from a server, and sipped it as he pondered. Looking down\n> at the sea of grasses, he relished his mental sojourn. No distractions\n> . . . but as yet no inspiration, either. The great scientist often\n> embarked on such journeys to pull his thoughts together, simply\n> staring and thinking--- and *working*, though everyone else aboard\n> seemed to be taking a holiday.\n>\n> Because of Holtzman's previous successes, Niko Bludd gave him free\n> reign to develop whatever innovative defenses and weapons struck his\n> fancy. Unfortunately, during the past year the scientist had faced a\n> growing conviction that he was running out of ideas.\n>\n> Genius was nothing without creative impulse. Of course, the Savant\n> could coast for a while on his earlier triumphs. Still, he had to\n> offer up new inventions regularly, or even Lord Bludd would begin to\n> doubt him.\n>\n> Holtzman could never permit that. It was a matter of pride.\n>\n> He'd been embarrassed that the cymeks so easily penetrated his\n> scrambler shields on Salusa Secundus. How could he--- and all the\n> other engineers and technicians on the project--- have ignored the\n> fact that cymeks had human minds, not AI gelcircuitry? It was a\n> significant, devastating lapse.\n\nStill, the outpouring of faith and hope--- not to mention substantial\nfunding\n\n> --- made him feel a crippling pressure. The people would never allow\n> him to retire now. He must find some other solution, save the day once\n> more.\n>\n> While back in the blufftop laboratories at his Starda residence, he\n> searched constantly, reading dissertations and theoretical papers\n> transmitted to him, combing them for exploitable possibilities. Many\n> of the reports were\n>\n> esoteric, beyond even his comprehension, but occasionally an idea\n> struck his fancy.\n>\n> Holtzman had brought along numerous recordings for this mental sojourn\n> over the Poritrin plains. One ambitious and intriguing paper had been\n> written by an unknown theorist from Rossak named Norma Cenva. She had\n> no credentials, as far as he could determine, but her concepts were\n> nothing short of amazing. She thought of simple things in a completely\n> different light. He had a gut feeling about her, an instinct. And she\n> had such a low profile. . . .\n>\n> As starlight fell over the vast bowl of Poritrin sky, he sat alone in\n> his cabin drinking a warm fruity beverage. He stared at Norma's\n> calculations, working them repeatedly in his mind, watchful for errors\n> while trying to understand.

Perhaps some of her concepts\n> might be applicable to devices he wanted to employ against the\n> thinking machines.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THAT AFTERNOON THE Savant wrote a personal invitation to Norma Cenva\n> and dispatched it to Rossak by League courier. This young woman\n>\n> who had grown up isolated in the jungles just might prove to be his\n> salvation . . . if he handled the situation properly.\n>\n> *Opportunities are a tricky crop, with tiny flowers that are difficult\n> to see and even more difficult to harvest.*\n>\n> --- ANONYMOUS\n>\n> **F**eeling like an intruder, Norma Cenva stood in her mother's study,\n> overlooking the canopied purple trees. A sour, misty rain fell\n> outside; some of the droplets from the high skies contained impurities\n> and poisonous chemicals from spewing volcanic fumes in the distance.\n> On the far horizon, she monitored dark clouds as they drew closer.\n> Soon there would be a downpour.\n>\n> What did Aurelius Venport want her to find in here?\n>\n> Her stern mother maintained an austere room with chalky-white interior\n> walls. An alcove contained the Sorceress's fine clothes, articles that\n> were much too large and fanciful for Norma to wear. Zufa Cenva had an\n> intimidating beauty, a luminous purity that made her as perfect--- and\n> as hard--- as a classic sculpture. Even without telepathic powers, she\n> could draw men like ants to honey.\n>\n> But the chief Sorceress had only a superficial loveliness, concealing\n> an implacability about subjects she never permitted Norma to see. It\n> wasn't that Zufa didn't trust her daughter; she simply considered the\n> girl beneath grand concerns. Like her telepathic companions, Zufa\n> seemed to thrive on secrecy.\n>\n> But Aurelius had seen something here. \"You won't be sorry if you find\n> it, Norma,\" he had told her, smiling. \"I trust your mother to tell you\n> about it eventually . . . but I don't believe it is high in her\n> priorities.\"\n>\n> *I have never been high in her priorities.* Curious, but wary of being\n> caught, Norma continued to investigate.\n>\n> Her gaze settled on a fibersheet notebook resting on a worktable. The\n> thick book had a maroon cover with indecipherable lettering as arcane\n> as the\n>\n> mathematical notations Norma had developed. Once, eavesdropping on the\n> Sorceresses and their intricate plans, Norma heard them refer to their\n> private language as \"Azhar.\"\n>\n> Since returning from Salusa Secundus, her mother had been even more\n> detached and aloof than usual. She seemed driven to attempt greater\n> things, because of the cymek attack. When Norma inquired about the war\n> effort, Zufa had merely frowned at her. \"We will take care of it.\"\n>\n> The chief Sorceress spent much of her time sequestered with a\n> cabalistic clique of women, whispering secret things. Zufa had a fresh\n> passion, a new idea to use against the thinking machines. If her\n> mother had dreamed of any way Norma could contribute, she would have\n> pressed the dwarf girl into service. Instead, Zufa had entirely\n> written off her daughter without giving her a chance.\n>\n> The most talented women, numbering around three hundred, had\n> established a security zone in the deep fungoid jungle, cutting off\n> the pharmaceutical scavengers hired by Aurelius Venport. Any explorer\n> who ventured into the secluded area encountered strange shimmering\n> barricades.\n>\n> Ever alert, Norma had noticed unexplained explosions and fires out\n> where Zufa's hand-picked Sorceresses spent weeks of intensive\n> training. Her mother rarely came back to her cliffside chambers. . . .\n>\n> Now, in her mother's room, Norma discovered two pieces of fine white\n> paper beneath the maroon notebook: the bleached parchment often used\n> by League couriers. This must be what Aurelius had wanted her to find.\n>\n> Dragging a stepstool to the table, she climbed up. She could see the\n> heading on the top sheet of parchment--- a formal document from\n> Poritrin. Curious, afraid her mother might return from the jungles,\n> she removed the pages and was astonished to read in black chancery\n> lettering, SAVANT TIO HOLTZMAN.\n>\n> For what possible purpose had the great inventor written a letter to\n> her mother? Leaning down, the girl read the salutation line: \"Dear\n> Norma\n>\n> Cenva.\" With a scowl, she scanned the message, then reread it with\n> mounting delight mixed with anger. *Tio Holtzman wants me to\n> apprentice with him on Poritrin! He thinks I am brilliant? I can't\n> believe it*.\n>\n> Her own mother had attempted to conceal, or at least delay, the\n> transmittal! Zufa had said nothing, possibly unable to believe the\n> Savant would want anything to do with her daughter. Luckily, Aurelius\n> had told her about it.\n>\n> Norma hurried off to the business district of the cliffside\n> settlement. She found Venport in a tea shop, concluding a meeting with\n> a seedy-looking trader. As the dark-skinned man rose from his seat,\n> Norma hurried over with her off-kilter gait and slid into his place at\n> the table.\n>\n> Venport smiled warmly at her. \"You look excited, Norma. You must have\n> found the letter from Savant Holtzman?\"\n>\n> She thrust the parchment forward. \"My mother tried to prevent me from\n> seeing his offer!\"\n>\n> \"Zufa is a maddening woman, I know, but you must try to understand\n> her. Since neither of us can do the things she values most, Zufa\n> disregards our abilities. Oh, she's aware of your mathematical\n> talents, Norma, and she knows I'm a competent businessman, but our\n> skills do not count for anything with her.\"\n>\n> Norma squirmed on the seat, not wanting to give her mother the benefit\n> of the doubt. \"Then why did she hide this letter?\"\n>\n> Venport laughed. \"She was probably embarrassed by the attention you\n> received.\" He squeezed her hand. \"Don't worry, I will intervene if\n> your mother attempts to block this. In fact, since she's so\n> preoccupied with the other Sorceresses, I can't see how she would\n> object if I were to complete the necessary paperwork for you.\"\n>\n> \"You would do that? Doesn't my mother---\"\n>\n> \"Let me take care of everything. I'll handle her.\" He gave Norma a\n> quick, warm hug. \"I believe in what you can do.\"\n>\n> Acting in Zufa's stead, Aurelius Venport dispatched a formal letter of\n> response to the famous inventor, agreeing to send Norma away. The\n> young woman would study with him on Poritrin and assist him in his\n> laboratories. For Norma, it was the opportunity of a lifetime.\n>\n> Her mother might not even notice she was gone.\n>\n> *Home can be anywhere, for it is a part of one's self.*\n>\n> --- Zensunni saying\n>\n> **E**ven in the wasteland, with wind whipping around him, Selim's luck\n> continued to hold. Survival itself became a wondrous game out in the\n> desert.\n>\n> Leaving the dead sandworm behind, he'd tried to find a small cave or\n> gully in the rocks where he could crouch from the approaching storm.\n> Desperately thirsty, Selim poked around for any signs of human\n> habitation, though he doubted any other man had ever set foot so far\n> out in the arid wilderness.\n>\n> Certainly no one who had lived.\n>\n> After wandering from planet to planet, the Zensunni had come to\n> Arrakis, where they scattered in widely separated settlements. For\n> several generations, the scavenger people had scraped a meager\n> existence from the desert, but only occasionally did they venture from\n> their protected areas, fearful of giant worms.\n>\n> The wild sandworm had taken Selim far from the spaceport, far from the\n> vital supplies that even the most resourceful Zensunni would require.\n> His prospects for survival seemed bleak indeed.\n>\n> So when he stumbled upon an ancient botanical testing station\n> camouflaged in the rocks, Selim could hardly believe his good fortune.\n> Undoubtedly, it was another sign from Buddallah. A miracle!\n>\n> He stood before the domed enclosure erected by long-forgotten\n> ecologists who had studied Arrakis and found it wanting. Perhaps a few\n> Old Empire scientists had lived here and recorded data during a storm\n> season. The rugged structure consisted of several low outbuildings\n> built into the rocks, half-disguised by time and windblown sand.\n>\n> As the howling tempest peppered him with stinging sand, Selim\n> scrambled around the abandoned station. He saw tilted weather vanes,\n> dented wind collectors and other data-gathering devices that looked\n> long dead. Most important, he found an entry hatch.\n>\n> With sore hands and aching arms from his worm-riding ordeal, Selim\n> pounded against the barrier, searching for a way inside. He scooped\n> powdery debris away, looking for some sort of manual mechanism, since\n> batteries would have long since died. He needed to get into the\n> shelter before the storm wind slammed into him with full intensity.\n>\n> Selim had heard of such places. A few had been found and raided by\n> Zensunni scavengers. These self-reliant stations had been placed on\n> Arrakis during humanity's glory days, before the thinking machines had\n> taken over, before Buddislamic refugees had fled to safety. This\n> automated facility was at least a thousand years old, probably more.\n> But in the desert, where the environment remained unchanged for\n> millennia, time ran at a different pace.\n>\n> Selim finally located the mechanism that controlled the hatch. As he\n> had feared, the power cells were dead, providing only enough of a\n> spark to make the door groan open the barest crack.\n>\n> The wind howled. Blown sand hung like fog on the horizon, obscuring\n> the sun. Dust tingled against his raw ears and face, and Selim knew it\n> would soon become a deadly scouring.\n>\n> Growing more desperate, he wedged his sandworm tooth into the dark\n> opening and used it as a pry bar. The aperture widened a little, but\n> not enough. Cold, stale air gasped out. He used the aching muscles in\n> his arms, dug his feet against the rocks to throw his body weight into\n> the effort, and pushed hard on the makeshift lever.\n>\n> With a last groan of resistance, the hatch grated partway open. Selim\n> laughed and tossed the curved worm fang into the interior, where it\n> made a tinkling clatter on the metal floor. He squirmed through into\n> the station, heard the muffled roar of the sandstorm increasing\n> outside. It was on top of him.\n>\n> Impeded by wind and blown sand, Selim grasped the lip of the hatch and\n> pushed hard. Incoming sand fell through a grating in the floor, into a\n> receptacle below. He needed to hurry. The wind let up for only a\n> second, but that was enough. He got the door shut, sealing himself in,\n> away from the violent weather.\n>\n> Safe . . . unbelievably safe. He laughed at his good fortune, then\n> gave a prayer of thanks, more sincere than any he had uttered in his\n> life. How could he question such blessings?\n>\n> Selim used the shaft of wan daylight to look around. Luckily, the\n> abandoned station had plaz windows. Though scratched and pitted from\n> prolonged exposure, they allowed fading illumination inside.\n>\n> The place was like a cave of treasure. Guided by the dust-filtered\n> light from the windows, he found a few old glowstrips which he coaxed\n> into brightening the small shelter. Then he ransacked cupboards and\n> storage vaults. Much of what remained was useless: unreadable\n> data-plaques, dead computerized recording systems, strange instruments\n> that bore the names of archaic corporations. He did, however, find\n> capsules of well-preserved food that had not deteriorated even in all\n> the time this facility had been abandoned.\n>\n> He broke open a capsule and ate the contents. Though the flavors were\n> unusual, the food tasted wonderful, and he felt energy seeping back\n> into his weary flesh. Other containers held concentrated juices, which\n> were like ambrosia to him. Most valuable of all, he found distilled\n> water, hundreds of literjons of it. Undoubtedly it had been collected\n> over the centuries by automated moisture extractors left behind by the\n> long-ago scientific expedition.\n>\n> This was personal wealth beyond anything Selim had imagined possible.\n> He could pay back the brackish water he'd been accused of taking from\n> the tribe a thousand times over. He could return to the Zensunni as a\n> hero. Naib Dhartha would have to forgive him. But Selim had never\n> committed the crime in the first place.\n>\n> While Selim sat comfortable and satisfied, he vowed never to give\n> Dhartha the satisfaction of seeing him return. Ebrahim had betrayed\n> his friendship, and the corrupt Naib had falsely condemned him. His\n> own people had exiled him, never expecting him to survive. Now that he\n> had found a way to live by himself, why would Selim ever want to go\n> back and surrender it all?\n>\n> For two straight nights, the young man slept. At dawn on the second\n> day he awoke and opened more of the sealed boxes and cabinets. He\n> discovered tools, rope, durable fabric, construction material. The\n> possibilities filled him with joy, and Selim found himself chuckling\n> all alone inside the botanical testing station.\n>\n> *I'm alive!*\n>\n> The storm had rattled past as he slept, unsuccessfully scratching\n> against the walls of the shelter like a monster trying to get in. Most\n> of the sand had been deflected, so very little was piled around the\n> enclosure. From the vantage of the station's largest window, Selim\n> gazed across the desert sea that he had crossed on the back of the\n> sandworm. The dunes were fresh and spotless. All signs of the dead\n> worm had been erased, scoured clean. Only this solitary young man\n> remained.\n>\n> He envisioned a long journey ahead of him, and thought he must have a\n> particular calling. Why else would Buddallah have gone to so much\n> trouble to allow poor Selim to live?\n>\n> *What do you want me to do?*\n>\n> Smiling, the outcast looked out upon the desert, wondering how he\n> could possibly cross such an expanse again. The vista filled him with\n> a sensation of supreme solitude. He made out a few rocks in the\n> distance, etched by eternal winds. Here and there were a few hardy\n> plants. Small animals scurried into burrows. Dune merged into dune,\n> desert into desert.\n>\n> Enthralled by his own memories and feeling recklessly invulnerable,\n> Selim decided what he must do, sooner or later. The first time had\n> been an incredible fluke, but he understood better how to do it now.\n>\n> He must ride a sandworm again. And the next time it would not be an\n> accident.\n>\n> *One of the questions the Butlerian Jihad answered with violence was\n> whether the human body is simply a machine that a* man-made *machine\n> can duplicate. The results of the war answered the question.*\n\n--- DR. RAJID SUK,\n\n*Post-Trauma Analysis of the Human Species*\n\n> **W**earing a new warrior-form designed to strike terror into the\n> humans on Giedi Prime, Agamemnon strode on armored legs through the\n> broken industries and flaming ruins of the city. The *hrethgir* hadn't\n> stood a chance.\n>\n> Giedi Prime had been conquered easily.\n>\n> The invading machine troops plodded forward, targeting habitation\n> complexes and setting them aflame, blasting parks into blackened\n> fields. In accordance with Agamemnon's orders--- citing the glory of\n> Omnius--- the neo-cymeks and robotic warriors left the Giedi City\n> industries essentially intact.\n>\n> Agamemnon had sworn that Giedi Prime would make up for the cymeks'\n> humiliation on Salusa. Even now, watcheyes flew overhead, recording\n> the carnage, seeing how efficiently the two Titans guided the military\n> operation.\n>\n> Accompanied by his comrade Barbarossa, Agamemnon scanned the\n> topography of the metropolis and located the Magnus's magnificent\n> residence. It was an appropriate place to establish the new center of\n> Synchronized government, a symbolic gesture of domination as well as\n> an affront to the defeated populace.\n>\n> The cymek general's warrior-form was the most monstrous multilegged\n> system he had ever conceived. Electrical discharges fired through\n> artificial muscles, pulling fiber cables taut and moving\n> weapon-studded limbs. He flexed his flowmetal claws and crushed\n> construction blocks in his grip,\n>\n> imagining them to be the skulls of enemies. Following in his own\n> ferocious configuration, Barbarossa laughed at the showmanship.\n>\n> Marching forward on many limbs, the cymeks thundered through the\n> wreckage-strewn streets. Nothing stood in the way of these former\n> warlords. The situation reminded both of them of a thousand years\n> before, when twenty Titans had conquered the Old Empire by trampling\n> the bodies of their foes.\n>\n> This was the way it should be. It only whetted their appetite for\n> more.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> PRIOR TO THE attack, Agamemnon had studied Giedi Prime's defenses,\n> analyzing images taken by spy watcheyes that zoomed through the system\n> like tiny meteoroids. From those readings, the cymek general had\n> concocted a brilliant tactical move, exploiting a slight weakness in\n> planetary defenses. Omnius had been willing to pay the necessary price\n> to take over a League World, and it had not cost the life of a single\n> Titan, not even one of the lesser neo-cymeks. Only a single robotic\n> cruiser. Perfectly acceptable, as far as Agamemnon was concerned.\n>\n> The humans had erected scrambler fields here like those on Salusa,\n> centering their transmitting towers in Giedi City. The field-generator\n> facility had been guarded by kindjal fighter craft, supposedly\n> impregnable embankments, and massively armored ground vehicles. The\n> feral humans had learned a lesson on Salusa Secundus. But it was not\n> enough to protect them from obliteration.\n>\n> Giedi Prime's first-line orbital protective forces had been brushed\n> aside by the unstoppable force of the giant machine fleet. All robot\n> losses were acceptable. When Agamemnon led the cymek ships in, along\n> with the sacrificial cruisers, the planetbound human defenders could\n> not hope to drive them back.\n>\n> To begin the assault, the huge robotic cruiser had positioned itself\n> above Giedi Prime, its cargo holds filled with explosives. Dozens of\n> other robot\n>\n> cruisers moved with machine grace, sleek and streamlined, lining up\n> for the assault. Guided by a thinking machine intelligence, the\n> enormous craft fired its engines and accelerated at full speed toward\n> its target.\n>\n> \"Descent approach in progress,\" the battleship's robot mind had\n> reported, transmitting images to the waiting fighters. Ahead, thirty\n> decoy vessels shot downward, also hoping to strike the target but\n> designed to be targets for the ground-based missile defenses. The plan\n> relied on brute force and overwhelming numbers, not finesse.\n> Nevertheless, it would be effective.\n>\n> With its engines at full speed, the sacrificial vessel had accelerated\n> white-hot into Giedi Prime's atmosphere, faster than any ground-based\n> human missile defenses could target and respond. The other cruisers\n> approached the invisible scrambler shield. Already, gray-white\n> blossoms of smoke and explosions marked where the ground-launched\n> missiles had found targets. The numbers dwindled, as did the distance.\n> The humans could never stop all the invaders.\n>\n> The doomed robot ship sent final images back to the watcheyes so\n> Omnius would have a complete record of the conquest of Giedi Prime.\n> Every nanosecond--- until it passed through the scrambler net, which\n> effectively erased the AI guidance brain. The transmissions became\n> static, then an empty carrier wave.\n>\n> Still, the juggernaut had continued to descend. Even with its\n> gelcircuitry brain neutralized, the plummeting cruiser fell like an\n> asteroidsized hammer.\n>\n> Kindjal fighter craft directly engaged the last explosive-laden\n> vessel, but the inbound ship was too big and too hot to be swerved.\n> The defenders' shots amounted to little more than pellets.\n>\n> The giant dead vessel slammed into the field transmitters on the\n> outskirts of Giedi City. A crater half a kilometer wide flashed into\n> steam; the transmitters, the overwhelmed defenses, and the surrounding\n> inhabited areas all vanished.\n>\n> Shockwaves had toppled buildings for kilometers around and shattered\n> windows. Holtzman's scrambler shields were neutralized in the blink of\n> an eye, and the Giedi Home Guard was crippled.\n>\n> After that, the cymeks and robots had come down in full force.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> \"BARBAROSSA, MY FRIEND, shall we make our grand entrance?\" Agamemnon\n> said, arriving at the residence of the Magnus.\n>\n> \"Just like when we followed Tlaloc into the halls of the Old Empire,\"\n> his fellow Titan agreed. \"It has been a long time since I've enjoyed a\n> victory so much.\"\n>\n> They led enthusiastic neo-cymeks easily through the reeling\n> metropolis. The stunned human inhabitants could not even put up a\n> fight. Behind the cymek conquerors marched robotic troops to help\n> secure the territory.\n>\n> Although part of Giedi Prime's population might flee underground and\n> hide, the citizenry would break, given time.

Within moments, the robots brought blond-haired\n> Magnus Sumi before the two Titans.\n>\n> \"We claim your planet in the name of Omnius,\" Barbarossa declared.\n> \"Giedi Prime is now a Synchronized World. We require your cooperation\n> to consolidate our victory.\"\n>\n> Magnus Sumi, trembling with fear, nevertheless spat on the broken\n> floor where the weight of the cymek warrior-forms had crushed his\n> carefully laid tiles.\n>\n> \"Bow to us,\" Barbarossa said.\n>\n> The Magnus laughed. \"You're mad. I would never---\"\n>\n> Agamemnon swung one of his sleek metal arms sideways. He had not fully\n> tested this new body and was not aware of the magnitude of his\n> strength. He had meant to strike the governor in the face, an\n> instinctive angry slap. Instead, the arm delivered a blow so forceful\n> that it ripped the man's torso in half. The two parts of his body\n> thudded against the far wall in a splatter of gore.\n>\n> \"Oh, well. My demand was a mere formality anyway.\" Agamemnon turned\n> optic threads toward his comrade. \"Begin your work, Barbarossa. These\n> robots will assist.\"\n>\n> The Titan programming genius began dismantling the household systems\n> in the governor's residence and setting up power conduits and\n> machinery. He added linkages and installed a blank, resilient\n> gelsphere mainframe into which he uploaded the newest version of\n> Omnius's mind.\n>\n> The process took several hours, during which the thinking machine\n> invasion force moved through the city, putting out fires and shoring\n> up damaged industrial buildings that Agamemnon considered important\n> for the planet's continued utility.\n>\n> The habitation complexes of the surviving humans, though, were left to\n> burn. The suffering people could fend for themselves. Misery would\n> help them understand the hopelessness of their position.\n>\n> Floating overhead, the annoying watcheyes recorded everything. At\n> least it was a victory this time. Agamemnon revealed no sign of his\n> impatience or displeasure, knowing that resistance against the\n> computer evermind would be fruitless. *For now*. Instead, he must\n> select the proper place and time.\n>\n> Once installed and activated, the new incarnation of Omnius would show\n> no appreciation toward the two seemingly loyal Titans for their\n> victory, nor would the evermind begrudge the loss of his machine\n> juggernaut. It was a military operation well executed, and the\n> Synchronized Worlds had now added one of humanity's jewels to its\n> empire. A psychological and strategic success.\n>\n> When the immense download was finally complete, Agamemnon activated\n> the new copy of the distributed evermind. Systems surged alive, and\n> the omniscient computer began to survey its new domain.\n>\n> \"Welcome, Lord Omnius,\" Agamemnon said to the wallspeakers. \"I present\n> to you the gift of another world.\"\n>\n> *We are happiest when planning our futures, letting our optimism and\n> imagination run unrestrained. Unfortunately, the universe does not\n> always heed such plans.*\n\n--- ABBESS LIVIA BUTLER,\n\nprivate journals\n\n> **A**lthough their marriage was a foregone conclusion, Serena and\n> Xavier happily endured the extravagant betrothal banquet thrown by\n> Viceroy Manion Butler at his hilltop estate.\n>\n> Emil and Lucille Tantor had brought baskets of apples and pears from\n> their orchards and huge jars of herbed olive oil for dipping the\n> fresh-baked engagement rolls. Manion Butler served up exquisite roasts\n> of beef, spice-crusted fowl, and stuffed fishes.

The women secured their dark hair with\n> jeweled combs and wore white dresses adorned with embroidered\n> patterns. The flowing skirts flew like whirlwinds about their waists,\n> while dapper gentlemen strutted around them like peacocks in a mating\n> challenge. Brassy music offset by soulful balisets drifted through the\n> afternoon.\n>\n> Xavier and Serena wore impressive outfits befitting a proud military\n> officer and the talented daughter of the League Viceroy. They strolled\n> among the assembled guests, careful to address each family\n> representative by name. The couple sampled prized wines from dusty\n> bottles brought in by the scions of every household. Xavier, who could\n> taste none of the subtleties in the vintages, took care not to get too\n> drunk; he was already giddy at the prospect of his upcoming marriage.\n>\n> Serena's sister Octa, two years younger, seemed equally excited. With\n> her long chestnut hair adorned by fresh cornflowers, Octa's eyes were\n> wide\n>\n> with amazement, enchanted by her sister's beau and fantasizing about a\n> handsome young officer who might be her own husband one day.\n>\n> Amazingly, Serena's reclusive mother Livia came to spend the\n> celebratory weekend at the Butler manor. Manion's wife rarely left the\n> City of Introspection, a retreat where she kept herself from the cares\n> and nightmares of the world. The enlightened philosophical preserve,\n> owned by a Butler trust, had originally been established to study and\n> ponder the Zen Hekiganshu of III Delta Pavonis, the Tawrah and\n> Talmudic Zabur, even the Obeah Ritual. But under Butler patronage, the\n> City had gradually blossomed into something the likes of which had not\n> been seen for millennia.\n>\n> Xavier had not seen Serena's mother often, especially in recent years.\n> With her tanned skin and lean features, Livia Butler was a handsome\n> beauty. She rejoiced in the betrothal of her daughter and seemed to\n> enjoy herself as she danced with her jovial husband or sat beside him\n> at the banquet table. She looked not at all like a woman who had fled\n> from the world.\n>\n> Years ago, Livia and Manion's strong marriage had been envied by many\n> noble families. Serena was their eldest child, but they also had twins\n> two years younger: the calm and shy Octa and a sensitive, intelligent\n> boy, Fredo. While Serena underwent political schooling, the twins were\n> raised as close companions, though neither had the far-ranging\n> aspirations of their older sister.\n>\n> Fredo had been fascinated by musical instruments and folk songs,\n> traditions from the grandest planets of the former Empire. He learned\n> to be a musician and poet, while Octa was intrigued with painting and\n> sculpture. In Salusan society, artisans and creative people were\n> highly respected, as admirable as any politician.\n>\n> But at the age of fourteen, honey-voiced Fredo died of a wasting\n> disease, his skin splotched with purplish discolorations. For months,\n> he'd grown thinner and thinner, his muscles atrophying. His blood\n> would not clot, and he could not keep even the thinnest of broths in\n> his stomach. The Salusan\n>\n> doctors had never seen anything like it. Frantic, Viceroy Butler\n> begged the League for help.\n>\n> The men of Rossak offered a number of experimental drugs from their\n> fungoid jungles to treat Fredo's undiagnosed malady. Livia insisted on\n> trying everything. Unfortunately, the young man reacted poorly to the\n> third Rossak drug, an allergic response that caused his throat to\n> swell. Fredo went into convulsions and stopped breathing.\n>\n> Octa had mourned the loss of her brother and came to fear for her own\n> life as well. Fredo's disease was eventually determined to be\n> genetically based, meaning that she and her older sister were at risk\n> of contracting the fatal malady themselves. Octa took care with her\n> health and lived each day dreading that her life would come to a slow,\n> painful end like that of her brother.\n>\n> Fiercely confident and optimistic, Serena always tried to console her\n> sister, giving her a shoulder to cry on, offering encouragement.\n> Though neither sister had shown signs of the strange disease, Octa's\n> dreams had lost all momentum, and she gave up her artwork, becoming a\n> quieter, more pensive soul. She was a frail teenager now, hoping for a\n> spark of wonder to bring her back to the fullness of life.\n>\n> Though her husband had a brilliant political career and his importance\n> grew with each season, formerly vivacious Livia had withdrawn from\n> public life to her spiritual retreat, where she focused on\n> philosophical and religious pursuits. She donated large sums to the\n> imposing fortress to build additional meditation chambers, temples,\n> and libraries. After devoting many sleepless nights to frank\n> discussions with the Cogitor Kwyna, Livia became the Abbess of the\n> facility.\n>\n> In the aftermath of the tragedy, Manion Butler had immersed himself in\n> League work, while Serena felt a heavier burden and set higher goals.\n> Though she could do nothing to help her brother, she wanted to stop\n> the suffering of other people whenever she could. She plunged into\n> politics, working to stop the practice of human slavery still common\n> on some\n>\n> League Worlds, and pledging herself to finding a way to overthrow the\n> thinking machines. No one had ever accused her of lacking in vision or\n> energy. . . .\n>\n> Living separate lives now, Manion and Livia Butler remained pillars of\n> Salusan society, proud of each other's accomplishments--- not\n> divorced, not even emotionally separated . . . just following\n> different paths. Xavier knew that Serena's mother occasionally came\n> back to spend nights with her husband and enjoy weekends with her\n> daughters. But she always returned to the City of Introspection.\n>\n> Serena's betrothal had been important enough to bring her mother into\n> the public eye again. After Xavier danced with his future bride four\n> times in a row, Abbess Livia insisted on having a dance with her\n> future son-in-law.\n>\n> Later, during a long acoustic set of the Long March Ballads played by\n> native Salusan minstrels, Xavier and Serena slipped into the manor\n> house, leaving Livia to weep unabashedly as she watched the musicians\n> and remembered how Fredo had wanted to become a player himself. Manion\n> sat beside his wife, rocking her gently.\n>\n> At the event in their honor, Xavier and Serena had by now experienced\n> their fill of company and revelry, of greeting guests and sampling\n> food and wine. They laughed at every witticism, whether subtle or\n> crude, so as not to offend the grand families. By now, the two were\n> desperate for just a few moments alone.\n>\n> Finally they slipped away and hurried through the corridors of the\n> manor house, past hot kitchens and musty storerooms, to a small alcove\n> outside the Winter Sun room. In winter, slanted sunshine lit this room\n> with bronze rainbows. The Butler family traditionally took their\n> breakfasts here during the cold season, enjoying family conversation\n> while they watched the rising sun. It was a place of fond memories for\n> Serena.\n>\n> She crowded with Xavier into the alcove just outside the room;\n> glow-panels shone in the hall, but still allowed a few rich shadows.\n> Serena pulled him close and kissed him. He placed a hand behind her\n> neck and stroked her\n>\n> hair as he pulled her face close to his and kissed more deeply, hungry\n> for her.\n>\n> When they heard hurried footsteps in the hall, the lovers hid in\n> silence, quietly chuckling at their secret rendezvous. But fresh-faced\n> Octa easily found them. Flushed with embarrassment, Octa averted her\n> gaze. \"You must come back to the banquet hall. Father is ready to\n> serve dessert. And an offworld messenger is coming.\"\n>\n> \"A messenger?\" Xavier suddenly sounded military and formal. \"From\n> whom?\"\n>\n> \"He went to Zimia demanding an audience with the League Parliament,\n> but since most of the nobles are here for the banquet, he's on his way\n> up the hill.\"\n>\n> Bending his elbows outward, Xavier offered an arm to each sister. \"Let\n> us go together so we can hear what this messenger has to say.\" Forcing\n> a lighthearted tone, he said, \"After all, I haven't eaten enough\n> today. I could use a bowl of roast custard and a whole plateful of\n> candied eggs.\"\n>\n> Octa giggled, but Serena gave him a mock stern frown. \"I suppose I\n> must resign myself to life with a fat husband.\"\n>\n> They entered the large hall, where the guests gathered around a long\n> table, complimenting the array of extraordinarily beautiful desserts\n> that looked too precious to be eaten. Manion and Livia Butler stood\n> side by side, raising a toast to the couple.\n>\n> Sipping politely from his wine, Xavier detected an undercurrent of\n> worry in the Viceroy's manner. Everyone pretended to be unconcerned\n> about what news the messenger might bring, but the moment a pounding\n> sounded on the door, all activity stopped. Manion Butler himself\n> opened the wooden portal, gesturing for the man to enter.\n>\n> He wasn't a formal courier. His eyes were haunted and his officer's\n> uniform unkempt, as if he no longer cared about protocol or\n> appearances. Xavier\n>\n> recognized the insignia of the Giedi Prime Home Guard. Like other\n> League uniforms, it bore the gold sigil of free humanity on the lapel.\n>\n> \"I have grave news, Viceroy Butler. The fastest ships have brought me\n> directly here.\"\n>\n> \"What is it, young man?\" Manion's voice was filled with dread.\n>\n> \"Giedi Prime has fallen to the thinking machines!\" The officer raised\n> his voice against the guests' disbelieving outcries. \"The robots and\n> cymeks found a flaw in our defenses and destroyed our scrambler-field\n> transmitters. Much of our population has been slaughtered and the\n> survivors enslaved. A new Omnius evermind has already been activated.\"\n>\n> The people in the hall wailed at hearing of the devastating defeat.\n> Xavier clutched Serena's hand so tightly he feared he might hurt her.\n> Inside, he had turned to stone, his stomach filled with a cold\n> heaviness.\n>\n> He had just been to Giedi Prime, had inspected the defenses himself.\n> Xavier had been terribly anxious to finish his inspection tour so that\n> he could return to Serena. Could he possibly have missed something? He\n> squeezed his eyes shut as the questions and disbelieving comments\n> turned to a buzz around him. Was he to blame? Had a simple mistake, a\n> bit of impatience from a young man in love, caused an entire planet to\n> fall?\n>\n> Manion Butler placed both palms on the table to steady himself. Livia\n> reached over to touch her husband's shoulder, adding silent support.\n> She closed her eyes, and her lips moved as if in prayer.\n>\n> The Viceroy spoke. \"Another free planet lost to the Synchronized\n> Worlds, and one of our strongholds, too.\" He straightened, took a\n> shuddering breath. \"We must call an immediate war council, summon all\n> representatives.\" With a meaningful glance at Serena, he added, \"Let\n> us also include anyone who speaks for the Unallied Planets and wishes\n> to join us in this fight.\"\n>\n> *Everything in the universe contains flaws, ourselves included. Even\n> God does not attempt perfection in His creations. Only mankind has\n> such foolish arrogance.*\n>\n> --- COGITOR KWYNA,\n\nCity of Introspection archives\n\n> **H**er screams rang through the quiet cliff cities above the\n> silvery-purple jungle. Inside her private chamber, Zufa Cenva lay\n> sweat-streaked on a pallet. She shrieked in pain, clenching her teeth,\n> her eyes glassy.\n>\n> Alone. No one dared come near a delirious Sorceress of Rossak.\n>\n> A metallic doorway curtain rattled with an invisible tele-kinetic\n> force. Wall shelves buckled in the aftershocks of Zufa's psychic\n> explosions, scattering pots and keepsakes all over the floor.\n>\n> Her long white hair was wild, quivering with internal energy. Her pale\n> hands gripped the sides of the pallet like scraping claws. If any\n> woman had come close enough to try to soothe her, Zufa would have\n> scratched her face and mentally hurled her against the whitewashed\n> walls.\n>\n> She screamed again. The chief Sorceress had endured several\n> miscarriages before, but never one so agonizing or disruptive. She\n> cursed worthless Aurelius Venport.\n>\n> Zufa's spine shuddered, as if someone had jolted her with electricity.\n> Delicate ornamental objects floated into the air on invisible strings,\n> then flew in every direction, smashing into shards. One hollowed-out\n> irongourd stuffed with dried flowers burst into white flames,\n> crackling and smoking.\n>\n> She gasped as her body cramped, squeezing her abdominal muscles. It\n> seemed as if this unborn child wanted to kill her, to drag her down to\n> death before she could expel it from her uterus.\n>\n> Another failure! And she so desperately wanted to produce a true\n> daughter, a successor to lead her fellow Sorceresses to new heights of\n> mental power. The genetic index had misled her again. Damn Venport and\n> his failings! She should have abandoned him long ago.\n>\n> Out of her head with pain and despair, Zufa wanted to kill the man who\n> had planted the child-seed inside her, even though the pregnancy had\n> been at her own insistence. She had completed the bloodline\n> calculations so carefully, had gone over the genes again and again.\n> Breeding with Venport should have produced only superior offspring.\n>\n> Nothing like this.\n>\n> Telepathic blasts echoed into the corridors, sending Rossak women\n> scurrying in terror. Then she saw Aurelius Venport himself standing at\n> the doorway, haggard with worry. His eyes were filled with concern.\n>\n> But Zufa knew he was a liar.\n>\n> Unafraid for his own safety, Venport entered their bedchamber,\n> displaying patience, concern, and tolerance. His lover's mental blasts\n> ricocheted around the large room, overturning furniture. In a petulant\n> attempt to slight him, she smashed a set of tiny hollownut sculptures\n> he had given her during their courtship and genetic testing.\n>\n> Still, he stepped forward, as if immune to her ferine outbursts. In\n> the hall behind him, muted voices urged caution, but he ignored them.\n> He came to her pallet, smiling with compassion and understanding.\n>\n> Venport knelt beside the bed, stroking her sweaty hand. He whispered\n> soothing nonsense in her ears. She couldn't understand his words, but\n> she grasped his fingers until she expected to feel the bones snap. But\n> he remained frustratingly close, not intimidated by her in the least.\n>\n> Zufa hurled accusations of treachery at him. \"I can sense your\n> thoughts! I know you're thinking only of yourself.\"\n>\n> Her imagination concocted schemes, attributing them to his\n> deviousness. If the great Zufa Cenva was no longer there to protect\n> him, who would keep this man as a pet? Who would care for him? She\n> doubted he could take care of himself.\n>\n> Then, with greater fear:*Or could he?*\n>\n> Venport had sent Norma off on a long journey to Poritrin, arranging\n> everything behind Zufa's back, as if he believed that a man like Tio\n> Holtzman truly wanted to work with her daughter. What was he planning?\n> She gritted her teeth, wanting to prove that she understood his\n> intentions. Her threats came as sharp gasps. \"You can't . . . let me\n> die, bastard! No one . . . else would . . . have you!\"\n>\n> Instead, he looked at her, coolly patronizing. \"You've told me many\n> times that I come from a good genetic line, my darling. But I do not\n> desire someone else among the Sorceresses. I prefer to stay with you.\"\n> He lowered his voice, looking at her with an oddly intense love that\n> she could not quite fathom. \"I understand you better than you do\n> yourself, Zufa Cenva. Always pushing, constantly demanding more than\n> anyone can possibly give. Nobody--- not even you--- can be perfect all\n> the time.\"\n>\n> With a final prolonged shriek, she expelled her deformed, resistant\n> fetus, a monstrously abnormal creature. Seeing the bright blood,\n> Venport bellowed for assistance, and two brave midwives scurried into\n> the chamber. One reached down with a towel, placing it over the fetus\n> like a shroud, while the other bathed Zufa's skin, adding pain-numbing\n> salves distilled from jungle spores. Venport sent for the best drugs\n> from his own stockpiles.\n>\n> Finally, he took the squirming fetus himself, holding the bloody\n> larval thing in his hands. It had dark skin and strange mottled spots\n> that made it look as if proto-eyes had grown all over its limbless\n> body. He saw the thing twitch a final time, then it stopped moving.\n>\n> He wrapped it up in the towel, trying to ignore the tear in his eye.\n> His expression stony, Venport handed the corrupt fetus to one of the\n> midwives,\n>\n> saying nothing. It would be taken out into the jungles, and no one\n> would ever see it again.\n>\n> The exhausted Sorceress lay back, shuddering, just now beginning to\n> feel a sense of reality and despair again. The miscarriage had hurt\n> her, leaving her with a deep sadness that went beyond the goals of any\n> breeding program. Her vision returned to focus, and she noticed the\n> psychokinetic destruction she had caused in the room. It all spoke of\n> weakness, of lack of control.\n>\n> This was her third horrific miscarriage from mating with Venport. Deep\n> disappointment and anger boiled inside her. \"I chose you for your\n> bloodline, Aurelius,\" she muttered through dry lips. \"What went\n> wrong?\"\n>\n> He looked at her, still expressionless, as if his passion had been\n> washed away. \"Genetics is not an exact science.\"\n>\n> Zufa closed her eyes. \"Failures, always failures.\" She was the\n> greatest Sorceress of Rossak, and yet she had endured so many\n> disappointments. Sighing with disgust, Zufa thought of her stunted\n> daughter, not wanting to believe that the ugly dwarf was the best she\n> could achieve.\n>\n> Venport shook his head, uncharacteristically stern and impatient now\n> that the danger was past. \"You have had successes, Zufa. You just\n> don't know how to recognize them.\"\n>\n> She forced herself to rest, to recuperate. Eventually, Zufa would have\n> to try again, but with someone else.\n>\n> *Overly organized research is confining, and guaranteed to produce\n> nothing new.*\n>\n> --- TIO HOLTZMAN,\n\nletter to Lord Niko Bludd\n\n> **A**rriving on Poritrin at the conclusion of her first long space\n> voyage, Norma Cenva felt out of place. Her diminutive form drew\n> glances, but was not so unusual that people turned pitying stares upon\n> her. On the Unallied Planets there was a variety of races, some with\n> stunted statures. She didn't care about the opinions of others anyway.\n> She only wanted to impress Tio Holtzman.\n>\n> Before Norma's departure from Rossak, her aloof mother had looked down\n> at her with dismissive puzzlement. Zufa chose to believe that the\n> brilliant Savant had made a mistake or had misread one of Norma's\n> theoretical papers. She expected her daughter to return home before\n> long.\n>\n> Aurelius Venport had made all of the arrangements, used his own\n> profits to pay for a nicer cabin than Holtzman had offered. While her\n> mother continued to work with the Sorceress trainees, Venport had\n> accompanied Norma to the docking-transfer stations in Rossak orbit. He\n> had given her a gift of delicately petrified flowers and a chaste hug\n> before she'd climbed aboard the vessel. With a wry smile, he told her,\n> \"All of us disappointments need to stick together.\"\n>\n> Norma held onto that warm but troubling comment during the long\n> journey to Poritrin. . . .\n>\n> When the shuttle landed in the river-delta city of Starda, Norma\n> carefully inserted Venport's petrified flowers into her mousy brown\n> hair, a sprig of beauty that contrasted with the plainness of her wide\n> face, large head, and rounded nose. She wore a loose blouse and\n> comfortable hose, both woven from fernfibers.\n>\n> Jostled by other passengers crowded at the shuttle hatch, the girl\n> carried only a small travel pack. Climbing down the ramp, Norma felt\n> flushed and eager to meet the scientist she admired, a thinker who\n> took her seriously. She had heard many stories of Savant Holtzman's\n> mathematical prowess, and she would be hard pressed to contribute\n> anything the great man hadn't already developed. She hoped she would\n> not let him down.\n>\n> Scanning the waiting crowd, she immediately recognized the eminent\n> scientist. A clean-shaven man with shoulder-length gray hair, Holtzman\n> appeared to be in his late middle years. His hands and fingernails\n> were clean, his clothing impeccable and ornamented with stylish\n> designs and badges.\n>\n> He greeted her with a broad smile and open arms that let the sleeves\n> of his white robe droop. \"Welcome to Poritrin, Miss Cenva.\" Holtzman\n> placed both hands on her shoulders in formal greeting. If he\n> experienced any disappointment upon seeing Norma's stature and coarse,\n> unattractive features, he did not show it. \"I certainly hope you've\n> brought your imagination with you.\" He gestured toward a doorway. \"We\n> have a lot of work to do together.\"\n>\n> He steered her through the spaceport crowds, away from their curious\n> stares, then took her away from Starda Spaceport in a private\n> limo-barge that floated high above the graceful Isana River.\n>\n> \"Poritrin is a peaceful world, where I can let my mind wander and\n> think of things that might save the human race.\" Holtzman smiled\n> proudly at her. \"I'm expecting that of you, too.\"\n>\n> \"I will do my best, Savant Holtzman.\"\n>\n> \"What more could any person ask?\"\n>\n> The skies of Poritrin held a gauze of clouds painted citrus yellow\n> with afternoon sunlight. The barge drifted above the multifingered\n> streamlets that wrapped around shifting islands and sandbars.\n> Traditional boats rode the current of the broad river, loaded with\n> grains and cargo for distribution\n>\n> in the port city and export offworld. Fertile Poritrin fed many\n> less-fortunate planets, in return for which they received raw\n> materials, equipment, manufactured goods, and human slaves to add to\n> their labor force.\n>\n> Some of the largest buildings in the spaceport were actually boats on\n> pontoons, anchored to the bases of sandstone bluffs. The roofs were\n> composed of layered shingles of silver-blue metal, smelted in mines\n> far to the north.\n>\n> He gestured to a bluff overlooking the crowded portions of blue-roofed\n> Starda, where she could recognize the influences of classic\n> Navachristian architecture. \"My laboratories are up there. Buildings\n> and supply sheds, quarters for my slaves and solvers, as well as my\n> own home--- everything built into that double spire of rock.\"\n>\n> The floating transport circled toward two sections of stone, like\n> adjacent fingers rising above the riverbed. She could see sheetplaz\n> windows, awning-covered balconies, and a walkway that linked a dome on\n> one spire with a conical stone tower and outbuildings on the other.\n>\n> Holtzman was pleased to note the amazement on her face. \"We have\n> quarters for you, Norma, in addition to private lab facilities and a\n> team of assistants to perform calculations based upon your theories. I\n> expect you to keep them all very busy.\"\n>\n> Norma looked at him, puzzled. \"Someone else to do the mathematics?\"\n>\n> \"Of course!\" Holtzman brushed iron-gray hair away from his face and\n> adjusted his white robe. \"You're an *idea* person, like me. We want\n> you to develop concepts, not bother with full-fledged implementation.\n> You should not waste time performing tedious arithmetic. Any\n> halfway-trained person can do that. It's what slaves are for.\"\n>\n> When the floating barge settled onto a glazed-tile deck, servants\n> emerged to take Norma's bags and offer the two of them cool drinks.\n> Like an eager boy, Holtzman led Norma to his impressive laboratories.\n> The large rooms were filled with water clocks and magnetic sculptures\n> in which spheres orbited\n>\n> about electrical paths without wires or gears. Sketches and\n> half-finished drawings covered electrostatic boards, surrounded by\n> serpentine calculations that went nowhere.\n>\n> Glancing around, Norma realized that Holtzman had abandoned more\n> concepts than she had ever created in her life. Even so, many of the\n> cluttered papers and geometric drawings looked a bit old. Some of the\n> ink had faded, and papers were curled around the edges.\n>\n> With a swish of his wide sleeves, Holtzman gave the intriguing items a\n> dismissive wave. \"Just toys, useless gadgets that I keep for my\n> amusement.\" He poked a finger at one of the floating silver balls,\n> which sent the other model planets into dangerous orbits, spinning\n> about like heavenly bodies out of control. \"Sometimes I dabble with\n> them for inspiration, but usually they only make me think of other\n> toys, not the weapons of mass destruction we need in order to save us\n> from the tyranny of machines.\"\n>\n> With a distracted frown, Holtzman continued, \"My work is constrained\n> in that I cannot use sophisticated computers. In order to perform the\n> enormous calculations required to test a theory, I have no recourse\n> but to rely upon human mental abilities and hope for the best from the\n> fallible calculational skills of trained people. Come, let me show you\n> the solvers.\"\n>\n> He led her to a well-illuminated chamber with high windows. Inside,\n> numerous identical benches and flat tabletops had been set up in a\n> grid layout. Workers hunched over each writing surface using handheld\n> calculation devices. From their drab garments and dull expressions,\n> Norma judged that these men and women must be some of Poritrin's\n> numerous slaves.\n>\n> \"This is the only way we can imitate the abilities of a thinking\n> machine,\" Holtzman explained. \"A computer can handle billions of\n> iterations. We have a harder time of it, yet with enough people\n> working in concert and as specialists, we accomplish billions of\n> calculations on our own. It just takes longer.\"\n>\n> He walked down the narrow aisles between the solvers, who were\n> furiously scribing numbers and mathematical symbols on flat slates,\n> checking and double-checking answers before passing them on to the\n> next person in line.\n>\n> \"Even the most complex math can be broken into a sequence of trivial\n> steps. Each of these slaves has been trained to complete specific\n> equations in an assembly-line fashion. When taken together, this\n> collective human mind is capable of remarkable feats.\" Holtzman\n> surveyed the room as if he expected his solvers to give him a\n> resounding cheer. Instead, they studied their work with heavy-lidded\n> eyes, moving through equation after equation with no comprehension of\n> reasons or larger pictures.\n>\n> Norma felt sympathy for them, having been belittled and ignored for so\n> long herself. She knew intellectually that human slavery was a way of\n> life on many League Worlds, as it was throughout the machine-ruled\n> planets. Nevertheless, she supposed that these workers would prefer\n> doing mental work to heavy labor out in the agricultural fields.\n>\n> With a magnanimous gesture, the scientist said, \"Every solver is at\n> your disposal, Norma, whenever you develop a theory that needs\n> verification. The next stage, of course is to build prototypes for\n> further testing and development. We have plenty of labs and test\n> facilities, but the most important work comes first.\" He tapped a\n> fingertip on his own forehead. *\"Up here.\"*\n>\n> Holtzman gave her a cockeyed grin and lowered his voice. \"Mistakes are\n> possible, of course, even at our level. If that happens, we hope that\n> Lord Niko Bludd is tolerant enough to keep us around.\"\n>\n> *Only those with narrow minds fail to see that the definition of\n> Impossible is 'Lack of imagination and incentive.'*\n>\n> --- SERENA BUTLER\n>\n> **I**n the front parlor of the Butler manor house, Xavier Harkonnen\n> shifted on a green brocaded settee. His duty uniform was not designed\n> for lounging in fine furniture. Ornate gold-framed paintings of Butler\n> ancestors adorned the walls, including one like a caricature of a\n> gentleman with a waxed handlebar mustache and a tricorner hat.\n>\n> Between tight duty shifts, he had rushed here to surprise Serena, and\n> the servants had asked him to wait. Blushing, Octa came into the\n> parlor, carrying a cool drink for him. Though he had always seen her\n> as Serena's little sister, Xavier realized with surprise that she was\n> actually a lovely young woman. With Serena's recent betrothal, Octa\n> might be dreaming of her own marriage, if she could ever overcome her\n> shy infatuation with him.\n>\n> \"Serena wasn't expecting you, but she'll be right out.\" Octa looked\n> away. \"She's in a meeting with official-looking men and women,\n> assistants carrying electronic equipment, a few Militia uniforms.\n> Something to do with her Parliament work, I think.\"\n>\n> Xavier gave a wan smile. \"We both have so many projects, but such\n> times demand it.\"\n>\n> While Octa occupied herself straightening books and statuettes on a\n> shelf, Xavier thought back to a Parliament session he had watched two\n> days before. Upset over the tragic fall of Giedi Prime, Serena had\n> tried to rally representatives from the strongest planets, hoping to\n> mount a rescue operation. She always wanted to *do* something; it was\n> one of the reasons Xavier loved her so much. While others accepted the\n> defeat and cringed in fear that Omnius would push for more conquests,\n> Serena wanted to charge in and save the world. Any world.\n>\n> Dressed in a long gown, she had spoken passionately in the temporary\n> Hall of Parliament. \"We can't just give up on Giedi Prime! The\n> thinking machines have penetrated the scrambler shields, killed the\n> Magnus, enslaved the people, and every day their presence grows\n> stronger. There have to be Home Guard survivors fighting behind the\n> machine lines, and we know that another shield-generator station was\n> nearly completed. Perhaps that can be made functional! We must fight\n> back before the thinking machines can establish their own\n> infrastructure. If we wait, they will become unassailable!\"\n>\n> \"As far as we know, they are already unassailable,\" grumbled the\n> representative from industrial Vertree Colony.\n>\n> The Zanbar official added, \"Bringing the Armada to Giedi Prime would\n> be suicide. Without their scrambler shields, they have no defenses\n> left, and the machines would slaughter us in a direct conflict.\"\n>\n> Serena had jabbed a finger at the nervous audience. \"Not necessarily.\n> If we could slip in and finish the work at the secondary\n> shield-generating complex, then project a new blanket of disruptor\n> fields, we could cut off---\"\n>\n> The League members had actually laughed at the suggestion. Seeing her\n> heartbroken expression, Xavier felt stung on Serena's behalf. But she\n> had not understood the difficulty of her na\u00efve suggestion, the\n> impossibility of restoring Giedi Prime's shields under the noses of\n> the machine conquerors. During his planetary inspection tour, Xavier\n> had learned that it could take days or weeks for engineers--- working\n> under the best of conditions--- to make the backup shield system\n> operational.\n>\n> But Serena never stopped trying. The ache of imagining so many\n> suffering humans drove her to it.\n>\n> The vote had gone overwhelmingly against her. \"We cannot spend the\n> resources, firepower, or personnel on an ill-advised mission to a\n> planet we have already lost. It is now a machine stronghold.\" The\n> nobles feared for their own local defenses.\n>\n> Such work occupied most of Xavier's time. As an Armada officer, he had\n> gone to extended sessions with officers and Parliament\n> representatives, including Viceroy Butler. Xavier was determined to\n> learn what had gone wrong with Giedi Prime's defenses--- and whether\n> he was to blame in some way.\n>\n> Armada tacticians had studied the inspection records and assured him\n> that he could have done nothing to prevent the takeover, short of\n> stationing a full fleet of battleships at every League World. If\n> Omnius was willing to sacrifice part of his robotic attack force to\n> bring down Holtzman's scrambler shields, no planet was safe. But the\n> information didn't make Xavier feel much better.\n>\n> On Poritrin, Tio Holtzman was working hard to improve the scrambler\n> system design. Lord Bludd expressed his optimism and confidence in the\n> Savant, especially since the inventor had brought in another\n> mathematician, the daughter of the Sorceress Zufa Cenva, to assist\n> him. Xavier hoped something could be done quickly enough to make a\n> difference. . . .\n>\n> Lovely but harried, Serena entered the parlor and hugged him. \"I had\n> no idea you were coming.\" Octa slipped out the side door.\n>\n> Xavier looked at the ornate clock on the mantel. \"I wanted to surprise\n> you, but I have to get back to duty. I have a long meeting this\n> afternoon.\"\n>\n> She nodded, preoccupied. \"Since the attack on Giedi Prime, we've all\n> been prisoners of our planning sessions. I think I've lost track of\n> how many committees I serve.\"\n>\n> Teasingly, he said, \"Should I have been invited to this mysterious\n> gathering?\"\n>\n> Her chuckle sounded forced. \"Oh? The League Armada doesn't give you\n> enough work, so you'd like to sit in on my tedious meetings as well?\n> Perhaps I should speak to your new commander.\"\n>\n> \"No thank you, my dear. I'd rather fight ten cymeks than try to\n> dissuade you when you've set your mind to something.\" Serena responded\n> to his kiss with surprising passion. He stepped back, breathing hard,\n> and straightened his uniform. \"I need to go.\"\n>\n> \"Can I make it up to you at dinner tonight? A little t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, just\n> the two of us?\" Her eyes sparkled. \"It's important to me, especially\n> now.\"\n>\n> \"I'll be there.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WITH A SIGH of relief after quelling Xavier's suspicions, Serena\n> returned to the Winter Sun Room where her team had gathered. She wiped\n> a sparkle of sweat from her forehead. Several faces turned toward her,\n> and she raised a hand to allay concerns.\n>\n> Late morning sunlight splashed across the chairs, the tile counters\n> and a breakfast table now strewn with plans, maps, and resource\n> charts. \"We've got to get back to work,\" said the grizzled veteran Ort\n> Wibsen. \"Don't have much time if you want to put this in motion.\"\n>\n> \"That is absolutely my intention, Commander Wibsen. Anybody with\n> doubts should have left us days ago.\"\n>\n> Serena's father believed that she spent her mornings in the bright,\n> cheery room just reading, but for weeks she had been exploring schemes\n> . . .\n>\n> gathering volunteers, expert personnel, and raw materials. No one\n> could stop Serena Butler from devoting her energies to humanitarian\n> work.\n>\n> \"I tried to follow proper channels and make the League take action,\"\n> she said, \"but sometimes people must be coerced into making the right\n> decision. They must be led to it, like a stubborn Salusan stallion.\"\n>\n> After the Parliament laughed at her \"na\u00efve foolishness,\" Serena had\n> marched out of the temporary meeting hall but did not accept defeat.\n> She\n>\n> decided to change tactics, even if she had to organize and finance a\n> mission herself.\n>\n> When Xavier learned of her plan, after it was too late to stop her,\n> she hoped he would be proud of her.\n>\n> Now she studied the team she had gathered from the Armada's most\n> overlooked experts in commando operations: captains, supply runners,\n> even infiltration specialists. Ten men and women turned to look at\n> her. She clicked a remote control switch to close the overhead\n> louvers. The brightness of the room diminished, though muted sunlight\n> continued to filter in.\n>\n> \"If we can reclaim Giedi Prime, it will be twice the moral victory\n> that the machines had,\" Serena said. \"We will show that they cannot\n> hold us.\"\n>\n> Wibsen looked as if he had never ceased fighting, though he had been\n> off active duty for over a decade. \"All of us are more than happy to\n> tackle a task that will have tangible results. I've been itching to\n> strike a blow against the damned machines.\"\n>\n> Ort Wibsen was an old space commander who had been forced to retire---\n> ostensibly because of his age. More likely it had to do with his\n> coarse personality, a penchant for arguing with superiors, and history\n> of ignoring the details of orders. In spite of his surliness he was\n> exactly the man Serena needed to lead a mission that other League\n> members would have declared insane, or at least unwise.\n>\n> \"Then this is your chance, Commander,\" she said.\n>\n> Pinquer Jibb, the curly-haired and still-haggard-looking messenger who\n> had fled the conquest of Giedi Prime to deliver his terrible news, sat\n> stiff-backed, looking around the room. \"I've provided you with all the\n> background material you need. I've compiled detailed reports. The\n> subsidiary shield-generator station was nearly finished when the\n> machines attacked the planet. We merely need to slip in and get it\n> running.\" His haunted eyes grew fiery. \"Plenty members of the Giedi\n> Home Guard must\n>\n> have survived. They'll be doing everything they can behind enemy\n> lines, but that won't be enough unless we help them.\"\n>\n> \"If we can get the secondary shield generators functional, the cymeks\n> and robots on the surface will fall to a concerted defense from the\n> Armada.\" She scanned the others in the room. \"Do you think we'll be\n> able to do that?\"\n>\n> Brigit Paterson, a masculine-looking woman, frowned. \"What makes you\n> think the Armada will join the fight? After my engineers get the job\n> done, how will we make sure the military comes in to save our butts?\"\n>\n> Serena gave her a grim smile. \"You leave that to me.\"\n>\n> Serena had been raised with the best schools and tutors, groomed to\n> become a leader. With so much that needed to be done, she could not\n> sit in a comfortable manor house and fail to use the Butler wealth and\n> power.\n>\n> Now she was about to put that determination to the test. \"Commander\n> Wibsen, do you have the information I requested?\"\n>\n> With his deeply creased face and rough voice, the veteran seemed more\n> like a man of the outdoors than an intricate strategist. But no one in\n> Zimia knew more about military operations than he did.\n>\n> \"Some of it's good, some of it's bad. After crushing the government in\n> Giedi City, the machines kept a robot fleet in orbit. Mop-up work on\n> the ground is being led by one Titan and a lot of neo-cymeks.\" He\n> coughed, scowled, and adjusted a medication dispenser implanted in his\n> sternum.\n>\n> \"Omnius can keep sending in more machines, or even manufacture\n> reinforcements using the captured industries of Giedi Prime,\" said\n> Pinquer Jibb, his voice urgent. \"Unless we get the secondary shield\n> complex working.\"\n>\n> \"Then that's what we have to do,\" Serena said. \"The Home Guard was\n> dispersed across the settled continent, and many of the outlying\n> regiments\n>\n> seem to have gone underground to form a fifth column. If we can\n> contact them, organize them, we might be able to damage the machine\n> conquerors.\"\n>\n> \"I can help with that,\" Jibb insisted. \"It's our only chance.\"\n>\n> \"I still think it's foolhardy,\" Wibsen said. \"But what the hell. I\n> didn't say I wasn't going to go.\"\n>\n> \"Is the ship ready?\" Serena asked, impatient.\n>\n> \"It is, but there's a great deal lacking in this operation, if you ask\n> me.\"\n>\n> Brigit Paterson said to Serena, \"I have secured detailed maps, plans,\n> and blueprints of all aspects of Giedi Prime and Giedi City, including\n> full functional diagrams of the subsidiary scrambler-shield\n> generators.\" She extended a stack of thin film sheets densely packed\n> with information. \"Pinquer says they're up to date.\"\n>\n> With boundless enthusiasm and passion, Serena had always demonstrated\n> skill in putting things together. Two years ago, she had led a relief\n> team to Caladan, an Unallied Planet where thousands of refugees from\n> the Synchronized Worlds had fled. On her most recent crusade, a year\n> ago, she had delivered three space transports full of medical supplies\n> to closed-off Tlulax, where the inhabitants were suffering from\n> mysterious diseases. Now that Tlulaxa flesh merchants had provided\n> medical aid and replacement organs from their biological tanks---\n> including saving her beloved Xavier--- she felt that her investment in\n> effort had paid off fully.\n>\n> Now Serena had called in favors, resulting in a mission that bore some\n> similiarities to her earlier successful efforts. She expected another\n> clear success, despite the dangers.\n>\n> With beatific confidence, Serena looked around the table again. She\n> envisioned the mission succeeding. Eleven people willing to challenge\n> a set of conquerors and overcome the odds. \"We have no higher\n> priorities.\"\n>\n> Ort Wibsen had worked between traditional channels to obtain a fast\n> blockade runner. Paterson's engineering crew had equipped the vessel\n> with the best experimental materials she could scavenge from weapons\n> manufactories. Using personal accounts and falsified documentation,\n> Serena had funded whatever the old commander needed. She wanted the\n> best possible chance for her impetuous mission to succeed.\n>\n> Serena said, \"Every person in the League has lost someone to the\n> thinking-machine onslaught, and now we're going to do something about\n> it.\"\n>\n> \"Let's get busy then,\" Pinquer Jibb said. \"Time for payback.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> THAT EVENING, ALONE in the grand dining hall, Serena and Xavier sat\n> across from each another. Servers bustled back and forth in\n> red-and-gold jackets and black trousers.\n>\n> As he sampled golden duckling fillets on his plate, Xavier talked\n> excitedly about Armada mobilization plans and methods of protecting\n> the League Worlds.\n>\n> \"Let's not talk business tonight.\" With a charming smile, Serena rose\n> to her feet and glided around the table, taking a seat next to him,\n> very close. \"I savor each moment with you, Xavier,\" she said, giving\n> nothing away about her plan.\n>\n> He smiled back at her. \"After the poison gas, I can't savor much else.\n> But you, Serena, are better than the finest banquet or the sweetest\n> perfume.\"\n>\n> Stroking his cheek, she said, \"I think we should tell the servants to\n> go to their quarters. My father is in the city and my sister is gone\n> for the evening. Should we waste this time alone?\"\n>\n> He reached out to brush her arm, then drew her close and grinned. \"I'm\n> not hungry anyway.\"\n>\n> \"I am.\" Passionately, she kissed his ear, then his cheek, finally\n> finding his mouth. He ran his fingers through her hair, touching the\n> back of her head and kissing her more deeply.\n>\n> They left the remnants of the fine meal on the table. She took his\n> hand and together they hurried to her chambers. The door was heavy,\n> and locked easily. She already had a fire lit in the fireplace, giving\n> the room an orange, cheery glow. They kissed again and again, trying\n> to unfasten laces and buttons and clips without breaking apart from\n> each other.\n>\n> Serena could barely control her urgency, not just to feel his intimate\n> touch, but to etch every sensation into her mind. He did not know that\n> she intended to slip away afterward, and she needed something to\n> remember about this night, to compensate for the time they would be\n> apart.\n>\n> His fingers were like fire as they traced down her naked back. She\n> could think of nothing but the moment as she pulled off his shirt.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WITH THE MEMORY of her lover's embrace still tingling along the nerves\n> of her body, Serena left the sleeping manor. She set out into the\n> quiet depths of night, bound to rendezvous with her team at a private\n> field on the outskirts of the Zimia spaceport.\n>\n> Anxious to be away, her optimism subduing her anxiety, Serena joined\n> her ten commando volunteers. Within the hour they departed in a fast,\n> cloud-gray blockade runner loaded with engineering tools, weapons, and\n> hope.\n>\n> *Religion, time and time again, brings down empires, rotting them from\n> within.*\n>\n> --- IBLIS GINJO,\n\nrearly planning for the Jihad\n\n> **T**he conquered planet Earth seemed to be a dumping ground for\n> grandiose monuments that celebrated the fictitious glories of the\n> Titans.\n>\n> Gazing from his vantage at yet another huge construction project\n> designed by the prideful imaginations of the cymeks, the crew leader\n> paced along a high wooden platform. His people were good workers,\n> dedicated to him--- but the work itself seemed pointless. When this\n> ornate pedestal was completed and shored up with reinforced arcs, it\n> would become the platform for a colossal statue representing the\n> idealized, long-lost human form of the Titan Ajax.\n>\n> As one of the most successful trustee humans on Earth, Iblis Ginjo\n> took his job very seriously. He scrutinized the throng of slaves\n> scurrying about below. He had convinced them to be enthusiastic,\n> drumming up their attentiveness through well-chosen phrases and\n> rewards . . . though Iblis hated to waste such loyalty and hard work\n> on a brutal bully such as Ajax.\n>\n> Still, every person had his part in the giant machine of civilization.\n> Iblis had to make sure there were no malfunctions, not on his watch.\n>\n> The crew leader was not required to be here; his subordinate trustees\n> could just as easily stand under the hot sun and supervise. But Iblis\n> preferred this to his other duties. Seeing him watch over them, the\n> slaves seemed to add a bit more to the tasks. He took pride in what\n> they could accomplish, if managed well, and they genuinely wanted to\n> please him.\n>\n> Otherwise, he would spend tedious hours involved in the processing of\n> new slaves and assigning them to various work crews. Often the\n> un-tamed ones\n>\n> needed special training, or resisted violently--- problems that\n> hindered the smooth flow of daily work.\n>\n> Erasmus, the strangely independent and eccentric robot, had recently\n> issued an order to inspect any *hrethgir* captives taken from newly\n> conquered Giedi Prime, in particular any human who showed qualities of\n> independence and leadership. Iblis would stay on the alert for a\n> suitable candidate . . . without drawing attention to himself.\n>\n> He didn't care about Omnius's goals for their own sake, but as a crew\n> leader he received certain considerations based on performance. Though\n> such perks made life tolerable, he distributed most of the rewards\n> among his crews.\n>\n> With a broad face and thick hair that fell across his brow, Iblis had\n> a strong, virile appearance. Able to get more work out of the slaves\n> than any other boss, he knew the best tools and incentives, the\n> manipulation of gentle promises rather than harsh threats. Food, rest\n> days, sexual services from the reproductive slaves--- whatever it took\n> to motivate them. He had even been asked to speak some of his thoughts\n> at the school for trustees, but his techniques were not widely adopted\n> among the other privileged humans.\n>\n> Most crew bosses relied on deprivation and torture, but Iblis\n> considered that a waste. He had risen to his position largely through\n> the force of his personality and the allegiance he engendered in his\n> slaves. Even difficult men invariably succumbed to his will. The\n> machines sensed this innate ability, so Omnius gave him the freedom to\n> do his work.\n>\n> At a glance, Iblis counted half a dozen monoliths around the hilltop\n> Forum, each pedestal containing the huge statue of one of the Twenty\n> Titans, beginning with Tlaloc, then Agamemnon, then Juno, Barbarossa,\n> Tamerlane, and Alexander. An immense likeness of Ajax would occupy the\n> one here, not because Ajax was so important, but because he was\n> violently impatient. Dante could wait, and Xerxes.\n>\n> Iblis couldn't remember the rest of the Titans off the top of his\n> head, but he always learned more than he wanted to know as each statue\n> was built. The\n>\n> work would never end. Iblis had been personally involved in every one\n> of the ostentatious sculptures over the past five years, first as a\n> construction slave and later as crew boss.\n>\n> It was late in the summer season, warmer than usual. Heat devils\n> danced off rooftops around the Forum. Directly under him on the dusty\n> ground, his construction crew wore drab browns, grays, and blacks---\n> durable clothing that required only occasional washing or repairs.\n>\n> Below Iblis's platform, a team boss bellowed out orders. Supervisory\n> robots moved about, making no move to assist the straining laborers.\n> Watcheyes floated overhead, recording everything for Omnius. Iblis\n> hardly noticed them anymore. Humans were industrious, ingenious,\n> and--- unlike machines--- flexible, as long as they were given\n> incentives and rewards, encouraged in the proper ways, guided to the\n> best behavior. The thinking machines could not understand the\n> subtleties, but Iblis knew that each minor reward he gave his workers\n> was an investment that paid off tenfold.\n>\n> According to tradition, the slaves often sang work songs and engaged\n> in boisterous team competitions; they were silent now, groaning as\n> they hauled structural blocks into place though in their habitation\n> hives, workers sometimes grumbled about the labor. The cymeks were\n> anxious to see the pedestal completed so they could erect the statue\n> of Ajax, which was being fabricated elsewhere by another crew. Each\n> segment of the project followed a rigid schedule, with no excuses\n> permitted for lateness or shoddy quality.\n>\n> For now, Iblis was glad his people could work in peace, without the\n> intimidating scrutiny of Ajax. Iblis did not know where the Titan\n> might be at the moment, but could only hope he would prey on other\n> hapless individuals today. Iblis had work to do and a schedule to\n> keep.\n>\n> In his opinion, the monoliths were useless--- huge obelisks, pillars,\n> statues, and Grogyptian facades for empty, unnecessary buildings. But\n> it was not his position to question such time-consuming projects.\n> Iblis knew full well that the monuments fulfilled an important\n> psychological need for the usurped\n>\n> tyrants. Besides, such work kept slaves busy and gave them visible\n> results of their labor.\n>\n> Following their humiliating overthrow by Omnius centuries ago, the\n> Titans had constantly scrambled to recover lost status. Iblis thought\n> the cymeks went overboard, building cyclopean statues and pyramids\n> just to make themselves feel more important. They strutted around in\n> showy but old-fashioned machine bodies, bragging about military\n> conquests.\n>\n> Iblis wondered how much of it was really true. After all, how could\n> anyone question those who controlled history? The wild humans in the\n> unruly League worlds probably had a different view of the conquests.\n>\n> He wiped sweat from his brow and smelled the gritty dust that rose\n> from the work below. He looked at the electronic notepad in his hand,\n> checking the progress against the schedule tally. Everything was\n> proceeding well, as expected.\n>\n> With his sharp eyes, he spotted a man leaning against a shaded wall,\n> taking an unauthorized rest. With a smile, Iblis pointed an\n> \"encourager\" pulse weapon at him and skimmed the man's left leg with a\n> beam of energy. The slave slapped the hot spot on his skin and whirled\n> to look up at Iblis.\n>\n> \"Are you trying to make me look bad?\" Iblis yelled. \"What if Ajax came\n> around and saw you falling asleep there? Would he kill you first, or\n> me?\"\n>\n> Abashed, the man shouldered his way into the crowd of sweating\n> laborers, where he resumed his work with renewed vigor.\n>\n> Some work bosses found it necessary to kill slaves as examples to the\n> others, but Iblis had never resorted to that tactic and vowed that he\n> never would. He was certain it would break the inexplicable spell he\n> had over the men. Instead, he only had to show disappointment in them,\n> and they worked harder.\n>\n> Every few days he delivered stirring, impromptu speeches. On such\n> occasions the slaves received water and rest breaks, giving them\n> renewed\n>\n> energy that more than made up for the time spent. The way he strung\n> phrases together often brought cheers and enthusiasm, and only a few\n> questions from bold slaves who wondered why they should be excited\n> about yet another monument. The work leader's talent lay in being\n> utterly *convincing*.\n>\n> Iblis hated the machine overlords, but concealed his feelings so\n> effectively that his superiors actually trusted him. Now, in a\n> fanciful moment, he envisioned destroying the computer evermind and\n> installing himself in its place. Much more than a mere trustee. Think\n> of it--- Iblis Ginjo, ruler of all, knower of all!\n>\n> He caught himself and dispelled the foolish daydream. Reality was a\n> harsh teacher, like the sight of a cymek on a beautiful day. If Iblis\n> didn't complete the obelisk pedestal in time, Ajax would devise an\n> extravagant punishment for them all.\n>\n> The work leader didn't dare fall behind schedule.\n\n*Each of us influences the actions of the people we know.*\n\n--- XAVIER HARKONNEN,\n\ncomment to his men\n\n> **F**or days, Tercero Xavier Harkonnen stayed up late working on\n> defensive plans for the League. Since his sweet night with Serena--- a\n> sparkling promise of their future--- he had devoted himself to the\n> protection of free humanity.\n>\n> On Salusa he flew practice missions, drilled new fighters, increased\n> the number of picket ships on the system's perimeter for a stronger\n> first defense, and extended the scanning network to provide a better\n> early-warning capability from deep space. Engineers and scientists\n> dismantled and studied the warrior-forms abandoned by the cymeks and\n> left behind in the ruins of Zimia, hoping to find flaws or weaknesses.\n> With each breath in his replacement lungs, he felt outrage against the\n> thinking machines.\n>\n> He wanted to spend more time with Serena, dreaming of where they would\n> go after the wedding, but driven by anger and private guilt about\n> Giedi Prime, Xavier buried himself in work. If he had concentrated on\n> the primary mission there, rather than mooning like a lovesick\n> schoolboy, he might have noticed the defensive flaw and helped the\n> Magnus to prepare. Even encouraging the immediate completion of the\n> secondary shield generator would have made all the difference. But it\n> was too late now.\n>\n> Seemingly inconsequential mistakes could lead to huge events. Xavier\n> promised himself that he would never lapse in his duties again, not\n> for any reason. If that meant spending less time with Serena, she\n> would understand.\n>\n> Emergency staff meetings resulted in a revision of the military\n> structure of the Armada, combining the resources and numerous warship\n> designs from all the planetary militias and home guards. The special\n> defensive needs and tactical significance of each League World were\n> discussed in detail.\n>\n> Armada recruitment surged to new levels. Manufactories worked overtime\n> to provide ships and weapons.\n>\n> Xavier hoped it would be enough.\n>\n> In his office on the top floor of the Joint Staff Building, electronic\n> star maps covered the walls. Printed charts and reports cluttered\n> every work surface. Each step of the way, he obtained the approval of\n> the Joint Staff Commander, who in turn reviewed key elements with\n> Viceroy Butler.\n>\n> When he slept at all, Xavier did so in his office or in the\n> underground barracks. For days he did not return home to the Tantor\n> estate, though his mother often sent eager young Vergyl to deliver\n> meals made especially for him.\n>\n> Oddly, he had not heard from Serena, and assumed the Viceroy's\n> daughter was occupied with vital duties of her own. The two young\n> lovers were alike in their ability to see large-scale priorities . . .\n> and in their independence.\n>\n> Determined to revamp League defenses, Xavier kept himself going with\n> stimulant capsules and drinks. He rarely noted what time of day or\n> night it was, heeding only the next meeting on his schedule. Now he\n> blinked through his office window at the quiet streets and the city\n> lights glittering in the darkness. How long had it been night time?\n> The hours merged with each other, carrying him along like a pebble in\n> a landslide.\n>\n> In the final tally, how much could one man actually accomplish? Were\n> some League Worlds already doomed, no matter what he did? Because of\n> the distances between planets and slow space travel, communication was\n> sluggish, and news was often stale by the time it reached Salusa\n> Secundus.\n>\n> His reliance on stimulants made him feel scratchy and ragged. He was\n> awake, but so pummeled by fatigue that he could no longer focus. He\n> heaved a huge sigh, staring blankly. At the side of the office, his\n> adjutant, Cuarto Jaymes Powder, had cleared a spot on a table and\n> rested his head on the polished wood.\n>\n> When the door opened, Cuarto Powder did not stir, or even snore, but\n> continued sleeping like the dead. Xavier was surprised to see Viceroy\n> Butler stride in, also weary to the core. \"We need to implement\n> whatever you've got ready, Xavier. Funding is guaranteed. For the sake\n> of morale, the people must *see* us doing something.\"\n>\n> \"I know, but we need more than one solution, sir. Have Lord Bludd\n> encourage Savant Holtzman to present any preliminary concepts he has\n> under development.\" He rubbed his eyes. \"If nothing else, we need new\n> options for our arsenal.\"\n>\n> \"We already talked about that last night, Xavier--- at great length.\"\n> The Viceroy looked at him strangely. \"Don't you remember? He has\n> several prototype units almost ready.\"\n>\n> \"Yes . . . of course. I was just reminding you.\"\n>\n> Xavier crossed the room and sat at an interactive information screen,\n> a high-security system that flirted with the dangers of a computer.\n> The electronic summary system could organize and provide vital data,\n> but had no self-awareness. Many nobles--- especially Bludd of\n> Poritrin--- resented the use of even such crude computers, but in\n> times such as these, the summary systems were vital.\n>\n> Passing his hand over the screen, Xavier made adjustments in his\n> report to Parliament, including a compendium of planet-specific\n> appendices, then printed the document, copies of which would be sent\n> to each League World. Presently he handed a neat stack to the Viceroy,\n> who perused the recommendations and signed his approval with a\n> flourish. Then Serena's father hurried out of the office, leaving the\n> door open behind him.\n>\n> At the table, Cuarto Powder stirred and sat up, bleary-eyed. Without a\n> word, Xavier settled into the chair at his own desk. Across the room,\n> the summary screen flashed in an aurora of light as technicians filled\n> it with probing signals to make certain the system exhibited no glints\n> of artificial intelligence.\n>\n> As his aide drifted off again, Xavier dozed as well. In his groggy\n> imagination he dreamed that Serena Butler was missing, along with a\n> ship and military team. It seemed surreal to him, but plausible . . .\n> then he realized with a start that he was not asleep at all anymore.\n>\n> Powder stood at his desk with another officer, listening to the bad\n> news. \"She's taken a blockade-runner, sir! Modified it with expensive\n> armor and weaponry. She has a group of commandos with her. An old\n> veteran, Ort Wibsen, agreed to lead them.\"\n>\n> Xavier struggled to throw off the confusion induced by weariness.\n> After rubbing his scratchy eyes he was surprised to see Serena's\n> wide-eyed sister Octa standing behind the men. In a pale hand she held\n> a gleaming black diamond necklace dangling from a coil of gold, which\n> she hurriedly handed to him.\n>\n> \"Serena told me to wait five days, and then give this to you.\" Octa\n> seemed ethereal, delicate; she moved to his side, but would not meet\n> his gaze.\n>\n> Searching for answers, Xavier removed the necklace from the coil. When\n> he touched the black diamonds, the perspiration on his hand activated\n> a tiny projector that showed a small holo image of Serena. He stared\n> at her, feeling astonishment and dread. The visual seemed to look\n> directly at him.\n>\n> \"Xavier, my love, I have gone to Giedi Prime. The League would have\n> argued the issue for months, while the conquered people suffer. I\n> can't permit that.\" Her smile was heartbreaking, but hopeful. \"I have\n> a team of the best engineers, commandos, and infiltration specialists.\n> We have all the equipment and expertise we need to slip in and\n> activate the secondary shield transmitter. We will complete the\n> construction and install the systems\n>\n> --- enabling us to cut off the planet from thinking machine ships,\n> while trapping the ones that are already there on the surface. You\n> must bring in the Armada and recapture this world. We're counting on\n> you. Think of how much we can help humanity!\"\n>\n> Xavier was unable to believe what he was hearing. The image of Serena\n> continued to speak her recorded message. \"I will be waiting there,\n> Xavier. I\n>\n> know you won't let me down.\"\n>\n> Xavier clenched his hands until his knuckles whitened. If anyone could\n> accomplish such a surprising mission, it was Serena Butler. She was\n> impetuous, but at least she was trying to do something. And she knew\n> her decision would force the rest of them to act.\n>\n> Octa began crying softly at his side. Viceroy Butler rushed into the\n> office, appalled at what he had heard.\n>\n> \"That's just like her,\" Xavier said. \"Now we have to rally a\n> response--- there's no choice.\"\n>\n> *Think of war as behavior.*\n\n--- GENERAL AGAMEMNON,\n\n*Memoirs*\n\n> **I**n an arena under the harsh sunlight of Earth's equatorial zone,\n> Agamemnon prepared to battle Omnius's gladiator machine. The evermind\n> treated these mock combats as challenges for the subservient Titans, a\n> way for them to vent their anger and keep them preoccupied. But\n> Agamemnon saw it as an opportunity to strike hard against his real\n> enemy.\n>\n> Two hundred and thirty years ago, human slaves and contractor robots\n> had completed this semicircular, open-roofed coliseum for Omnius's\n> flashy battles. The evermind enjoyed testing the destructive\n> capabilities of different robotic designs. Here, armored vehicles and\n> self-aware artillery systems could clash under controlled\n> circumstances.\n>\n> Long ago, the genius Barbarossa had programmed an appreciation for\n> combat and a thirst for conquest into the artificial intelligence that\n> had evolved into Omnius. Even a thousand years later the computer\n> evermind had never forgotten his taste for victory.\n>\n> Sometimes these staged competitions pitted humans against machines.\n> Randomly selected slaves from work gangs were given clubs, explosives,\n> or cutting beams and thrown into the arena to face combat robots. The\n> irrational violence of desperate humans never ceased to challenge the\n> calculating mind of Omnius. At other times, the omnipresent computer\n> preferred to demonstrate his own superiority against his cymeks.\n>\n> In anticipation of the next gladiatorial challenge, Agamemnon had\n> spent considerable effort in designing his new combat body. Omnius\n> sometimes pitted his sleekest, most sophisticated models against the\n> Titans; on other occasions, he responded with absurdly massive\n> monstrosities that would never have been viable in any real struggle.\n> It was all for show.\n>\n> Months ago, when Barbarossa had achieved a particularly fine victory\n> against Omnius, the cymek had demanded permission to attack the feral\n> humans as a reward. While the strike on Salusa Secundus had not gone\n> well, the Titans' second effort had conquered Giedi Prime. Barbarossa\n> was even now overseeing dozens of neo-cymeks in the subjugation of the\n> people there, a Titan once more in charge of a world. At last, it was\n> a step in the right direction . . .\n>\n> If he succeeded in winning in the arena today, Agamemnon had plans of\n> his own.\n>\n> With sirens blaring to announce the new event, Agamemnon rolled\n> forward on resilient walker pads and passed between the Corinthian\n> columns of Challenger's Gate. He could feel the thrumming strength of\n> his stepped-up mobility systems, the pulse of increased power surging\n> through his neurelectric pathways.\n>\n> Inside this gladiator-form, his low-slung body core consisted of a\n> pair of reinforced spheres--- one surrounded by opaque armor, the\n> other made of transparent alloyglas. Within the clear globe hung the\n> grayish white hemispheres of his human brain, drifting in a pale-blue\n> electrafluid and connected to thoughtrodes. Faint photon discharges\n> crackled along the cerebral lobes as the cymek body moved forward,\n> ready to fight.\n>\n> Around the double-sphere core, bulky drive motors hummed inside\n> protective cowlings. Engines worked the smooth hydraulics of four\n> grappling legs. Each articulated limb ended with a shifting mass of\n> adaptable metal polymer that could shape itself into a variety of\n> hardened weapons.\n>\n> Agamemnon had constructed this ferocious gladiator-form under the\n> buzzing gaze of watcheyes that monitored his every move. Omnius\n> supposedly filed all such information in a segregated portion of his\n> evermind, so as not to gain an unfair combat advantage. Or so Omnius\n> claimed.\n>\n> While Agamemnon waited, poised for battle, his opponent strode\n> forward, controlled directly by the evermind. Omnius had selected a\n> walking suit of exaggerated medieval armor: two massive legs with feet\n> like the foundations of a building and arms that ended in gauntleted\n> fists as large as the body core itself. The proportions were grossly\n> exaggerated, like a child's nightmare of a bully. Spikes extruded from\n> the massive knuckles on Omnius's goliath robot, and apocalyptic\n> discharges arced from point to point on the thorny fist.\n>\n> Agamemnon pushed forward on armored walker pads while raising his\n> crablike forelimbs, the adaptable-polymer ends of each morphing into\n> claws. Even if he won the contest today, the evermind would suffer\n> nothing, would not even have the grace to be humiliated in defeat.\n>\n> On the other hand, Omnius could accidentally destroy the Titan's brain\n> canister. Unforseen things happened in battle situations, and maybe\n> Omnius\n>\n> --- despite his programming that prevented him from intentionally\n> killing a Titan--- was counting on that. For Agamemnon, this fight was\n> for real.\n>\n> A few designated robotic observers watched from the stands through\n> enhanced optic threads, but they remained silent. Agamemnon did not\n> require applause anyway. The other polished stone seats in the\n> coliseum remained empty, reflecting daylight from the open sky. The\n> large stadium, like an echoing tomb, had all the room necessary for\n> two gigantic foes to clash.\n>\n> No announcement preceded the fight, no information piped over\n> loudspeakers. Agamemnon launched his attack first.\n>\n> The Titan raised his whiplike grappling arms, hardened them with a\n> shifting diamond film, and drove forward on heavy walker pads. With\n> surprising agility, Omnius's goliath robot lifted an enormous leg and\n> sidestepped the attack.\n>\n> Agamemnon lunged with another of his forelimbs, this one capped with a\n> spherical wrecking ball that fired disruptive, paralyzing energy. The\n> pulse thrummed through vulnerable systems, and Omnius's warrior\n> shuddered.\n>\n> Suddenly the goliath swiveled, raising a gauntleted fist to smash the\n> cymek's segmented arm. Even the diamond film could not endure the\n> blow, which bent Agamemnon's forelimb until it ripped from the\n> flexible socket. The cymek dismissed the damage and reversed his\n> walker pads, ejecting the unsalvageable limb. He swung up a cutting\n> arm that metamorphosed into a flurry of shimmering diamond blades.\n>\n> Agamemnon sawed through his opponent's armored torso, severing a set\n> of neurelectric control threads. Greenish fluid sprayed out from\n> chopped lubricant channels. The combat goliath swung his other spiked\n> fist, but Agamemnon danced his walker pads sideways and shifted his\n> vulnerable body core, keeping the brain canister safe.\n>\n> When his swing missed completely, the heavy blow overbalanced the\n> gladiator robot. Agamemnon brought up two slicing arms, hacking at the\n> goliath's arm joints with white-hot cutting irons. He found vulnerable\n> spots with surprising ease, and the goliath's right arm dangled\n> useless, a tangle of neurelectric fibers and conductive fluids.\n>\n> To assess the damage, Omnius dragged his unwieldy fighter two\n> thundering steps backward. Agamemnon pressed his advantage, closing to\n> grappling distance. Then he unleashed his first major surprise.\n>\n> From a concealed compartment within the old-fashioned engine housing,\n> a trapdoor irised open, and eight reinforced conductor-fiber cables\n> sprang out, each tipped with a magnetic connector claw. The cables\n> flew like a nest of startled vipers and slammed into the reeling\n> goliath. As soon as the tips struck home, Agamemnon released a huge\n> energy discharge. Lightning flared up and down the massive body of\n> Omnius's fighter.\n>\n> The cymek general expected this insidious blow to knock the combat\n> robot completely offline, but Omnius must have shielded his fighting\n> unit well. Agamemnon sent another paralytic pulse like a scorpion's\n> sting, but still the Omnius gladiator did not fall. Instead, as if in\n> anger, the machine swung its mammoth gauntlet with the force of a\n> colliding train, putting all of his energy and momentum behind a\n> single blow.\n>\n> The spiked fist struck true, slamming into the transparent\n> preservation sphere that held the disembodied brain. A major jamming\n> surge pulsed out of the knuckle spikes, and a shaped fracture wave\n> shattered the curved glass walls of the protected brain canister.\n> Through the breached container walls, electrafluid spilled like blue\n> gushing blood. Thoughtrodes tore, and the brain fell from its\n> suspender wires, dangling naked in the open, hot air.\n>\n> It might have been the death of Agamemnon.\n>\n> But the cymek general had devised his own trick. The brain inside the\n> transparent container was only a decoy, a synthetic reproduction of\n> his cerebral contours. Agamemnon's actual brain was inside the opaque\n> metal-walled sphere, from which he controlled the gladiator-form. Safe\n> and intact.\n>\n> He was, however, astonished and infuriated. Omnius had proven his\n> willingness to inflict severe damage on the most powerful and talented\n> Titan of all. Omnius's strong urge to avoid losing seemed capable of\n> overriding his programming restrictions. Or had the evermind known\n> about the ruse all along? Agamemnon launched his vindictive response.\n>\n> Even as he spun backward on his walker pads, roaring away as fast as\n> possible, he ejected the now-cracked sphere that contained the false\n> brain. He launched it into the body core of the goliath robot.\n>\n> In his specially constructed body, Agamemnon then ducked down, raising\n> his armored limbs and lowering his shielded brain canister between the\n> rows of thick walker pads to protect himself, like a turtle\n> withdrawing into a shell.\n>\n> The brain sphere struck the damaged gladiator and detonated. The\n> simulated brain had been sculpted from high-energy solid foam. Flames\n> roared past Agamemnon, charring the ground. The resulting explosion\n> bowled over the goliath robot, decapitating it, ripping open its\n> torso. The shockwave was sufficient to knock down part of the nearest\n> coliseum wall.\n>\n> Agamemnon had survived--- and the Omnius gladiator had fallen.\n>\n> \"Excellent, General!\" The computer voice echoed from loudspeakers in\n> the intact portion of the arena, sounding genuinely pleased. \"A most\n> refreshing and enjoyable maneuver.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon still wondered if Omnius had been aware that the visible\n> brain was false. Or perhaps the evermind had found a way to circumvent\n> the protective restrictions Barbarossa had installed so many years\n> ago. Now he would never be sure if the evermind was indeed willing to\n> let him die in combat. Maybe Omnius had to keep the ambitious Titans\n> from feeling too triumphant or overvalued, especially Agamemnon.\n>\n> Only Omnius knew for certain, one way or the other.\n>\n> Amid the smoke and flames rising from the ruin of the goliath machine,\n> Agamemnon raised his gladiator-form, the uncontested victor. \"I have\n> defeated you, Omnius. I wish to claim my reward.\"\n>\n> \"Naturally, General,\" he answered, sounding good-natured. \"You need\n> not even speak your wish. Yes, I shall allow you and your cymeks to\n> lead further strikes against the *hrethgir*. Go forth and enjoy\n> yourselves.\"\n>\n> *Survivors learn to adapt.*\n\n--- ZUFA CENVA,\n\nlecture to Sorceresses\n\n> **I**n the pristine, contoured cabin of the *Dream Voyager*, Vorian\n> Atreides and Seurat cruised between star systems again, picking up and\n> delivering Omnius updates to maintain congruence in the distributed\n> evermind across all the Synchronized Worlds. They exchanged updates\n> with other copies of the evermind, synchronizing the Omnius\n> incarnations, and departing with new data to be shared among the\n> widespread networks. Vor loved being a trustee.\n>\n> Days in space passed, each like the others. The oddly matched pair\n> performed their jobs efficiently. Seurat and the small cadre of\n> maintenance drones assured sterile cleanliness and optimal efficiency\n> in the cabins, while Vor occasionally left food or drink stains,\n> leaving a few items half-finished or in disarray.\n>\n> As he often did, Vor stood at an interactive console in the cramped\n> rear compartment, rummaging in the ship's database to obtain more\n> information about their destinations. He had been taught the benefits\n> of bettering himself in his training among the other privileged humans\n> on Earth. His father's example--- rising from an unknown man to become\n> the greatest of the Titans, conqueror of the Old Empire--- showed him\n> how much even a mere human could accomplish.\n>\n> He was surprised to see that the *Dream Voyager*'s normal route had\n> changed. \"Seurat! Why didn't you tell me we've added a new planet?\n> I've never heard of this . . . Giedi Prime in the Ophiuchi B system.\n> Previously it was listed as a solid League World.\"\n>\n> \"Omnius programmed that destination into our course before we departed\n> from Earth. He expected that your father would have conquered it by\n> the\n>\n> time we arrive. Omnius is confident in Agamemnon's ability to make\n> good after their failure on Salusa Secundus.\"\n>\n> Vor felt pride that his father would tame yet another unruly world for\n> the thinking machines. \"No doubt all will have gone well by the time\n> we arrive, and our forces will be mopping up.\"\n>\n> \"We will see when we get there,\" Seurat said. \"It is still months\n> away.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> ON MANY OCCASIONS they engaged in traditional human competitions from\n> the extensive databases, such as poker or backgammon; other times\n> Vorian would make up a new game, declare a set of absurd rules, and\n> then proceed to defeat Seurat, until the autonomous robot learned to\n> manipulate the rules for himself.\n>\n> The two were evenly matched, but with drastically different skill\n> sets. While Seurat was talented at intricate strategy and could\n> calculate many moves ahead, Vor often pulled off baffling innovative\n> twists to win.

There is\n> no causal connection.\"\n>\n> Vor smiled at him. \"I'd hate to see you calculate an 'irrational'\n> response, old Metalmind. Leave it to the experts, like me.\"\n>\n> The son of Agamemnon was also quite proficient at military tactics and\n> strategies, a skill he had developed by studying the great battles of\n> ancient human history, as summarized in his father's extensive\n> memoirs. The cymek general made no secret that he hoped his son would\n> become an accomplished military genius one day.\n>\n> Whenever Seurat fell behind in a particular contest, he continued his\n> irritating habit of distracting Vor with jokes, trivia, or\n> anecdotes--- tailoring them to interest the brash young man. During\n> all the time the machine\n>\n> captain had known his human copilot, Seurat had accumulated and\n> assessed information, preparing it for future use. The robot captain\n> had become adept at raising topics that engrossed Vor and sent his\n> thoughts spinning.\n>\n> Seurat chattered incessantly about the legendary life of Agamemnon,\n> adding details Vor had never read in the memoirs: great battles the\n> Titans had won, planets they had added to the Synchronized Worlds, and\n> the warrior-forms Agamemnon had designed for private gladiatorial\n> contests. Once, the robot captain concocted an absurd tale about how\n> the great general had literally lost his mind. The cymek's protected\n> brain canister had accidentally detached from its walker-form and gone\n> tumbling down a hill, while the mechanical body, on automatic\n> programming, had to scamper about and find it.\n>\n> However, Vorian had recently uncovered information more unsettling\n> than anything the robot could ever reveal. Between games and\n> challenges, he often skimmed the open databases, reading his favorite\n> parts of his father's memoirs, trying to make sense of the reams of\n> Omnius's minutiae. On one of those excursions Vor discovered that over\n> the years, Agamemnon had sired twelve other sons. Vorian had never\n> assumed he was the only one--- but a dozen unknown brothers! The great\n> Titan general would naturally have wanted to create descendants worthy\n> of his legacy.\n>\n> Worse, he discovered that each of those dozen sons had proved to be a\n> failure. Agamemnon did not suffer disappointments gladly, and had\n> killed his unacceptable offspring, though they had been privileged\n> trustees just like Vor. The last had been executed nearly a century\n> ago. Now Vor was his father's best hope, but not necessarily the only\n> choice. Agamemnon must still have more sperm in storage . . . and thus\n> Vor was just as expendable as the others.\n>\n> After learning that, Vor became immune to Seurat's attempts at\n> distraction.\n>\n> Now Vor sat at the table, staring at a projected game board and\n> considering his next move. He knew Seurat could not determine what was\n> going on inside the unpredictable human mind. Even with all his\n> independent\n>\n> sophistication, the robot accumulated only external data and did not\n> recognize subtleties.\n>\n> The trustee smiled, just a little, which Seurat did not fail to\n> notice. \"You are playing a little trick on me? Exercising some secret\n> human power?\"\n>\n> Vor continued to smile and stare at the board. It was a multigame\n> competition, revolving inside a three-dimensional screen embedded in\n> the tabletop. Each player attempted to choose a contest or situation\n> that benefited him from a wide selection of games, and then make a\n> move. The score was tied, and the next point would win the contest.\n>\n> The various games came up at random, and each time Vor had only a few\n> seconds to make his move. He watched the shifting graphics as they\n> locked into place momentarily before moving on. The ancient Terran\n> game of Go appeared on the palette of selections; nothing there to\n> benefit him. More options flowed by. A machine-biased game appeared\n> next, one that required more memory than Vor had. He let it pass. Two\n> other games appeared that he didn't like, followed by a poker hand.\n>\n> Relying on luck and bluster, Vor faced off against the robot captain,\n> who could not understand the strategy of bluffing or the \"skill\" of\n> random odds. Vor's expression was unreadable, and he laughed at the\n> confusion he saw on Seurat's mirrored face.\n>\n> \"You lost,\" Vor said. \"And you lost, badly.\" He crossed his arms over\n> his chest, feeling smug after the robot finally folded his hand. \"It's\n> not just the score, but the way you tried to win.\"\n>\n> Seurat responded that he did not wish to play more games, and Vor\n> laughed at him. \"You're sulking, old Metalmind!\"\n>\n> \"I am reassessing my tactics.\"\n>\n> Vor reached across the table and pounded his opponent's slick\n> shoulder, as if to comfort him. \"Why don't you stay here and practice,\n> while I run the ship? Giedi Prime is still a long journey from here.\"\n\n> *Regrets, there are many, and I have my share.*\n\n--- SERENA BUTLER,\n\nrunpublished memoirs\n\n> **T**he cloud-gray blockade runner was not only fast and difficult to\n> see against the murky skies of Giedi Prime, it contained the most\n> sophisticated stealth profile of any craft in the League arsenal.\n> Serena hoped Ort Wibsen's crack abilities would be enough to get her\n> team through to the isolated island in the northern sea, where they\n> could begin their work.\n>\n> Pinquer Jibb had provided the blueprints, plans, and access codes for\n> the secondary shield-transmitting towers, if any of the systems\n> remained intact. But even with the excellent military advisors and\n> engineers, no part of this was going to be obvious or easy.\n>\n> After the long journey from Salusa, they now flew silently through the\n> darkened sky, studying the land mass below. Unnecessary parts of the\n> power grid had been shut down, cities plunged into barbarous\n> blackness. Machines, after all, could simply adjust their optic\n> sensors to see in the dark.\n>\n> Serena didn't know how many trained Home Guard members had survived.\n> She hoped some had gone underground after the thinking-machine\n> takeover, as the desperate courier Jibb had promised. Once her\n> commandos restored the scrambler shields, the Home Guard survivors\n> would be crucial in retaking the planet.

By now, back on Salusa, her father would know she had gone, and\n> she hoped Xavier would already have launched his strike force for\n> Giedi Prime. If he didn't come, then their mission was doomed, and so\n> were she and her team.\n>\n> Xavier would be upset and worried about her, angry at the foolish risk\n> she had taken. But if she achieved results, all the effort would be\n> justified.\n>\n> Nothing remained but the task itself.\n>\n> Hunched forward in the cockpit, old Wibsen scanned the northern\n> regions to pinpoint the uncompleted transmitter station. Serena had\n> gleaned only a general location from Xavier's report, but she knew the\n> conquering machines wouldn't have bothered with an isolated arctic\n> island while subjugating Giedi Prime's population. So long as they\n> didn't call attention to themselves, perhaps Brigit Paterson's\n> engineers could complete their work without interference.\n>\n> The hardened veteran studied an instrument console, scratching his\n> rough cheek. After his forced retirement, Wibsen had never maintained\n> a crisp, spit-and-polish military appearance; now, at the conclusion\n> of their journey across space, he looked more rumpled than ever. But\n> Serena had not enlisted him for his wardrobe or his personal hygiene\n> habits.\n>\n> He watched streaks of light and blips on a scanner screen. \"There it\n> is. Must be the right island.\" With a satisfied grunt, he began\n> touching buttonpads like a musician playing a keyboard to reveal a\n> weaving but safe course through the machines'electronic sensor net.\n> \"The stealth film on our hull should let us slip right through their\n> surveillance. Sixty, seventy percent chance, I'd say.\"\n>\n> Serena accepted the grim reality. \"That's better odds than the people\n> of Giedi Prime have.\"\n>\n> \"At the moment,\" Wibsen said.\n>\n> Brigit Paterson stepped into the cockpit, not losing her balance as\n> the deck shook in buffeting winds. \"Most of the Armada wouldn't even\n> take the chance. They'd probably write off Giedi Prime until they had\n> a perfect, risk-free opportunity.\"\n>\n> \"We'll just have to show them how it's done,\" Wibsen said. Serena\n> wished Xavier could be here so they could make decisions together.\n>\n> The camouflaged blockade runner sliced through the murky atmosphere at\n> an efficient angle and approached the cold, leaden sea. \"Time to duck\n> out of sight,\" the veteran said. \"Hang on.\"\n>\n> The smooth ship plunged beneath the deep water like a hot iron. The\n> gush of steam was followed by hardly a ripple. Then, concealed by the\n> ocean, the craft glided north toward the coordinates of the rocky\n> island where a nervous Magnus Sumi had built his backup shield\n> transmitters.\n>\n> \"I'd say we're sufficiently out of sensor range,\" Serena said. \"We can\n> breathe easy for a while.\"\n>\n> Wibsen cocked an eyebrow. \"I hadn't even started to sweat yet.\"\n>\n> As if to disprove his remark, he fought to control a sudden coughing\n> spasm while he maneuvered the converted blockade runner through the\n> dim underwater currents. The old man cursed his health, cursed the\n> implanted medical injector in his chest.\n>\n> \"Commander, don't jeopardize this mission because of your stubborn\n> pride,\" Serena scolded.\n>\n> The ship pitched to one side and creaked. Behind a bulkhead something\n> fizzed. \"Damn water turbulence!\" Red-faced, Wibsen kept the blockade\n> runner under control, then turned back to glare at Serena. \"Right now\n> I'm just the chauffeur. I can relax as soon as I drop you off.\"\n>\n> The vessel cruised beneath the surface for an hour, deep enough to\n> avoid any floating chunks of ice from the polar regions, and finally\n> guided them toward a sheltered bay. On the cockpit screens, the\n> approaching island looked stark and rocky, all black cliffs and ice.\n> \"Doesn't look like much of a resort to me,\" Wibsen said.\n>\n> Brigit Paterson said, \"Magnus Sumi didn't choose the site for its\n> beauty. From here, a polar projection is simple and efficient.\n> Coverage from these transmitters is good for all the inhabited land\n> masses.\"\n>\n> Wibsen brought the blockade runner to the surface. \"I still think it's\n> an ugly place.\" As he guided them into the deep harbor embraced by a\n> crescent of cliffs, he began to cough again, louder and worse than\n> before. \"Damned ridiculous timing.\" He looked more annoyed than\n> distressed. \"We're on auto-guide, still on course. Get Jibb over here\n> to fly for a while. This is his home territory after all.\"\n>\n> Curly-haired Pinquer Jibb looked at the approaching island complex,\n> seemingly disappointed that the Home Guard refugees hadn't already\n> completed the work. He took the controls from the veteran and brought\n> the blockade runner to the island's abandoned quays and loading docks.\n> After they had clamped into place, he opened the hatches.\n>\n> Purplish dawn spread like a bruise across the northern sky. Breathing\n> the fresh but biting air, Serena stood in warm clothes with her team\n> members. The rocky island looked forbidding and seemed completely\n> deserted.\n>\n> More heartwarming, though, was the set of silvery towers with\n> parabolic sides and metal-lattice grids. Ice and frost rimed the\n> structures, but they appeared untouched by the thinking-machine\n> invaders.\n>\n> \"Once we switch those on, the robots won't know what hit'em,\" Wibsen\n> said, hauling himself out into the open, looking somewhat recovered.\n> He blew a lungful of white steam onto his hands.\n>\n> Serena kept looking at the towers, a sweeping expression of hope and\n> determination on her face. Brigit Paterson nodded, all business. \"Even\n> so, we've got our work cut out for us.\"\n>\n> *In times of war, every person claims to contribute to the effort.\n> Some give lip service, some provide funds, but few are willing to\n> sacrifice everything.

They were not the *only*\n> weapon against the terrible cymeks, not the most powerful blow the\n> League could strike. But they were critical to the war effort.\n>\n> Zufa stood in the fleshy underbrush with her trainees and looked at\n> them with compassion and love. No one in all the League Worlds was\n> more confident of success or devoted to victory. Her heart seemed\n> ready to burst as she saw them focusing every scrap of energy toward\n> the ultimate goal. If only everyone else could be as intent, the\n> thinking machines would be defeated in short order.\n>\n> As she had done for months now, Zufa led her elite group into the\n> jungle where they could practice their skills and summon the power\n> within their spirits. Each of these women was the equivalent of a\n> psychic warhead. Zufa, blessed from birth with more talents than any\n> of them, had been sharing her methods, pushing the others to their\n> limits. She had patiently taught them how to unleash incredible\n> telepathic abilities . . .and how to exercise control. The women had\n> performed admirably, beyond Zufa's most optimistic forecasts.\n>\n> But they must make their effort stand for something.\n>\n> Now she sat on a fallen silvery-barked log that was overgrown with a\n> thick cushion of shelf fungus. The canopy was dense with shadows that\n> interlocked high overhead. Dark purple foliage filtered the caustic\n> rainwater\n>\n> so that droplets trickling like tears to the mulchy ground were fresh\n> and drinkable. Large insects and spiny rodents tore through the soil\n> layers, oblivious to the testing the Sorceresses were about to begin.\n>\n> \"Concentrate. Relax . . . but be prepared to *focus* with all your\n> might, when I command you to do so.\" Zufa looked at the women, all of\n> them tall and pale, with translucent skin and shining white hair. They\n> looked like guardian angels, luminous beings sent to protect humanity\n> against the thinking machines. Could there be any other reason why God\n> had granted them such mental powers?\n>\n> Her gaze moved from face to determined face: Silin, the bold,\n> impulsive one; creative Camio, who improvised forms of attack; Tirbes,\n> still discovering her potential; Rucia, who always chose integrity;\n> Heoma, with the most raw power . . . and nine others. If Zufa were to\n> ask for a volunteer, she knew all of her chosen Sorceresses would\n> demand the honor.\n>\n> It was her task to select who would be the first martyr among them.\n> Xavier Harkonnen was already anxious to depart for Giedi Prime.\n>\n> She loved her trainees as if they were her children . . . and in a\n> very real sense, they were, for they were following her methods,\n> maximizing their potential. These young women were so different from\n> her own Norma. . . .\n>\n> Facing the chief Sorceress, the fourteen stood together, apparently\n> content and calm, but coiled within. Their eyes fell half closed.\n> Their nostrils flared as they breathed, counting heartbeats and using\n> innate biofeedback skills to alter bodily functions.\n>\n> \"Begin to build the power in your mind. Feel it like the static\n> electricity before a lightning storm.\" She saw their expressions\n> flicker as their thoughts stirred.\n>\n> \"Now increase the power one bit at a time. Envision it in your brain,\n> but do not lose control. One step, then another. Feel the energy\n> amplifying--- but do not release it. You must maintain your hold.\"\n>\n> Around her in the dimness of the fungoid jungle, Zufa felt the energy\n> crackling, building. She smiled.\n>\n> Zufa sat back on her log, feeling weak but not daring to show it. Her\n> recent difficult miscarriage, expelling Aurelius Venport's monstrous\n> child, had left her drained. But there was so much work to do, so much\n> she could not delay or delegate. The League Worlds were depending upon\n> her, especially now.\n>\n> Everyone had high expectations of the most powerful Sorceress, but\n> Zufa Cenva placed an even greater burden upon herself. At every turn,\n> her plans and dreams had been hamstrung when people refused to expend\n> the effort or take the necessary risks. These eager, talented trainees\n> seemed different, though, and she assured herself that they would\n> perform up to her standards. Too often when she measured other people,\n> she found them wanting.\n>\n> \"Another notch,\" she said. \"Intensify your power. See how far it can\n> go, but always be careful. An error at this point would wipe us all\n> out--- and the human race cannot afford to lose us.\"\n>\n> Psychic energy pulsed higher. The Sorceresses'pale hair began to drift\n> upward as if gravity had failed. \"Good. Good. Keep it going.\" Their\n> success delighted her.\n>\n> Zufa had never been interested in self-aggrandizement. She was a stern\n> and difficult taskmistress, with little patience or sympathy for the\n> failings of others. The chief Sorceress did not need wealth and profit\n> like Aurelius Venport, or accolades like Tio Holtzman, or even a show\n> of attention like Norma seemed to desire by convincing the Savant to\n> take her as his apprentice. If Zufa Cenva was impatient, she had a\n> right to be. This was a time of great crisis.\n>\n> The underbrush stirred as native insects and rodents scampered away\n> from the pounding psychic waves that built to a crescendo. Trees\n> rustled, leaves and twigs fluttering as if trying to break away from\n> their parent stalks and flee the jungle. Zufa narrowed her eyes and\n> studied her students.\n>\n> Now they were reaching the most dangerous part. The mental energy had\n> increased until their bodies began to shimmer and glow. Zufa had to\n> use her own skills to erect a protective barrier against the combined\n> psychic pressure on her mind. One slip and all would be lost.\n>\n> But she knew these dedicated apprentices would never make such a\n> mistake. They understood the stakes and the consequences. Zufa's heart\n> ached as she gazed upon them.\n>\n> One trainee, Heoma, displayed more strength than her companions. She\n> had built her power to a higher level while still maintaining control.\n> The destructive force could easily have become a wildfire in her brain\n> cells, but Heoma held onto it, staring with unseeing eyes as her hair\n> whipped like a storm.\n>\n> Suddenly, out of dense branches high above, a thick-bodied slarpon\n> dropped, a scaly creature with needle teeth and thick body armor. It\n> tumbled among the young women with a crash, disturbed from its\n> predatory perch and maddened by the backwash of mental energy. All\n> muscle and cartilage, it thrashed, snapping with powerful jaws and\n> scrabbling with thick talons.\n>\n> Startled, Tirbes twitched--- and Zufa felt an uncontrolled surge of\n> power spouting like a released jet of fire. \"No!\" she cried and\n> reached out, summoning her own powers to blanket the student's slip.\n> \"Control!\"\n>\n> Heoma, with perfect calm, pointed toward the slarpon as if she were\n> erasing a smudge on a magnetic board. She drew a line of psychic\n> destruction across the scaly predator. The slarpon burst into\n> white-hot flames, thrashing as its bones turned to charcoal, its skin\n> crackling and tearing until it flaked off in puffs of ash. Flames\n> smoldered out of its now-empty eye sockets.\n>\n> Heoma's companions struggled to clamp down and exert their mental\n> forces. But they had been distracted at a critical moment and were\n> losing their slippery grips on their telepathic battering rams.\n> Steadfastly, Heoma and Zufa maintained a superhuman calmness in their\n> midst, a stark contrast to their frenzied efforts. The combined\n> psychic force rippled and undulated.\n>\n> \"Back down,\" Zufa said, her lips trembling. \"Ease the power away. Draw\n> it into yourself. You must retain it and reel it back into your minds.\n> It is a battery, and you must maintain its charge.\"\n>\n> She breathed deeply, saw that all of her psychic warriors were doing\n> the same. One by one they inhaled, and gradually the tingle in the air\n> dissipated as they began to dampen their constant efforts.\n>\n> \"Enough for now. This is the best you've ever done.\" Zufa opened her\n> eyes and saw her students all staring back at her, Tirbes pale and\n> frightened, the others amazed at how close they had come to\n> self-annihilation. Heoma, an island apart, looked entirely unrattled.\n>\n> In a broad circle around them, the soft fungal underbrush was curled\n> and singed.

Another instant, a hair's breadth less control, and\n> everyone would have been vaporized in a ball of telepathic flames.\n>\n> But they had survived. The test had succeeded.\n>\n> After the tension finally evaporated, Zufa allowed herself a smile. \"I\n> am proud of all of you,\" she said, and meant it. \"You . . . my weapons\n> . . . will be ready as soon as the Armada arrives.\"\n>\n> *Mathematical answers are not always expressed numerically.

She had so much to do, so much to learn. Best of all, the\n> Savant was eager to listen to her ideas. She couldn't have asked for\n> more.\n>\n> Quiet Poritrin seemed so different from the dense, dangerous jungles\n> and lava-rock canyons of Rossak. She was anxious to explore the\n> streets and canals of Starda, which she could see from her high\n> windows.\n>\n> Tentatively, she asked Holtzman for permission to go down to the\n> river, where she had seen many people performing some kind of work.\n> She felt guilty for even asking, rather than working tirelessly on a\n> means to fight the thinking machines. \"My mind is a little tired,\n> Savant, and I am curious.\"\n>\n> Instead of looking at her skeptically, the scientist wholeheartedly\n> endorsed the idea, as if pleased to have an excuse to accompany her.\n> \"I remind you that we are paid to *think*, Norma. We can do that\n> anywhere.\" He shoved aside a sheet of doodles and sketches. \"Perhaps a\n> bit of sightseeing will inspire you to a work of genius. One can never\n> know when inspiration might strike, or where.\"\n>\n> He led her down a steep stairway that clung to a cliff over the Isana.\n> As she stood beside the taller man, Norma inhaled deeply of the\n> river's smell, sour and peaty from silt and vegetation dragged down\n> from the highlands. For the first time in her life, she felt giddy\n> with her own possibilities; the Savant was genuinely interested in her\n> imagination, her mind, and he listened to her suggestions, unlike the\n> constant scorn she had received from her mother.\n>\n> Norma raised an idea that had occurred to her that morning. \"Savant\n> Holtzman, I have studied your scrambler shields. I believe I\n> understand how they function, and I've been wondering if it might be\n> possible to . . . extend them somehow.\"\n>\n> The scientist showed guarded interest, as if afraid she might\n> criticize his invention. \"Extend them? They already stretch across\n> planetary atmospheres.\"\n>\n> \"I mean a different application entirely. Your scramblers are purely a\n> defensive concept. What if we used the same principles in an\n> *offensive* weapon?\" She watched his expression, detected puzzlement\n> but a willingness to listen.\n>\n> \"A weapon? How do you propose to accomplish that?\"\n>\n> Norma answered in a rush. \"What if we could make a . . . projector?\n> Transmit the field into a thinking machine stronghold, disrupt their\n> gelcircuitry brains. Almost like the electromagnetic pulse from an\n> atomic air burst.\"\n>\n> Holtzman's face lit with comprehension. \"Ah, now I see! Its range\n> would be quite limited, and power requirements off the scale. But\n> perhaps . . . it just might work. Enough to knock out the thinking\n> machines within a substantial radius.\" He tapped his chin, excited by\n> the idea. \"A projector--- good, good!\"\n>\n> They walked along the bank until they reached the foul-smelling\n> expanse of mudflats dotted with sloppy pools. Crews of ragged,\n> half-clothed slaves sloshed out onto the mudflats, some barefoot, some\n> wearing boots that extended to their upper thighs. At regular\n> intervals across the featureless field, flat pallets on pontoons held\n> metal barrels. Laborers marched back and forth to the barrels, where\n> they scooped dripping handfuls of the contents and went to plunge\n> their fingers into lines marked in the soft mud.\n>\n> \"What are they doing?\" Norma asked. It looked as if they were\n> embroidering the mudflats with their work.\n>\n> Holtzman squinted as if he had never considered the details. \"Ah! They\n> are planting clam seedlings, tiny shellfish that we raise from eggs\n> filtered out of the river water. Every spring, slaves plant hundreds\n> of thousands of them, maybe millions. I'm not certain.\" He shrugged.\n> \"The waters will rise again, cover the clam plantings, and then\n> recede. Every autumn, harvesting crews dig up the shellfish: clams as\n> big as your hand.\" He held up his right palm. \"Delicious, especially\n> when fried with butter and mushrooms.\"\n>\n> She frowned to watch the backbreaking labor, the sheer number of\n> people wading in the mud. The concept of captive workers remained\n> strange and unpleasant to her, even Holtzman's teams of solvers.\n>\n> The scientist didn't venture too close to the smell and the slaves,\n> despite Norma's obvious curiosity. \"It's wise to maintain our\n> distance.\"\n>\n> \"Savant, doesn't it strike you as somewhat . . . hypocritical that we\n> fight to keep humans free from the domination of machines, while at\n> the same time some of our own League Worlds use slaves?\"\n>\n> He seemed perplexed. \"But how else would Poritrin get any work done,\n> since we have no sophisticated machines?\" When he finally noticed\n> Norma's troubled look, it took him a moment to realize what bothered\n> her. \"Ah, I've forgotten that Rossak keeps no slaves! Isn't that\n> correct?\"\n>\n> She didn't want to sound critical of her host's way of life. \"We have\n> no need, Savant. Rossak's population is small, with plenty of\n> volunteers to scavenge in the jungles.\"\n>\n> \"I see. Well, Poritrin's economy is based on having hands and muscles\n> for constant labor. Long ago, our leaders signed an edict banning\n> machinery that involves any form of computerization, perhaps a little\n> more extreme than on some other League Worlds. We had no choice but to\n> turn to human labor, a manual workforce.\" Smiling broadly, he gestured\n> toward the mudflat crews. \"It's really not so bad, Norma. We feed and\n> clothe them. Bear in mind, these workers were taken from primitive\n> worlds where they lived squalid lives, dying of diseases and\n> malnourishment. This is paradise for them.\"\n>\n> \"They're all from the Unallied Planets?\"\n>\n> \"Leftovers from colonies of religious fanatics that fled the Old\n> Empire. All Buddislamics. They've fallen to distressing levels of\n> barbarism, barely civilized, living like animals. At least most of our\n> slaves receive a rudimentary education, especially the ones who work\n> for me.\"\n>\n> Norma shaded her eyes from the reflected sunlight and stared\n> skeptically at the bent-backed forms out on the mudflats. Would the\n> slaves agree with the scientist's blithe assessment?\n>\n> Holtzman's face hardened. \"Besides, these cowards owe a debt to\n> humanity, for not fighting the thinking machines as we did. Is it too\n> much to ask their descendants to help feed the survivors and veterans\n> who kept--- and still keep--- the machines at bay? These people\n> forfeited their right to freedom long ago, when they deserted the rest\n> of the human race.\"\n>\n> He seemed offhanded about it and not quite angry, as if the problem\n> was beneath him. \"We have more important work to do, Norma. You and I\n> have a debt to pay as well, and the League of Nobles is counting on\n> us.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THAT EVENING, GRIPPING the cool metal of a wrought-alloy railing, the\n> small woman gazed out from her balcony window at twinkling city\n> lights. Boats and barges on the Isana looked like waterlogged\n> fire-flies. In the gathering darkness, flaming rafts drifted out from\n> the slave sector, mobile bonfires that floated into the marshes. Each\n> fire rose and peaked, then diminished as the burning rafts sputtered\n> and sank.\n>\n> Humming to himself, Holtzman came to offer her a cup of seasoned tea,\n> and Norma asked him about the boats. Squinting out at the drifting\n> bonfires, he was slow to realize what the slaves were doing. \"Ah, must\n> be cremation rafts. The Isana takes the bodies away from the city, and\n> the ashes are carried out to sea. Basically efficient.\"\n>\n> \"But why are there so many of them?\" Norma pointed at the dozens of\n> flickering lights. \"Do slaves die that often, each day?\"\n>\n> Holtzman frowned. \"I heard something about a plague traveling through\n> the worker population. Most unfortunate, requiring a lot of effort to\n> replace them.\" He reassured her quickly, his eyes brightening.\n> \"Nothing you need worry about, though. Truly. We have plenty of good\n> medicines shipped here, enough to tend all the free citizens in Starda\n> if we should happen to fall ill, too.\"\n>\n> \"But what about all the slaves who are dying?\"\n>\n> His reply was not on point. \"Lord Bludd has requested replacements for\n> them. There's a standing order for healthy candidates these days. The\n> Tlulaxa flesh merchants are happy to harvest more men and women from\n> the outlying worlds. Life on Poritrin goes on.\" He reached down to pat\n> Norma's shoulder as if she were a child needing reassurance.\n>\n> From the balcony, she tried to count the floating fires, but soon gave\n> up the effort. Her tea tasted cold and bitter.\n>\n> Behind her, Holtzman continued happily, \"I very much like your idea of\n> using my scrambler-shield concept as a weapon. I am already thinking\n> of how to design a field-portable projector that could be deployed on\n> the ground.\"\n>\n> \"I understand,\" she said, her voice hesitant. \"I will work harder to\n> suggest new ideas.\"\n>\n> Even after he left, Norma could not tear her eyes from the funeral\n> barges blazing across the river, the floating cremation fires. She had\n> seen how the slaves labored in the mudflats planting clam seedlings\n> and in laboratory rooms calculating hundreds of equations. Now they\n> were dying in droves from a deadly fever . . . but were easily\n> replaced.\n>\n> The League of Nobles desperately sought to keep from being enslaved by\n> the thinking machines. Norma wondered about the hypocrisy here.\n\n*All men are* not*created equal, and that is the root of social unrest.*\n\n--- TLALOC,\n\n*A Time for Titans*\n\n> **T**he Tlulaxa slaving crew came down to Harmonthep like a weary\n> convoy instead of a squadron of military raiders.\n>\n> Tuk Keedair rode in the lead ship, but he left the piloting and\n> shooting to the newcomer Ryx Hannem. Not yet jaded to the\n> slave-acquisition business, young Hannem would be eager to please\n> Keedair, and the veteran flesh merchant wanted to see what this novice\n> was made of.\n>\n> Keedair had a flattened nose that had been broken twice in his youth;\n> he liked the way it had healed, imparting rugged character to his\n> wolfish face. In his right ear he wore a triangular gold earring\n> etched with a hieroglyphic mark that he refused to translate for\n> anyone. A thick black braid, tarnished with strands of gray, hung\n> between his shoulders at the left side of his face\n>\n> --- a mark of pride, since commercial tradition required a flesh\n> merchant to slice off the braid after any unprofitable year. And\n> Keedair's had grown long.\n>\n> \"Do we have coordinates yet?\" Hannem asked, looking nervously at his\n> control panel, then out the cockpit wind-shield. \"Where should we\n> start, sir?\"\n>\n> \"Harmonthep's an Unallied Planet, boy, and the Buddislamics don't\n> publish maps. We just look for a village and then harvest the people.\n> Nobody's keeping a census.\"\n>\n> Hannem peered through the viewer, searching for villages. The\n> clustered Tlulaxa ships cruised over a waterlogged green continent. No\n> mountains or hills rose above the soggy landscape of lakes, marshes,\n> and waterways. Harmonthep seemed to have an aversion to pushing its\n> land masses much above sea level. Even the oceans were shallow.\n>\n> After a few more runs, Keedair might take a long furlough back on\n> Tlulax, the closed-off world of his people. It was a nice place to\n> relax, though he was sure he'd get restless again before long. As a\n> \"procurer of human resources,\" Keedair had no regular home.\n>\n> The Tlulaxa biological industry had a constant demand for fresh\n> material, generated from new subjects, untapped genetic lines. By\n> imposing a high degree of secrecy on their work, the Tlulaxa had\n> managed to fool their innocent League customers. When the price was\n> right and the need great, the nobles easily swallowed stories of\n> sophisticated bio-tanks that could grow viable replacement organs. The\n> dedicated researchers eventually hoped to modify their clone-growth\n> tanks to produce such products, but the necessary technology had not\n> yet been attained.\n>\n> It was so much easier to just grab swarms of forgotten humans who\n> lived on outlying worlds. The kidnappings would never be noticed, and\n> the captives would all be carefully catalogued according to their\n> genetics.\n>\n> For the time being, though, the sudden shortage of viable slaves on\n> Poritrin had changed Keedair's business focus. As long as the plague\n> continued, it would be more profitable just to provide living\n> captives, warm bodies that needed no further processing. . . .\n>\n> As the slavers approached the tangled swamps, Keedair tapped the\n> scanned topographic map on his console screen. \"Fly low over that\n> broad stream and follow it. In my experience, you're likely to find\n> villages at a confluence of waterways.\"\n>\n> As the craft swooped down, he spotted large dark shapes moving in the\n> waters, serpentine creatures curling through bamboolike reeds. Huge\n> orange flowers bloomed on the tops of the stalks, opening and closing\n> like fleshy mouths. Keedair was glad he didn't have to stay on this\n> ugly world for long.\n>\n> \"I see something, sir!\" Hannem overlaid a magnified display on the\n> windscreen, pointing out a cluster of huts standing on poles within\n> the marshes.\n>\n> \"Good enough, boy.\" Keedair contacted the slaver ships in their wake.\n> \"Just like plucking fruit from a nobleman's garden.\"\n>\n> The marsh village did not look substantial. The round huts were made\n> of reeds and mud, fused with some sort of plastic cement. A few\n> antennas, mirrors, and wind collectors hung between them, although the\n> Buddislamics used little sophisticated technology. He doubted the\n> harvest from this single village would fill the holds, but he was\n> always optimistic. Business had been good lately.\n>\n> Three attack ships flanked Keedair's lead craft, while the Tlulaxa\n> human-cargo vessels were in the rear. Ryx Hannem looked uneasy as the\n> slavers approached the village. \"Are you sure we have sufficient\n> weaponry, sir? I've never been on a raid like this before.\"\n>\n> Keedair raised an eyebrow. \"These are Zensunnis, boy, pacifists to the\n> core. When the thinking machines came, these cowards didn't have the\n> balls to fight. I doubt we'll come out of it with so much as a bruise.\n> Trust me, you'll never see so much gnashing of teeth and wringing of\n> hands. They're pathetic.\"\n>\n> He opened the comchannel and spoke to his harvesting crew. \"Knock the\n> poles out from under three outlying huts and dump them into the water.\n> That'll bring people running out. Then we'll use stun-projectors.\" His\n> voice was calm, a bit bored. \"We'll have plenty of time to round up\n> the valuable ones. If there are any severe injuries, take them for the\n> organ stockpiles, but I'd prefer intact bodies.\"\n>\n> Hannem gazed at him worshipfully. Keedair spoke again into the\n> comchannel. \"There'll be profits enough for everyone, and a bonus for\n> each young male and fertile female you take without damage.\"\n>\n> The linked pilots raised a cheer, then the four raider ships swooped\n> toward the helpless swamp village. Young Hannem held back as the\n> more-experienced slavers flew in. With hot beams, they chopped through\n> the tall poles and let the rickety huts topple into the murky water.\n>\n> \"Well--- open fire, boy!\" Keedair said.\n>\n> Hannem discharged his weapons, disintegrating one of the thick support\n> legs and strafing open the side of a hut wall, setting the reeds on\n> fire.\n>\n> \"Not so much destruction,\" Keedair said, forcing a veneer of calm over\n> his impatience. \"You don't want to harm the villagers. We haven't even\n> had a chance to look them over yet.\"\n>\n> Just as he had predicted, the pathetic Zensunni came boiling out of\n> their huts. Some shimmied down ladders and poles to reach wobbly boats\n> tied up against their hovels.\n>\n> At the edge of the village, the two human-cargo ships landed in the\n> marsh water with hissing splashes, their friction-hot hulls creating\n> steam. Pontoons opened up to keep the ships afloat, and loading ramps\n> extended to solid-looking grassy hummocks.\n>\n> Keedair directed Hannem to land near the scurrying knots of people.\n> Some splashed into the waist-deep water, while women dragged children\n> into reed thickets and young men brandished spears that looked more\n> suitable for catching fish than for warfare.\n>\n> The first Tlulaxa raiders set down gently, extending flat-footed\n> landing struts that sank into the mud. By the time Keedair emerged\n> onto a mound of trampled grasses with his stun-projector in his hands,\n> his companions were already out and opening fire, selecting their\n> targets carefully.\n>\n> The healthy men were marked first, because they were worth the most on\n> the Poritrin market, and because they were the likeliest to cause\n> trouble, if given the chance.\n>\n> Keedair handed the stun weapon to a grinning but intimidated Ryx\n> Hannem. \"Better start shooting, boy, if you want to bag any of this\n> booty.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THE BOY ISHMAEL confidently guided his boat along the waterways,\n> threading his way through the maze of creeks and passages. The reeds\n> were much taller than his head, even when he stood up in the wobbly\n> little craft. The orange flowers at tops of the reeds opened and\n> closed with smacking sounds, feasting on gnats that drifted through\n> the air.\n>\n> Eight years old, Ishmael had been foraging by himself for a long time\n> now. His maternal grandfather, who had raised him after the death of\n> his parents, had taught him well. Ishmael knew how to unearth secret\n> stashes of qaraa eggs that even the giant eels couldn't find.\n>\n> He'd found a good patch of salad leaves and had caught two fish, one\n> of a species he'd never seen before. His basket clattered and jiggled\n> as the venomous creatures inside crawled up and down the walls,\n> thrusting spiny black legs through the tiny holes. He had captured\n> eighteen milkbugs today, too, each as large as his hand. The family\n> would eat well tonight!\n>\n> But as he approached the village, guiding his boat smoothly through\n> the brown water, Ishmael heard shouts and screams along with buzzing\n> sounds. Static discharges. Ishmael paddled quickly but cautiously. The\n> reeds were too tall for him to see anything.\n>\n> As he rounded an oxbow, he saw the slaver ships, one of the biggest\n> fears of his tribe and the reason they had built their village in such\n> an isolated place. Several huts had been toppled, while others were\n> afire. Impossible!\n>\n> The boy wanted to yell and charge in fighting, but better judgment\n> told him to flee. Ishmael watched Tlulaxa slavers pointing their\n> stun-projectors, dropping one villager after another. Some of the\n> people tried to hide inside dwellings, but raiders smashed their way\n> through.\n>\n> The Zensunni had no locks on their doors, no shielded places to hide.\n> As followers of Buddallah, they were a peaceful people. Never had\n> there been war among villages on Harmonthep; at least Ishmael had\n> never heard of such a thing.\n>\n> His heart pounded. Such a loud commotion would attract the giant eels,\n> though the predators were generally sluggish in the daytime. If these\n> raiders did not quickly retrieve stunned villagers who had fallen into\n> the water, the eels would have a feast. . . .\n>\n> Without making so much as a ripple on the water, Ishmael moved his\n> boat closer to one of the raider ships. He saw his cousin Taina\n> crumple from a stun-blast and then be grabbed by dirty-looking men who\n> loaded her motionless body onto a wide metal raft.\n>\n> Ishmael didn't know what to do. He heard a roaring sound in his\n> ears--- his own blood flowing, his gasping breath.\n>\n> Then his grandfather, Weyop, pushed forward to the center of the huts,\n> and faced the chaos. The old leader carried a thin bronze gong\n> dangling from a pole, symbol of his office as the village spokesman.\n> Ishmael's grandfather did not seem at all afraid, and the boy felt\n> instant relief. He had faith in the wise man, who always found a way\n> to resolve disputes. Weyop would save the villagers now.\n>\n> But deep in his heart, Ishmael felt a terrible dread, knowing that\n> this would not end so simply.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> RYX HANNEM PROVED to be a fairly good shot. After the novice had\n> stunned his first captive, he continued with enthusiasm. Keedair kept\n> a mental count, estimating the haul, though he would not have an\n> accurate tally until the unconscious bodies were placed inside stasis\n> coffins for transport.\n>\n> Keedair clenched his jaw as the Zensunnis wailed and pleaded---\n> probably in much the same manner as the population of Giedi Prime had\n> begged during the recent thinking-machine conquest. Keedair had\n> business associates in Giedi City, but he doubted he'd ever see them\n> alive again.\n>\n> No, he couldn't dredge up any sympathy for these Zensunni bastards.\n>\n> Hannem called attention to an old man who stepped forward. \"What does\n> he think he's doing, sir?\" The old man repeatedly banged a metallic\n> gong on a long staff. Hannem raised his stunner. \"Do we take him?\"\n>\n> Keedair shook his head. \"Too old. Don't even waste a stun-blast on\n> him.\"\n>\n> Two of the experienced slavers thought the same way. They broke the\n> tribal leader's staff and pushed him into the water, then laughed when\n> he shouted curses in a mixture of his native tongue and Galach, a\n> universal language among the human planets. The humiliated old man\n> swam to shore.\n>\n> The remaining villagers wailed and wept, but most of the healthy young\n> ones were already stunned and in the boats. Old women and dirty\n> children cried out, but attempted no resistance. Keedair looked\n> knowingly at Ryx Hannem.\n>\n> Suddenly a boy sprang out of the reeds behind them, jumping from a\n> narrow boat. He threw sticks at Hannem and Keedair, yelling something\n> about his grandfather. Keedair ducked. A rock narrowly missed him.\n>\n> Then the boy grabbed a basket out of his boat and hurled it at Hannem.\n> The flimsy wickerwork broke and spilled a swarm of huge spiny-legged\n> insects that tumbled over Hannem's chest and face, biting. The copilot\n> let out a thin shriek as he batted at the creatures, squashing them,\n> but they continued to scramble up his arms and clothes. Their smashed\n> bodies oozed a thick milky substance that looked like pus.\n>\n> Keedair grabbed Hannem's stun-projector and directed it at the scrappy\n> youth. As the boy fell, Keedair also sprayed his copilot with a\n> paralyzing blast. It wasn't the best way, but at least it\n> incapacitated the aggressive venomous insects, in addition to Hannem.\n> Once aboard the cargo ship, they would put the injured slaver into a\n> stasis coffin, along with the new captives. Keedair didn't know if the\n> lad would die, or just have nightmares for the rest of his life.\n>\n> He shouted for the rest of the Tlulaxa to gather up the unconscious\n> people. It looked as if they might need the second cargo ship after\n> all. *Not a bad*\n>\n> *day*, he thought. He studied the motionless form of the native boy;\n> the scrappy Zensunni youth was certainly impetuous and foolish. This\n> one would be a handful for whichever human master purchased him.\n>\n> But that wasn't Keedair's concern. Let Poritrin deal with the problem.\n> Even stunned and dirty, the wiry boy looked healthy enough, though\n> maybe a little young to take with the other slaves. Out of annoyance,\n> Keedair decided to include the youth anyway. This one had caused him\n> trouble and might need punishment, especially if Hannem ended up\n> dying.\n>\n> The old village elder stood on the shore, soaking wet, shouting\n> Buddislamic sutras at the raiders, telling them the errors of their\n> ways. Bodies floated in the water, facedown. Some of the desperate\n> villagers used poles to nudge the bodies back toward shore, sniveling\n> and wailing the whole time.\n>\n> Keedair saw large black serpentine forms swimming along the narrow\n> canals, attracted by the noise. One of them raised its head out of the\n> water and snapped a fang-filled mouth. The sight of the ferocious\n> animal sent a shudder down Keedair's back. Who knew what other\n> creatures lived around here?\n>\n> Anxious to be away from the stinking swamps, he urged his crew to\n> hurry. He watched as the new slaves were loaded onto the ships. He\n> would be glad to get back aboard his own clean vessel. Nevertheless,\n> the profits from this operation would be well worth the inconvenience\n> and discomfort.\n>\n> When all was ready, he climbed back into his own ship, started the\n> engines and retracted the mud-encrusted stabilizers. As he lifted off\n> into the hazy sky, Tuk Keedair looked down into the marsh and watched\n> the giant eels begin to feed on a few stray bodies.\n>\n> *Mind rules the universe.

Strong and dedicated, the\n> Sorceress Heoma appeared more than ready to answer the call.\n>\n> From her cliff city on Rossak, Zufa coordinated the operation with the\n> League Armada. The chief Sorceress bit her lower lip and blinked\n> stinging tears of pride from her eyes.\n>\n> Serena Butler's unexpected and ill-advised mission provided the\n> necessary impetus to galvanize the Armada into an offensive. Amidst\n> the arguing and saber-rattling, Xavier Harkonnen had put forth a\n> well-integrated operational plan for the attack. Then he had convinced\n> his commanding officer to let him spearhead the strike. Now, high over\n> Rossak, the battle group of ballista battleships and javelin\n> destroyers was ready to depart from the orbital stations.\n>\n> The initial retaliation against the machine invaders must be a\n> dramatic and complete victory, much more than a localized fight. Each\n> planet affected the others, like the links of a chain. Tercero\n> Harkonnen would lead an Armada battle group, carrying Tio Holtzman's\n> brand new field-portable scramblers to knock out key robotic\n> installations.\n>\n> A Sorceress, though, must deal with the cymeks, whose human brains\n> would be unaffected by the scrambler pulse. Eager for the opportunity,\n> Heoma had accepted her role without hesitation.\n>\n> She was a lean young woman, twenty-three years old, with ivory-white\n> hair, almond eyes, and a plain-featured face that belied the strength\n> and turmoil within her powerful mind. But Zufa knew more than just\n> this woman's\n>\n> mental skills; she knew Heoma as a dear person, a daughter like she\n> wished she'd had herself. Heoma was the eldest of five sisters; three\n> of the others had already been indoctrinated as Sorceress trainees.\n>\n> Zufa stood before her top prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and placed her hands on Heoma's bony\n> shoulders. \"You understand how much rides on this. I know you will not\n> disappoint me, or humanity.\"\n>\n> \"I will achieve everything you expect of me,\" Heoma promised. \"Perhaps\n> even more.\"\n>\n> Zufa's heart swelled. As the straight-backed Heoma boarded the\n> shuttle, the chief Sorceress called after her, \"You won't be alone. We\n> all ride on your wings.\"\n>\n> During the final preparations, with stern words and a hard expression,\n> Zufa had spoken to the strongest Rossak men, chastising them for their\n> inability to play a useful part in the crucial fight. Simply because\n> they were impotent telepathically did not preclude their participation\n> in other ways. The assault on Giedi Prime needed their help as well.\n> With her flinty gaze, the statuesque Sorceress had shamed six of them\n> into accompanying Heoma as bodyguards.\n>\n> The Rossak men brought their personal supplies of stimulants and\n> mind-numbing painkillers, provided by Aurelius Venport. They had\n> undergone rigorous weapons training and learned powerful hand-to-hand\n> combat techniques.

We'll have let him down, along with the\n> people of Giedi Prime.\"\n>\n> Brigit summoned her engineers for an emergency meeting. \"We brought\n> enough stimulants along. We can work round the clock, provided we rig\n> area lighting to illuminate the platforms.\"\n>\n> \"Do it,\" Serena said, \"and press us into service if there's anything\n> we can do.

While the task was ninety-percent complete--- at\n> least, according to the plan on paper--- Brigit Paterson said the\n> remaining steps were the most time-consuming ones.\n>\n> \"We have to go component by component and harden the circuits. By\n> their very nature, these transmitting towers generate a field that\n> obliterates complex gelcircuitry.

It's a\n> touchy process.\"\n>\n> \"How much time?\" Ort Wibsen asked, chewing on his own impatience.\n>\n> \"A week, if we're lucky.\" Brigit frowned. \"Ten days if anything goes\n> wrong and we need to fix pieces.\"\n>\n> \"Eight days is the absolute soonest the Armada could arrive,\" Serena\n> said. \"That assumes Xavier organized the attack force and launched\n> within two days of receiving my message.\"\n>\n> Wibsen grumbled, \"That'll never happen with the League.

It's a\n> *remote* chance that I'll need any help.\"\n>\n> \"If you say so,\" Serena answered, covering a knowing smile. \"Brigit,\n> you'll be able to detect the Armada when they come into the system?\"\n>\n> \"We're monitoring the thinking-machine communications net. I'm\n> assuming once the Armada battleships approach, the robots will be all\n> atwitter with excitement.\" Brigit looked to her team and then gave a\n> grim smile. \"Yeah, we'll know.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> MOVING UNDERWATER AGAIN, the blockade runner cruised through the cold\n> depths away from the ice-choked northern sea. Looking over his\n> shoulder in the cockpit, Wibsen said philosophically, \"When we started\n> this mission, I thought you were crazy, Serena Butler.\"\n>\n> \"Crazy to try and help these people?\" She raised her eyebrows.\n>\n> \"No--- I thought you were crazy to give me another chance.\"\n>\n> According to his original mapping while guiding the ship through the\n> atmosphere, Ort Wibsen had identified weak spots in the robotic sensor\n> net girdling the planet.

The old veteran didn't\n> answer, but raced across the deck and dove inside the single lifepod.\n>\n> \"What's he doing?\" Jibb said.\n>\n> \"No time to court-martial him now.\" Serena couldn't believe the\n> veteran would just leave them to the thinking machines.\n>\n> Wibsen sealed the hatch of the lifepod and green lights shone around\n> the rim, indicating he was preparing for launch.\n>\n> Serena shot another blast from the starboard weapons, the only ones\n> aimed toward the oncoming thinking machines. She crippled another\n> vessel, but in a united effort, the cymeks and robots fired at the\n> blockade runner, ripping open the weapons ports. Serena looked with\n> dismay at her control systems. They flickered, sparked, went dead.\n>\n> With a lurch and an explosive thump, Wibsen's lifepod shot out like a\n> cannonball. It roared away, a fast-moving, heavily armored projectile,\n> barely skimming over the surface. Over the SOS frequency, the old\n> veteran said, \"Don't be asleep at the switch, now. Be ready!\"\n>\n> Pinquer Jibb powered up their engines, preparing to fly. The ship\n> began to cut a line through the water.\n>\n> Wibsen did his best to aim the lifepod toward the robotic targets.\n> Designed simply to carry a survivor to safety from a catastrophic\n> explosion, the escape vessel had thick shielding and hull plating---\n> and when it hammered into the closest enemy, it annihilated the cymek\n> ship, blasting all the way through and slamming into a second.\n> Battered and smoking amid the sinking wreckage, the lifepod came to a\n> halt.\n>\n> Serena shouted to Jibb. \"Go! Take off!\"\n>\n> He increased thrust, and the blockade runner lifted off from the\n> water, heaving itself into the sky. As they climbed, Serena looked at\n> the imager that showed the water below.\n>\n> In the wreckage of the two thinking-machine aerofoils, she saw the\n> lifepod hatch open. Wibsen emerged, battered but still defiant. Around\n> him, smoke and steam roiled into the air, and three angry cymeks\n> churned toward him.\n>\n> The old veteran reached into his pocket and hurled a dull gray sphere\n> at the nearest cymek vessel. The explosion knocked the enemy back and\n> also sent Wibsen toppling into the lifepod's hatch. He waved a pulse\n> cartridge rifle unsteadily with one hand, shooting again and again,\n> but three armored cymeks pounced upon him from their own aerofoil\n> vessels. Serena watched in horror as their articulated mechanical\n> claws ripped the old veteran to pieces.\n>\n> \"Hold on!\" Pinquer Jibb shouted, too late. Serena saw robotic vessels\n> aiming their heavy weaponry along the trajectory of the fleeing\n> blockade runner.\n>\n> \"I can't---\"\n>\n> The impact smashed Serena against the far wall. Explosions ripped out\n> their ship's engines. The craft began to plunge, Jibb unable to\n> reverse their fall back toward the ocean. The blockade runner careened\n> into the waves like a huge out-of-control sled, spraying up a high\n> tail of white foam. Water began to gush through cracks in the hull.\n>\n> Serena ran to the weapons locker, grabbed a pulse cartridge rifle of\n> her own. Slinging the weapon over her shoulder, though she had never\n> fired one before, she made ready to defend herself. Pinquer Jibb\n> grabbed another weapon from the open armory closet.\n>\n> With clanging sounds like impacting torpedoes, cymeks slammed into the\n> crippled ship. Without even attempting to use the normal access\n> hatches,\n>\n> they cut their way through the hull, ripping into the central\n> compartment like birds trying to get at the tasty meat inside a\n> seashell.\n>\n> Jibb opened fire as the first silvery arms protruded through the split\n> wall. A pulse-bolt damaged the cymek's arm but also ricocheted around\n> the ship's interior, inadvertently blasting the breach even wider.\n>\n> Another cymek came in from the top hatch, prying open the armor and\n> dropping its limber body into the chamber. Serena launched a\n> pulse-bolt, scorching its core. With a lucky second shot, she fried\n> the brain canister. A larger cymek worked its way in from above,\n> grabbing the fallen mechanical body and using it as a shield as she\n> poured more pulse projectiles into it.\n>\n> Next to Pinquer Jibb, a cymek shaped like a black beetle continued to\n> work its way through the hole torn in the hull. The copilot turned and\n> attempted to fire again, but the cymek thrust a long pointed arm\n> forward. Jibb dropped his gun as the robotic arm plunged through his\n> chest like a spear. Blood blossomed from the center of his uniform.\n>\n> The morphing end of the sharp leg shaft suddenly sprouted clawlike\n> fingers, and as the cymek yanked his hand back out of his victim's\n> chest, he tore out the dripping heart and held it up like a trophy.\n>\n> Above, the largest cymek threw the nonfunctional body of his dead\n> mechanical companion at Serena. The heavy hulk crashed down, cutting\n> and bruising her. Trapped, she couldn't move, pinned to the deck.\n>\n> The beetle cymek, blood still dripping from its spearlike limb,\n> wrenched its way through the gaping hull and clattered forward,\n> leaving Jibb's body behind. It raised two more pointed forearms above\n> Serena, but the largest cymek bellowed for him to stop.\n>\n> \"Don't kill them both or we'll have nothing to give Erasmus. He asked\n> for one of the feisty resistance fighters from Giedi Prime. This one\n> will do nicely.\"\n>\n> Hearing his words, Serena was terrified. Something ominous in the tone\n> made her think she would be better off if she simply died here. Gashes\n> in her arm, her ribs, and her left leg were bleeding onto the deck.\n>\n> Jibb's killer snatched the pulse projectile rifle out of her hands,\n> while the larger cymek lifted away the fallen body. He stretched out a\n> grappling arm and snagged her with a flexible metal fist. The Titan\n> lifted her off the deck, then held her face close to his glittering\n> optic threads.\n>\n> \"Oh, so lovely. Even after a thousand years, I can still appreciate\n> beauty.

Robotic battle vessels powered up, preparing to\n> launch into orbit as a massive, synchronized force to strike against\n> the *hrethgir* invaders.\n>\n> Brigit Paterson listened to the plans and smiled.\n>\n> Her secondary engineer hurried up to her, looking out at the\n> wind-swept rocky island. \"Shouldn't we turn on the scrambler shields?\n> They're all ready. What are you waiting for?\"\n>\n> Brigit looked at him. \"I'm waiting for the cocky robots to fall into\n> my trap.\"\n>\n> On crude screens installed in the unfinished facility, she watched a\n> hundred capital warships lift off from landing fields that had been\n> conquered during the original takeover. The huge mechanized vessels\n> rose from the ground, carrying incredible firepower.\n>\n> \"Not so fast.\" Brigit finally activated the rejuvenated Holtzman\n> scrambler shields. Ice-rimed transmitting towers pumped energy into\n> the linked network of satellites far overhead, and the disruption\n> spread out like a spiderweb, invisible and utterly deadly to AI\n> gelcircuitry.\n>\n> The robotic fleet never knew what hit them.\n>\n> Rising upward, unable to believe that something so unexpected could\n> affect their battle plan, the thinking-machine vessels struck the\n> thin, shimmering veil that immediately obliterated their computer\n> brains, erasing systems and memory units. Battleship after battleship\n> became inoperative and tumbled like asteroids out of the sky. With all\n> systems dead, they crashed and exploded on the ground.\n>\n> Some hit uninhabited areas. Others, unfortunately, did not.\n>\n> Brigit Paterson didn't want to think about the collateral damage she\n> had just caused to the already devastated world. Seeing the success,\n> her engineers cheered. Now the remaining robot battleships in space\n> could never stand\n>\n> against the combined might of the unified Armada, nor could they come\n> down to the surface to cause havoc.\n>\n> \"We haven't won yet,\" Brigit said, \"but it may not be long before we\n> get off of this rock.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THE ARMADA BATTLE group approached Giedi Prime, all weapons ready\n> against the thinking-machine scourge. Xavier prayed that Serena had\n> succeeded in her wild plan, and that she was down there safe,\n> somewhere.\n>\n> He had insisted on commanding the risky strike himself--- not because\n> he wanted to claim the glory of a morale-boosting victory, but because\n> he desperately wanted to find Serena.\n>\n> Secure in his mechanized grip over the planet, Omnius had misjudged\n> human plans and capabilities. After calculating the odds and seeing\n> only a small chance of League success, the evermind had probably\n> dismissed the threat of human retaliation. No sensible enemy would\n> ever attack against such overwhelming odds.\n>\n> But Xavier Harkonnen had no compunction against taking on hopeless\n> missions. And in this instance, the Giedi Prime evermind did not\n> possess all the relevant information. This Omnius lacked vital data\n> about the Sorceresses of Rossak, about the new portable scramblers,\n> and--- he hoped --- about the now-operational secondary shield\n> transmitters.\n>\n> When the orbiting robotic warships detected the battle group's\n> approach, they gathered into standard formation to destroy the Armada\n> vessels. In his comline, Xavier heard a report from his adjutant,\n> Cuarto Powder. \"Sir, the thinking machines are coming. Their missile\n> ports are open.\"\n>\n> Xavier issued the first command. \"Dispatch the ground assault\n> divisions . . . launch armored troop transports.\" The swarms of ships\n> carried the Sorceress Heoma and her Rossak bodyguards, as well as the\n> soldiers who would use the portable scramblers against the robot\n> warriors in Giedi City.\n>\n> Cuarto Powder suddenly looked up from his station, verifying the scans\n> his tactical officers had just forwarded to him. \"Sir, it looks as if\n> scrambler shields have just come on over the whole planet!\"\n>\n> Xavier's heart swelled. \"Exactly as Serena promised.\" The soldiers\n> cheered, but he smiled for a different reason entirely. Now, he knew\n> she must be alive after all. Serena had accomplished the impossible,\n> as she often did.\n>\n> \"Robotic warships are falling out of the skies! They were trying to\n> launch and got caught in the scrambler backwash!\"\n>\n> \"Good, but ground-based thinking machines will try to zero in on those\n> secondary transmitting towers. We've got to finish this while the\n> robot fleet is trapped up here and the rest of the thinking machines\n> are stranded in the cities.\" Xavier would not let Serena's work be in\n> vain. \"Let's take back the planet.\"\n>\n> Dropping out of the lead ballista's launch hatches, eight escort\n> kindjals flanked Heoma's single transport, all of them fully armed and\n> ready to engage the enemy. The mission of the kindjals was to cause\n> confusion and chaos, to distract the unimaginative robotic defenders\n> so that the Sorceress volunteer could land safely and carry out her\n> essential work.\n>\n> Seeing the robotic battleships zeroing in, Xavier urged the troop\n> transports to hurry. Swarms of smaller Armada ships streaked into the\n> turbulent atmosphere and headed toward Giedi City.\n>\n> Closing his eyes, Xavier sent his hopes with them, then concentrated\n> on the machine threat approaching in orbit.\n>\n> *Some lives are taken, while others are freely given.*\n\n--- ZUFA CENVA,\n\nrepeated eulogy speech phrase\n\n> **S**urrounded by six silent Rossak men, Heoma piloted the troop\n> transport. All of her guards wore padded uniforms and helmets that\n> provided some protection against projectile fire. Eyeing the altimeter\n> as their ship descended, the men swallowed cocktails of Rossak drugs.\n> The intense stimulants blazed like lava through veins and muscle\n> fibers, deadening pain and fear.\n>\n> With her telepathic abilities, Heoma saw the drugged men becoming\n> thunderstorms in human form, ready to unleash lightning upon their\n> foes. Individually they met her gaze, exchanging unspoken knowledge,\n> fully aware that they were about to die.\n>\n> The transport bounced and shuddered as it tore through perilous shear\n> winds. Heoma was no expert pilot, but she had enough training to land\n> the ship. It would not require a delicate touchdown--- only one they\n> could walk away from.\n>\n> She had expected robotic defender ships to intercept them, but Heoma\n> watched thinking-machine flyers crash to the ground, dropping like\n> stones into buildings and parks. Other machine flyers that managed to\n> swoop low enough to avoid the worst effect of the scrambler shields\n> struggled to land with damaged systems.\n>\n> \"They're not in any shape to worry about us,\" a man transmitted from\n> one of the flanking kindjals.

Tercero Harkonnen had also dispatched a\n> full-scale\n>\n> ground assault force after Heoma and her small team had started on\n> their way. Each prong of the attack had its specific mission,\n> requiring pinpoint attention to detail.\n>\n> Heoma watched the ship's controls, counting down the seconds. Hers was\n> to be a desperate single thrust; she would have no other opportunity.\n> And she had to be finished before any League soldiers got into\n> position.\n>\n> As the low clouds tore away, she could see the city below, grid\n> streets and tall buildings built by proud humans who had envisioned a\n> prosperous future. Entire city blocks were blackened, especially the\n> habitation complexes, which were apparently worthless to the inhuman\n> conquerors.\n>\n> Recalling her briefing, during which she had memorized the only\n> available maps of Giedi City, the Sorceress volunteer located the\n> citadel that had once been the governor's residence. There, the cymeks\n> had installed a new Omnius evermind, according to the ragged\n> messenger, Pinquer Jibb. Magnus Sumi's mansion had become a\n> thinking-machine stronghold.\n>\n> *Cymeks there.*\n>\n> Her kindjal escorts spread clouds of masking smoke. Launched canisters\n> dispersed sparkling electromagnetic chaff, flecks of active metal that\n> disrupted the robots'sensor capabilities. Heoma's craft followed the\n> dispersing cloud down to the ground. She hoped to remain hidden as\n> they approached the undamaged robotic flyers.\n>\n> Aware that ships were approaching, thinking-machine fighters launched\n> blind salvos. Explosions rocked Heoma's craft, and she saw that the\n> landing gear had been damaged. She brought the heavy ship down anyway,\n> braking as sharply as she could. On impact, the vessel careened along\n> a wide flagstone street, scraping and skidding, spraying fire, sparks,\n> and shrapnel. They finally crashed to a halt against the side of a\n> gray stone building.\n>\n> At once, Heoma and her men were up, unfastening restraints, gathering\n> weapons. She opened the side hatch and ordered her pumped-up\n> bodyguards to clear the way. Dutifully, she transmitted an all-clear\n> signal to\n>\n> her escort kindjals. One pilot responded as he streaked upward, \"Melt\n> the bastards.\" The fighters zoomed into the sky toward the second wave\n> of troop transports dropping ground assault teams into the\n> robot-infested city.\n>\n> The next part of the mission was in her hands.\n>\n> Heoma stepped away from the smoking craft, then gestured for her\n> glassy-eyed defenders to hurry toward the governor's citadel. She\n> loped after them, the target clear in her mind.\n>\n> Behind her, the battered transport craft exploded in its programmed\n> self-destruct sequence. Heoma didn't flinch. She had never intended to\n> leave herself any option of retreat.\n>\n> The bodyguards carried projectile launchers and disrupter guns. Such\n> artillery would have been too bulky for a normal man to carry, but\n> with their chemically enhanced muscles the men had superhuman strength\n> . . . at least until the drugs burned their bodies from the inside\n> out.\n>\n> Standing three meters tall, powerful combat robots guarded the\n> approach to the Omnius citadel. Though alert, the thinking machines\n> were more concerned with the Armada ballistas and javelins and the\n> restored scrambler shields than with a few humans running through the\n> streets. What could a handful of trivial *hrethgir* accomplish against\n> the invincible thinking machines?\n>\n> When the robot sentinels moved to block their approach, Heoma's\n> bodyguards opened fire. Without a word, they launched projectiles,\n> blowing the steel robots to debris.\n>\n> Overhead, buzzing watcheyes skimmed building tops and swooped down as\n> the squad ran toward the arched entrance to the Magnus's mansion. The\n> watcheyes kept track of Heoma's movements, reporting everything to the\n> Giedi Prime-- Omnius. But the Sorceress did not slow. Her bodyguards\n> blasted any machine target, holding nothing in reserve.\n>\n> Behind them in the streets, the first Armada troop transports had\n> landed, teams scrambling out and opening fire with handheld weapons.\n> They established a guarded perimeter so that their technicians could\n> set up the first of Holtzman's two prototype field-portable\n> scramblers.\n>\n> The device looked crude and bulky, erected on a sturdy tripod. Cables\n> connected it to the power source of the large troop transport. A\n> single blast from the pulse projector would drain the spacecraft's\n> engine--- and would also disable all unshielded robots for half a\n> kilometer.\n>\n> \"Clear!\" the technician shouted. Many of the soldiers covered their\n> ears as if expecting a thunderous artillery burst.\n>\n> Heoma heard only a thin, high whine, then a faint popping in the\n> fabric of the air. Sparks and smoke showered out of Holtzman's\n> prototype, and all the glimmering lights on the transport vehicle went\n> dead.\n>\n> Then, with a clatter like a metal hailstorm, hundreds of dead\n> watcheyes tumbled out of the air, striking the paved streets.\n> Lumbering machine warriors ground to a halt. More robot-driven\n> aircraft wavered in the sky, out of control, and tumbled to the\n> ground.\n>\n> A ragged cheer went up from the Armada soldiers still emerging from\n> their transports, building in enthusiasm as they saw that they had\n> established a foothold, a zone where most of the enemy robots had been\n> eliminated.\n>\n> Heoma had to complete her mission before she endangered any of the\n> other brave human soldiers. \"Inside! Hurry.\"\n>\n> She and her bodyguards rushed into the corridors of the government\n> citadel. As Zufa Cenva had taught her, she concentrated on building up\n> her telepathic powers until her mind ached with a surging power.\n>\n> Deep in the citadel, Heoma's squad encountered two interlocked robots,\n> still functional but disoriented. Apparently the thick walls of the\n> building had protected them from the brunt of the scrambler pulse. The\n> robots stood in front of them, cannon-arms raised, but Heoma\n> discharged a blast of\n>\n> telekinesis that knocked them sideways, helpless against an offensive\n> they could not see or comprehend. Before the staggering robots could\n> regain their feet, Heoma's bodyguards destroyed them with heavy\n> projectile fire.\n>\n> *Almost there.*\n>\n> Running at full tilt, she led the way toward the nexus of the\n> thinking-machine citadel, triggering alarms all the way. Many robots\n> had fallen inactive in rooms or halls, but others converged upon her.\n> Armored doors slammed shut in the corridors, as if to seal off vital\n> chambers, but Heoma could see they were not important. She saw exactly\n> where to go.\n>\n> Soon the cymeks would arrive and surround her. Exactly according to\n> plan.\n>\n> The tingle of mental electricity mounted in her brain like a power\n> transformer. Her skull felt ready to burst, but she did not unleash\n> her energy yet. She must retain all of her strength for one final\n> moment.\n>\n> She heard their crablike warrior-forms skittering down the corridor,\n> ominous sounds of sophisticated machine bodies guided by the brains of\n> human traitors, different from the regimented lockstep of the robotic\n> guards.\n>\n> \"It is almost our time,\" she announced to the fiery-eyed Rossak men,\n> her voice filled with excitement and barely suppressed fear.\n>\n> Skidding to a halt, she arrived within the main chamber where the\n> shielded core of the Omnius manifestation dwelled. Inside the armored\n> room, numerous watcheyes glared at her through glowing optic threads.\n>\n> A voice boomed out from myriad sources. \"Human--- are you wearing a\n> bomb, a pitifully weak explosive that you think can harm me? Did you\n> bring one of your atomics, or is victory not worth such a price to\n> you?\"\n>\n> \"I am not so na\u00efve, Omnius.\" Heoma tossed her sweaty white hair over\n> her shoulder. \"One person cannot possibly harm the great computer\n> evermind. That requires a much more extensive military strike. I'm no\n> more than one woman.\"\n>\n> As the giant cymeks approached from adjoining corridors, Omnius\n> simulated a laugh. \"Humans rarely admit the folly of their own\n> actions.\"\n>\n> \"I admitted no such thing.\" Heoma's skin was glowing red now, heated\n> with unnatural energy. Static electricity made her pale hair wave like\n> angry serpents. \"You have merely misjudged my purpose.\"\n>\n> The doors opened and three monstrous cymeks glided in with graceful\n> metal footsteps, as if savoring the capture of these humans. Heoma's\n> bodyguards turned and opened fire, using the last of their ammunition\n> to cripple one of the neo-cymeks in a single concerted attack.\n>\n> The second neo-cymek raised his integral weapons and vaporized the\n> fearless Rossak men into clouds of bloody pulp. The damaged neo-cymek\n> lay on the floor, its arms and legs twitching like a poisoned insect\n> not yet ready to succumb to death. The larger Titan cymek strode\n> forward.\n>\n> Now Heoma stood alone against the machines. Without moving, she\n> focused her mental powers, building to the point where she could\n> barely maintain even a shred of control.\n>\n> \"I am Barbarossa,\" said the cymek. \"I have squashed so many *hrethgir*\n> that it would take a computer to count them all.\" He and his companion\n> cymek came closer. \"Rarely have I witnessed such arrogance.\"\n>\n> \"Arrogance? Or confidence?\" Heoma smiled. \"Removing a Titan from the\n> equation is a worthy exchange for my life.\"\n>\n> The Sorceress's mental energy could do no damage to the hardened\n> gelcircuits of Omnius itself. Human minds, however, were more\n> vulnerable to her telepathic onslaught. She felt the flames of\n> vengeful energy cresting within her mind--- and released them in a\n> white-hot firestorm.\n>\n> The shockwave of psychic annihilation boiled the brains of Barbarossa\n> and his companion, as well as all other cymeks and hapless biologicals\n> crowded inside the citadel complex. Omnius let out a wordless bellow\n> of static and\n>\n> outrage. Heoma saw only white as her mental energy vaporized the\n> organic brains of the cymek generals.\n>\n> Leaving the newly installed evermind vulnerable.\n>\n> Outside, League ground troops waited for the telepathic firestorm to\n> fade, then surged forward to attack the now-defenseless stronghold of\n> Omnius.\n>\n> The work of recapturing Giedi Prime had begun.\n>\n> *Nothing is permanent.*\n>\n> --- Cogitor saying\n>\n> **W**ithin an hour of the transmitting facility's activation, the\n> cymeks and surface-confined robots had pinpointed its location. While\n> the battle raged in Giedi City, even after Barbarossa had been\n> annihilated, a kill squadron of neo-cymeks and robots was dispatched\n> to the northern sea. They surrounded the rocky, ice-covered island to\n> penetrate the compound and destroy the parabolic transmitting towers.\n>\n> With few weapons, Brigit Paterson's remaining engineers could not\n> possibly defend against such an onslaught, but they had no intention\n> of surrendering, either. Inside the main control center, she scanned\n> the skies and sea. \"The longer we hold out here, the more lives we'll\n> save.\"\n>\n> Pasty-faced and drawn with terror, the desperate engineers armed\n> themselves with grenades, pulse-projectile rifles, and a portable\n> artillery launcher and went to guard the quays and aerial approaches\n> to the island.\n>\n> The machine kill squadron did not issue ultimatums; they began their\n> attack as soon as they were in range. Brigit's engineers were ready\n> and fired back immediately. They reloaded, making their dwindling\n> ammunition count.\n>\n> The cymeks and robots were more intent on obliterating the towers than\n> on killing the few defenders. Most of their attack was directed at the\n> frosty structures that pumped a lifeblood of scrambler energy into the\n> sky. When a cymek shot knocked one transmitter offline, the shields\n> began to fade, but Brigit finessed the controls. Her cold fingers\n> flew, rerouting to more stable sections of the tower, and soon she had\n> a functional shield in place again. She didn't know how long it would\n> last.\n>\n> Outside, she heard explosions and screams, making her wonder how many\n> of her engineers remained alive. Her screens flickered as the sensors\n> were damaged in the firestorm, and she saw more ships approaching,\n> probably machine reinforcements. A whole squadron.\n>\n> Then louder detonations rang out in the water, and the cymeks began to\n> scramble. Robot vessels exploded, targeted by oncoming kindjals flown\n> by human pilots. She heard a ragged cheer from a woefully small number\n> of voices. The League Armada had sent rescuers to defend the shield\n> facility.\n>\n> Weak with relief, Brigit slumped into her chair, glad that this risky\n> scheme had worked. When she got home, she promised she would buy\n> Serena Butler the finest, most expensive bottle of wine available in\n> the whole League of Nobles.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AFTER HEOMA'S MIND-STRIKE obliterated the cymek enforcers, Holtzman's\n> second portable scrambler knocked out the robots in another section of\n> the city. The Omnius core was damaged and vulnerable.\n>\n> Surviving robotic defenders mounted a strong resistance, willing to\n> sacrifice anything to keep humans from reclaiming the planet and\n> destroying the evermind. While Xavier Harkonnen fought against\n> thinking-machine spaceships in his giant ballistas, he dispatched four\n> javelin destroyers to help secure the surface. Squadron after squadron\n> of kindjals soared over targets, wrecking the embryonic machine\n> infrastructure, crippling any robots that had been beyond the range of\n> the field-portable scramblers.\n>\n> Armada troop transports dumped soldiers onto the battleground to seek\n> out and sabotage thinking-machine strongholds. Scanner ships sent\n> messages to rally any knots of human resistance, calling for others to\n> rise up and join the fighting.\n>\n> In response, distraught men, women, and children surged out of\n> buildings, breaking away from slave gangs. They ran through the\n> streets with any weapons they could find, some recovered from fallen\n> robots.\n>\n> As the tide of battle began to turn, Xavier issued a set of general\n> orders, delegating responsibilities and mop-up zones to the Armada\n>\n> subcommanders. Then he set out with elite search teams to find Serena\n> Butler.\n>\n> He flew directly to the island in the northern sea where commando\n> engineers had restored the shield-generating facility. He expected to\n> find Serena there, since this had been her scheme all along. Xavier\n> looked around, studying the bodies with dread, but saw no sign of\n> Serena or the old veteran Ort Wibsen. Nor did he see her blockade\n> runner.\n>\n> When he encountered Brigit Paterson standing outside in the cold\n> breeze without seeming to feel the chill, she was exuberant with their\n> victory. In a booming voice, she said, \"We did it, Tercero! I would\n> never have bet a single credit on our odds of success, but Serena knew\n> what she was doing. I can't believe she pulled us through.\"\n>\n> Xavier felt ready to melt with relief. \"Where is she?\"\n>\n> \"She's not with the Armada?\" Brigit frowned. \"She left here days ago\n> to intercept your ships and inform you of what we had accomplished.\"\n> She blinked, suddenly disturbed. \"We thought she'd given you all the\n> information.\"\n>\n> \"No, we came because of the message she left me on Salusa.\" Xavier's\n> heart leaped with sudden fear, and his voice dropped to a frigid\n> whisper. \"Something must have happened. God, I hope not.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> XAVIER TOOK A small contingent of kindjals with his best pilots.\n> Serena was lost somewhere on Giedi Prime.

But Serena and her remaining commandos had not\n>\n> responded to any Armada transmissions. So many things could have\n> happened.\n>\n> Bad things.\n>\n> The Armada had orders for the final phase of the operation on Giedi\n> Prime. Convoys were airlifting survivors away from the damaged\n> government complex in Giedi City. He hoped Serena was not in there.\n>\n> Ten kilometers above the surface, centered over the citadel that had\n> once been the home of Magnus Sumi, the squadron leveled out, and\n> Xavier knew it was time. Only a few months earlier, in those buildings\n> below, he and his inspection team had been hosted by the Magnus at a\n> banquet.\n>\n> Now Omnius must be excised like a cancer, obliterated from Giedi\n> Prime.\n>\n> Circling over the wounded metropolis, Xavier hesitated. His stomach\n> knotted, and he finally gave the order to his crew. The kindjals\n> disgorged their deadly loads.\n>\n> Xavier closed his eyes, then forced himself to watch the terrible\n> solution. This was the only way to be certain. Even if shreds of the\n> evermind had been distributed in substations around Giedi Prime, the\n> vigorous occupation force would root out any remnants. For now, the\n> humans must annihilate the computer core that cowered like an evil\n> insect queen in the citadel complex, cut off from all its\n> infrastructure, stripped of its machine protectors.\n>\n> Through the tattered smoke and cloud cover, Xavier watched a dozen\n> high-thermal bombs go off, blazing flashes and thunderclaps over the\n> center of Giedi City, vaporizing the government buildings. For blocks\n> around, even stone melted. Steel turned to ash. Glass vaporized.\n> Nothing could survive.\n>\n> A bittersweet victory . . . but victory nonetheless.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> DURING AN INSPECTION tour two days later, Tercero Harkonnen and his\n> line officers documented the decimation of Giedi City.

Ahead, wavering in the crosshairs, the\n> *Dream Voyager* surged forward, trying to evade Armada weapons fire\n> and to escape back into space.\n>\n> Abruptly, Xavier was startled to hear a human voice--- or one that\n> *sounded* human--- coming over the comline. \"Hey, break off your\n> attack! This is a League ship. My name is Vorian Atreides. We have\n> boarded a machine craft and taken control. Stop trying to shoot us\n> down!\"\n>\n> Xavier tried to determine from the tenor if it really was a human\n> voice, or only a clever machine copy. Thinking machines were not\n> devious . . . unless there was a preserved cymek brain aboard. Some of\n> the kindjals dropped back, uncertain.\n>\n> \"Stay on your guard,\" Xavier said to his squadron, \"but cease fire\n> until we figure this out---\"\n>\n> Before he could finish his order, the suspicious ship looped and began\n> firing its own weapons, minimal defensive volleys that nevertheless\n> took the Armada fighters by surprise. One kindjal veered away, its\n> engines damaged.\n>\n> Xavier's console screen showed the image of a human face with dark\n> hair and shining fanatical eyes. A sleek, mirror-faced robot stood\n> next to him, his flexible copperfilm body rippling as he operated the\n> controls of the ship.\n>\n> *A human and a robot, working side by side?* Xavier couldn't believe\n> it.\n>\n> \"Open fire!\" he shouted. \"Destroy that ship.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> \"IT IS NOT wise to provoke them too much, Vorian,\" Seurat said,\n> maddeningly calm. \"I would rather leave here posthaste.\"\n>\n> \"I just gained us a few precious seconds, didn't I? You wouldn't have\n> thought of using a bluff.\" Vor couldn't stop grinning. He had read\n> similar words in the memoirs of Agamemnon and was glad to echo them.\n>\n> As the Armada commander took evasive maneuvers and rallied his kindjal\n> pilots, he hurled insults back at Vor on the comline. \"You are a\n> disgrace to humanity, a traitor!\"\n>\n> Vor laughed, proud of his place here. He quoted what he'd been taught\n> all his life. \"I am the pinnacle of humanity--- a trustee of Omnius,\n> the son of General Agamemnon.\"\n>\n> \"I apologize for interrupting your grand speech, Vorian, but I am\n> detecting more *hrethgir* ships,\" the robot said. \"More than we can\n> evade. Therefore, I am breaking off engagement. Our responsibility is\n> to protect the updates aboard. We have to make our report.\"\n>\n> Vor said grimly, \"If the Giedi Prime-- Omnius is already destroyed, we\n> will never have an update of what it did during its months of\n> operation here. We'll never know what he accomplished.\"\n>\n> \"A grievous loss,\" Seurat said.\n>\n> The robot guided the *Dream Voyager* toward orbit, farther from the\n> deadly scrambler fields. The acceleration pressed Vorian back into his\n> padded seat until he nearly lost consciousness. A squadron of\n> human-operated ships closed in on their tail, and the update ship\n> shuddered as an energy pulse hit the aft section.\n>\n> Seurat dodged, and another volley of blows pounded the hull, damaging\n> the armor plates. This vessel was not made to endure such punishment.\n> Vor heard onboard systems hissing, automated routines making temporary\n> repairs to the damaged parts. Another blast hit, even worse than the\n> others.\n>\n> \"We are operating on reserves,\" Seurat announced. Vor scanned the\n> ship's diagnostics himself, assessing the damage. The air in the cabin\n> began to smell acrid and smoky.\n>\n> The *Dream Voyager* lurched. More kindjals surrounded them, targeting\n> their engines. An explosion jarred Vor to his bones.\n>\n> \"We cannot tolerate much more of this,\" Seurat said. \"Our engines are\n> functioning at only a third of normal capacity, and I am flying as\n> fast as I can.\"\n>\n> \"Head into that high cloud,\" Vor said, as an idea suddenly occurred to\n> him. \"The water vapor is thick enough to act as a projection surface.\"\n>\n> Listening to his enthusiastic copilot, Seurat steered into a giant,\n> towering cloud. The damaged engines strained. More blows came from the\n> pursuing kindjals.\n>\n> Vor worked furiously at the controls, using the ship's sophisticated\n> systems to project virtual copies in its wake, electronic images of\n> the *Dream*\n>\n> *Voyager*. He had hoped to use the scheme in a tactical game with\n> Seurat . . . but this was a different sort of game. If it didn't work,\n> the already-damaged update ship would never survive.\n>\n> Moments later a hundred illusory *Dream Voyagers* seemed to surge\n> through the cloud, solido images reflected on the water vapor.\n> Momentarily confused, the pursuing squadron chased decoys.\n>\n> And the real prey limped away, its pilots stealing up into orbit and\n> hoping to remain unnoticed until they could get out of range. . . .\n>\n> *Even the expected can be a terrible shock when we have been holding\n> on to threads of hope.*\n>\n> --- XAVIER HARKONNEN\n>\n> **W**hile the survivors of Giedi Prime counted their dead, documented\n> the damage, and made plans for the future, Xavier felt hope fading. It\n> seemed that no one on the whole world had seen Serena Butler since\n> she'd departed from the island compound in the northern sea.\n>\n> He took twice his normal shifts aboard scout kindjals, flying regular\n> patterns over the settled continents, where thinking machines had\n> caused the most destruction. If Serena was alive, Xavier knew she\n> would never be hiding. Rather, the determined young woman would be in\n> the midst of the hardest work, taking charge as always.\n>\n> Flying eastward on the next scheduled search pattern, he watched the\n> yellow sun set behind him, leaving splashes of gold and orange in its\n> wake. A powerful gust buffeted his craft, and he fought to control it.\n> Xavier rose to a less-turbulent altitude above the jet-stream, while\n> his squadron followed him.\n>\n> Someday, after he and Serena were married, he could tell this story to\n> their children. His chest tightened at the thought, but he continued\n> his search, not daring to consider what he would do if something had\n> happened to her.\n>\n> From this altitude, Xavier could make out the major geographical\n> outlines of continents and seas as they soaked up the approaching\n> night. Through a powerful scope, he saw the center of a city and made\n> out clusters of lights marking human encampments. During their brief\n> and brutal rule, the machine conquerors had slaughtered countless\n> people and sent millions fleeing into the countryside.\n>\n> Now survivors began to filter back to their homes. Construction crews\n> had moved into the industrial complexes, where they ripped out machine\n> modifications and reestablished the production capacities that were\n>\n> necessary to repair dwelling units and distribute food and supplies.\n> Back in Giedi City, Armada experts pored over the ruined Omnius\n> citadel, analyzing the debris from the high-thermal attack. Only\n> scraps of twisted, burned-out hardware and an electronic signaling\n> mechanism remained.\n>\n> But full recovery would take a great deal of time.\n>\n> Xavier hated machines more than anything, but he also believed in\n> honor among men. He could not understand the turncoat Vorian Atreides,\n> who willingly flew beside a robot captain in a thinking-machine spy\n> ship. Brainwashed, obviously, but something in the young man's\n> arrogant demeanor suggested deep convictions . . . a fanatical,\n> single-minded passion. Atreides had claimed to be the \"son\" of\n> Agamemnon, the worst of the cymek Titans.\n>\n> Below, one of the squadron ships veered toward the water in the vast,\n> open sea. \"Tercero Harkonnen, I'm detecting debris in the water below.\n> Metallic wreckage of some sort.\"\n>\n> With sudden dread, Xavier said, \"Check it out.\"\n>\n> Two kindjals swooped down to the open sea. One pilot transmitted, \"The\n> mass and configuration suggests that it's the remains of a League ship\n> with military-grade armor. Maybe a blockade runner.\"\n>\n> \"Did we lose any ships of that type in our engagement?\" \"No, sir.\"\n>\n> \"Retrieve the wreckage,\" Xavier commanded, surprised at how steady his\n> voice sounded. \"We'll run an analysis.\" He didn't want to say it, but\n> knew that Serena and her team had taken such a craft out onto the open\n> sea, when departing from the transmitter facility.\n>\n> He thought of the shimmering image of Serena projected from the black\n> diamond necklace that Octa had given him. The memory was so sharp that\n> the achingly beautiful woman seemed to be standing in front of him\n> again,\n>\n> proud and determined with her misguided idea of helping the people of\n> Giedi Prime.\n>\n> As the crews gathered the scattered debris, Xavier saw that the hull\n> had been painted an unobtrusive gray with a film of stealth coating,\n> now blistered and peeled.\n>\n> He felt numb. \"We have to make certain, one way or the other.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> LATER, WHEN THE debris had been delivered to a temporary military\n> encampment in Giedi City, Xavier Harkonnen ordered a full examination\n> on any traces found in the interior of the destroyed craft. Other\n> parts of the wreckage seemed to have come from robotic aerofoils, but\n> he didn't care about that. His mind and body were numb with dread; the\n> conclusions seemed inescapable.\n>\n> Inside a battered lifepod not far from the downed blockade runner, the\n> recovery team also found the mangled remains of an old man, identified\n> as Ort Wibsen. All doubt dissipated. This had been Serena's vessel.\n>\n> They found more blood inside the waterlogged ship. Obviously they had\n> put up an extraordinary fight at the end. Xavier ran full DNA scans,\n> hoping for any result other than the one he feared most.\n>\n> But the results proved that the other victims had been the Home Guard\n> messenger Pinquer Jibb . . . and Serena Butler herself.\n>\n> *Serena. My love . . .*\n>\n> Hanging his head, Xavier tried to hold on to the unraveling strands of\n> hope. Perhaps the machines had only taken Serena prisoner. But that\n> was a ridiculously unrealistic possibility . . . and given cymek and\n> robot brutality, would that be a fate he could wish for?\n>\n> No, he would have to return to Salusa Secundus and deliver the news to\n> a distraught Manion Butler.\n>\n> There could be no doubt about it: Serena must be dead.\n>\n> *Whether we are rich, poor, strong, weak, intelligent, or stupid, the\n> thinking machines treat us as nothing more than meat.

These captives had been freshly harvested from Giedi Prime and\n> brought to Earth by order of Omnius. The work boss groaned inwardly,\n> suspecting that the cymeks would want to build another enormous\n> monument to celebrate the Giedi Prime victory, too, and his crews\n> would have to build it. . . .\n>\n> Erasmus supposedly had his eye on one female in particular, personally\n> selected for him by the Titan Barbarossa. Iblis had read the\n> documentation, knew that the new batch of prisoners might be an unruly\n> lot, considering where they had been captured.\n>\n> As the disheveled and disoriented slaves were herded off the space\n> transport in dirty clothes, Iblis perused them with a trained eye,\n> considering how to segregate them to work assignments, a few artisans,\n> a few skilled workers, most of them mere slaves. He separated out a\n> muscular, mahogany-skinned man for assignment to the Ajax pedestal\n> project, smiling encouragement to him, then dispatched others to crews\n> that required more manpower.\n>\n> One of the last to emerge from the ship was a battered woman who,\n> despite the dark bruises on her face and arms and the weary shock in\n> her expression, carried herself with pride, showing internal strength\n> in every movement. This was the one for Erasmus. *Trouble*.\n>\n> Why would the robot be interested in her? He would probably just\n> vivisect her anyway. A waste. And a shame.\n>\n> Iblis called to her, but she ignored his gentle yet authoritative\n> tone. Finally, with some rough encouragement from the guard robots,\n> she stood in front of him. Though only of average height, the female\n> had striking lavender eyes, amber-brown hair, and a face that might be\n> pretty if cleansed of grime and anger.\n>\n> He smiled warmly, trying to reach out to her with a little charm. \"The\n> records say your name is Serena Linn\u00e9?\" He knew full well who she was.\n>\n> Iblis stared into her eyes and detected a spark of defiance there. She\n> held his gaze, as if she were his equal. \"Yes. My father was a minor\n> official in Giedi City, moderately well-off.\"\n>\n> \"Have you ever worked as a servant before?\" he inquired.\n>\n> \"I have always been a servant--- of the people.\"\n>\n> \"From now on, you serve Omnius.\" He softened his voice. \"I promise\n> you, it won't be so bad. Our workers are treated well here. Especially\n> intelligent ones like yourself. Perhaps you could even aspire to a\n> trusted, privileged position, if you have the intelligence and the\n> personality for it.\" Iblis smiled. \"However, wouldn't it be best if we\n> used your true name . . . Serena Butler?\"\n>\n> She glared at him. At least she didn't deny it. \"How did you know?\"\n>\n> \"After capturing you, Barbarossa inspected the wreckage of your\n> vessel. There were many clues aboard. You are fortunate the cymeks\n> never needed to interrogate you in further detail.\" He glanced at his\n> electronic notes. \"We know you are the daughter of Viceroy Manion\n> Butler. Were you trying to hide your identity out of fear that Omnius\n> might use you in some sort of blackmail scheme? I assure you, that\n> isn't the way the evermind thinks. Omnius would never have considered\n> such a thing.\"\n>\n> She raised her chin defiantly. \"My father would never surrender a\n> centimeter of territory, no matter what the machines do to me.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, yes, you're all very brave, I am sure.\" Iblis gave her a wry\n> smile, meant to be comforting. \"The rest is up to the robot Erasmus.\n> He has requested that you be assigned to his villa. He has taken a\n> particular interest in your circumstances. That's a good sign.\"\n>\n> \"He wishes to help me?\"\n>\n> \"I wouldn't go that far,\" he said with a hint of humor. \"I'm sure\n> Erasmus wants to *talk* with you. And talk and talk and talk. In the\n> end, it's quite likely he will drive you mad with his famous\n> curiosity.\"\n>\n> Iblis instructed other slaves to clean and properly reclothe this\n> female, and they followed the trustee's orders as if he were a machine\n> himself. Although her mannerisms exuded hostility and resentment,\n> Serena Butler did not waste effort on pointless resistance. She had a\n> brain, but her intelligence and spirit were bound to be crushed before\n> long.\n>\n> The routine medical check, however, revealed a surprise. She glared at\n> Iblis, trying to maintain her defensive wall of anger, but a glimmer\n> of curiosity flickered behind her odd lavender eyes. \"Are you aware\n> that you're pregnant? Or is that just an unfortunate accident?\" From\n> the way she reeled, he saw that her reaction was not feigned. \"Yes, by\n> now it appears about three months along. You must have suspected.\"\n>\n> \"That is none of your business.\" Her words were hard, as if she was\n> trying to maintain her hold on something stable. The news seemed to be\n> a greater blow to her than all the rough treatment she had endured\n> since capture.\n>\n> Iblis made a dismissive gesture. \"Every cell in your body is my\n> business--- at least until I deliver you to your new master.\n> Afterward, I will really begin to pity you.\"\n>\n> The independent robot would no doubt plan interesting experiments on\n> her and the fetus. . . .\n>\n> *The psychology of the human animal is malleable, with his personality\n> dependent upon the proximity of other members of the species and the\n> pressures exerted by them.*\n>\n> --- ERASMUS,\n\nlaboratory notes\n\n> **E**rasmus's villa stood as a towering edifice on a hilltop\n> overlooking the sea. On the inland side, the main building loomed high\n> in front of a lovely flagstone square beneath high turrets; toward the\n> coast, a cluster of bleak, crowded slave pens huddled on the opposite\n> side, where human captives lived like livestock.\n>\n> From the highest balconies, the robot found the dichotomy curious.\n>\n> Forming his metal polymer facefilm into a paternal mask, Erasmus\n> watched as two sentinel robots strode through a slave pen, hunting for\n> twin girls that he required for a new round of experiments. The\n> panicked humans scrambled away, but Erasmus didn't shift his pliable\n> face into a frown. His myriad optic threads scanned the lean and dirty\n> forms, assessing.\n>\n> He had seen the little girls a few days before, noting their short\n> black hair and brown eyes, but they seemed to be hiding somewhere.\n> Playing a game with him? The sentinels tore through a doorway into a\n> tunnel that led to another pen; finally, they transmitted back, \"We\n> have located the two subjects.\"\n>\n> *Good*, Erasmus thought, anticipating the intriguing work ahead. He\n> wanted to see if he could force one of the twin girls to kill the\n> other. It would be a landmark experiment, one that would reveal\n> important insights into moral boundaries and how siblings defined\n> them.\n>\n> He especially enjoyed working with identical twins. Over the years he\n> had processed dozens of pairs through his laboratory, compiling\n> detailed medical reports as well as intensive psychological studies.\n> He spent a great\n>\n> deal of effort on meticulous comparative autopsies, microanalyzing the\n> subtle differences in siblings who were genetic carbon-copies. The\n> slave masters working in the crowded pens had instructions to identify\n> and select any new sets among the captive populace on Earth.\n>\n> Finally, the squirming dark-haired twins stood in front of him, held\n> by the sentinel robots. He shifted his pliable facefilm into a calm\n> smile. One of the girls spat on the reflective surface. Erasmus\n> wondered why saliva carried such a negative connotation for humans? It\n> caused no damage and could be cleaned off easily. The forms of human\n> defiance never ceased to amaze him.\n>\n> Shortly before Erasmus had left his estate on Corrin, twenty-two\n> slaves had removed their protective eye films and intentionally stared\n> into the furious red-giant sun, blinding themselves. Disobedient,\n> resistant--- and stupid. What did the rebellious act accomplish, other\n> than rendering them useless for slave work?\n>\n> They had expected to be killed, and Erasmus would oblige them. But not\n> so that they could become martyrs. Instead, he had quietly separated\n> them from other workers to prevent the spread of their unruliness.\n> Blinded, they could not find or earn food. By now, he supposed they\n> must have starved in their self-inflicted darkness.\n>\n> Still, he had marveled at their spirit, their collective will to\n> challenge him. Even though humans were a troublesome breed, they were\n> constantly fascinating.\n>\n> A watcheye buzzed nearby, making strange, raw noises. Finally, Omnius\n> spoke through it. \"The recent loss of Giedi Prime is your fault,\n> Erasmus. I tolerate your endless experiments in the hope that you will\n> deconstruct and analyze human behavior. Why did you not predict the\n> suicidal raid that obliterated my cymeks? The data and experiences of\n> my Giedi Prime counterpart were never backed up. Barbarossa is equally\n> irreplaceable, since he created my original programming.\"\n>\n> The Earth-Omnius already knew about the recapture of Giedi Prime\n> because of an automated emergency buoy launched by the robot Seurat,\n> whose update ship had unexpectedly encountered the disaster in its\n> duties. The alarming message had reached Earth only that morning.\n>\n> \"I was not given data that the Sorceresses of Rossak had developed\n> this capability of telepathic destruction.\" The robot's face shimmered\n> back into its blank oval smoothness. \"Why not also ask your questions\n> of Vorian Atreides when he returns to Earth? The son of Agamemnon has\n> helped us to simulate unstable human behavior before.\"\n>\n> Omnius said, \"Even his input could not have prepared us for what\n> happened to Giedi Prime. Sentient biologicals are unpredictable and\n> reckless.\"\n>\n> As the sentinel robots dragged the squirming twins away, Erasmus\n> directed his attention to the watcheye. \"Then it is obvious I have\n> more work to do.\"\n>\n> \"No, Erasmus, it is obvious that your research is not yielding the\n> desired results. You should strive for perfection, rather than\n> investigating compounded errors. I recommend that you overwrite your\n> mind core with a subset of my program. Turn yourself into a perfect\n> machine. A copy of me.\"\n>\n> \"You would sacrifice our fascinating, open-ended debates?\" Erasmus\n> responded, fighting to conceal his inner alarm. \"You have always\n> expressed an interest in my peculiar manner of thinking. All the\n> everminds especially look forward to your record of my actions.\"\n>\n> The buzzing of the watcheye intensified, indicating that Omnius was\n> shifting his thought pathways. This was a worrisome, volatile\n> situation. Erasmus did not want to lose his carefully developed\n> independent identity.\n>\n> One of the twin girls tried to break away from the robotic guards and\n> run back toward the dubious safety of the pens. As Erasmus had\n> suggested beforehand, the guard lifted her sister by one arm, leaving\n> her to dangle screaming. The free twin hesitated, though she could\n> easily have reached the temporary shelter. Slowly, she came to a stop,\n> surrendering.\n>\n> *Fascinating*, Erasmus thought. And the sentinel robot did not even\n> have to inflict cellular damage on the other girl.\n>\n> Thinking quickly, the robot said, \"Perhaps if I diverted my attention\n> to matters of military significance, you would more easily see the\n> potential of my work. Let me understand the mentality of these wild\n> humans for you. What drives them to such self-sacrifice, as we\n> witnessed on Giedi Prime? If I can distill an explanation, your\n> Synchronized Worlds will no longer be vulnerable to unpredictable\n> attacks.\"\n>\n> The watcheye hovered as a million possibilities showered through the\n> abundant mind of Omnius. Presently, the computer made his decision.\n> \"You have my permission to proceed. But do not continue to test my\n> patience.\"\n>\n> *People require continuity.*\n\n--- BOVKO MANRESA,\n\nFirst Viceroy of the League of Nobles\n\n> **O**n Poritrin, the virulent fever raced through the mudflats and\n> docks where slaves made their dreary homes. Despite the best\n> quarantine and mitigation efforts, the disease killed a number of\n> officials and merchants, and even spread as far as the slaves in Tio\n> Holtzman's blufftop laboratories, where it caused quite a disruption\n> in the scientist's work.\n>\n> When Holtzman first noticed symptoms of the illness among his crowded\n> equation solvers, he immediately ordered removal of the sick ones to\n> isolation chambers and sealed off the remainder of the calculating\n> teams. The distracted Savant thought the slaves would rejoice at being\n> relieved of their mathematical chores; instead the solvers moaned and\n> prayed, asking why the hand of God would strike *them* rather than\n> their oppressors.\n>\n> Within two weeks, half of his household slaves had either died or been\n> quarantined. Such a shift in daily routines was not conducive to the\n> Savant's mental work.\n>\n> Several large-scale simulations had been under way, following the\n> gradual development of parameters established by the talented Norma\n> Cenva. Groaning at the inconvenience, Holtzman knew that stopping the\n> lengthy work in midstream would necessitate new teams to start over\n> again. To maintain his stature, he needed a major breakthrough soon.\n>\n> Lately his reputation had been supported more by Norma's work than his\n> own. Naturally, he had taken full credit for modifying the\n> scrambler-field generators into an offensive weapon. Lord Bludd had\n> delighted in presenting two prototypes to the Armada liberation force\n> for Giedi Prime. Indeed, the scrambler projectors had served the\n> rescuers well, but the prototypes had consumed enough energy to ground\n> two troop transports, and the devices themselves had broken down---\n> irreparably--- after only one\n>\n> use. In addition, the disruptive pulse had yielded uneven results,\n> since many robots had been shielded by walls or unaffected by the\n> dissipating field. Still, the idea showed promise, and the nobles\n> urged Holtzman to work on improvements, without ever knowing about\n> Norma's involvement.\n>\n> At least Holtzman's reputation was secure again. For a while.\n>\n> Norma was quiet but diligent. Rarely interested in diversions or\n> amusements, she worked hard and scrutinized her own ideas. Despite\n> Holtzman's wishes, she insisted on performing most calculations\n> personally rather than handing them off to solver teams. Norma was too\n> independent to understand the economics of delegating tasks. Her\n> dedication made her a rather dull person.\n>\n> After rescuing the young prodigy from her obscurity on Rossak, he had\n> hoped, unrealistically perhaps, that Norma might provide him with\n> sudden inspiration. During a recent cocktail party in Lord Bludd's\n> conical towers, the nobleman had made a joke about Holtzman taking a\n> holiday from his usual brilliance. Though the comment had stung, the\n> inventor had laughed along with the other tittering nobles. Still, it\n> high-lighted--- in his own mind, at least--- that he had not created\n> anything really original in some time.\n>\n> Following a restless night of bizarre dreams, Holtzman finally came up\n> with a concept to explore. Expanding some of the electromagnetic\n> features he had used for his scrambler fields, he might be able to\n> create an \"alloy resonance generator.\" Properly tuned, a thermal-field\n> inducer would couple with metals--- the bodies of robots, for\n> instance, or even the crablike warrior-forms worn by cymeks. Given the\n> correct adjustment, the resonance generator could slam selected metal\n> atoms against each other, generating enormous heat until the machine\n> shook itself apart.\n>\n> The concept seemed promising. Holtzman intended to pursue its\n> development with full enthusiasm and haste.\n>\n> But first he needed more solvers and assistants to construct the\n> prototype. And now he had to waste a day on the mundane task of\n> replacing the\n>\n> household slaves that had died from the fever. With a frustrated sigh,\n> he left his laboratories and trudged down the zigzag trail to the base\n> of the bluffs, where he caught a jetboat across the river.\n>\n> On the opposite shore, at the widest part of the delta, he visited a\n> bustling river market. Rafts and barges had been lashed together for\n> so long that they might well have been part of the landscape. The\n> merchants'quarter was not far from the Starda spaceport, where vendors\n> provided offworld oddities: drugs from Rossak, interesting woods and\n> plants from Ecaz, gems from Hagal, musical instruments from Chusuk.\n>\n> In shops that fronted a narrow alley, tailors were copying the latest\n> Salusan fashions, cutting and sewing exotic imported cloths and fine\n> Poritrin linens. Holtzman had used many of these garment makers to\n> enhance his personal wardrobe. An eminent Savant such as himself could\n> not spend all of his time in the laboratories. After all, he was\n> frequently called upon to make public appearances to answer questions\n> from citizens and often spoke before committees of nobles, to convince\n> them of his continued importance.\n>\n> But today Holtzman made his way farther out onto the floating rafts\n> and barges. He needed to purchase people, not clothes. The scientist\n> saw a sign on the dock ahead, in Galach:HUMAN RESOURCES. He crossed\n> creaking boardwalks and gangplanks to a cluster of rafts that held\n> captives. Grouped in lots behind barricades, the sullen prisoners were\n> dressed in drab, identical uniforms, many of which fit badly. The\n> slaves were lean and angular, as if unaccustomed to eating regular\n> meals. These men and women came from planets that few of the free\n> citizens of Poritrin had ever heard of, much less visited.\n>\n> Their handlers seemed aloof, not particularly eager to show off wares\n> or haggle over prices. After the recent plague, many households and\n> estates needed to replace their personnel, and it was a\n> sellers'market.\n>\n> Other customers crowded against the railings, scrutinizing the\n> downcast faces, inspecting the merchandise. One old man clutching a\n> wad of credits\n>\n> summoned the tender and asked for a closer look at four middle-aged\n> females.\n>\n> Holtzman was not particularly picky, nor did he want to waste time.\n>\n> Since he needed so many slaves, he intended to buy an entire lot. Once\n> they arrived at his blufftop estate, he would choose the most\n> intelligent ones to work calculations, while the remainder would cook,\n> clean, or maintain his household.\n>\n> He hated these menial shopping duties, but had never delegated them in\n> the past. He smiled, realizing he had been critical of Norma for doing\n> the very same thing, for her failure to use solvers.\n>\n> Impatient and eager, Holtzman summoned the nearest handler, waving\n> Niko Bludd's credit authorization and pushing himself to the front. \"I\n> want a large order of slaves.\"\n>\n> The Human Resources merchant bustled over, grinning and bowing. \"Of\n> course, Savant Holtzman! What you require, I shall provide. Simply\n> specify your needs, and I will provide a competitive quotation.\"\n>\n> Suspicious that the merchant might try to cheat him, he said, \"I need\n> slaves that are smart and independent, but capable of following\n> instructions. Seventy or eighty will do, I suppose.\" Some of the\n> customers pushing close to the railing grumbled, but did not challenge\n> the celebrity inventor.\n>\n> \"Quite a demand,\" the vendor said, \"especially in these lean times.\n> The plague has created a shortage, until the Tlulaxa flesh merchants\n> deliver more.\"\n>\n> \"Everyone knows how important--- and *essential*--- my work is,\"\n> Holtzman said, pointedly removing a chronometer from the wide sleeve\n> of his white robe. \"My needs take precedence over some rich citizen\n> looking to replace a house cleaner.

He shouted at\n> the other customers pushing forward. \"All of you, quit your\n> complaining! Without this man, we'd be sweeping the floors for\n> thinking machines right now!\" Putting on another face, the handler\n> smiled back at Holtzman. \"The question, of course, is which slaves\n> would best serve you? I have a new batch just delivered from\n> Harmonthep: Zensunnis, all of them. Suitably docile, but I'm afraid\n> they go for a premium.\"\n>\n> Holtzman frowned. He preferred to use his finances in other ways,\n> especially considering the large investment that would be necessary\n> for his new alloy-resonator concept. \"Do not attempt to take advantage\n> of me, sir.\"\n>\n> The man reddened, but held his ground, sensing that the inventor was\n> in a hurry. \"Perhaps another group would be more suitable then? I have\n> some just in from IV Anbus.\" He gestured to a separate raft where\n> dark-haired slaves stared out with hostile expressions, challenging\n> the customers. \"They are Zenshiites.\"\n>\n> \"What's the difference? Are they less expensive?\"\n>\n> \"A simple matter of religious philosophy.\" The slave merchant waited\n> for some recognition, didn't see it, then smiled with relief. \"Who can\n> understand the Buddislamics, anyway? They're workers, and that's what\n> you need, right? I can sell you these Zenshiites for a lower price,\n> even though they're quite intelligent. Probably better educated than\n> the Harmonthep lot. They're healthy, too. I have medical\n> certifications. Not one of them has been exposed to the plague virus.\"\n>\n> Holtzman perused the group. They all had rolled up their left sleeves,\n> as if it were some kind of badge. Up front, a muscular man with fiery\n> eyes and a thick black beard gazed back at him dispassionately, as if\n> he considered himself superior to those who held him captive.\n>\n> With his cursory inspection, Holtzman could see nothing wrong with the\n> IV Anbus captives. His household was desperately understaffed, and his\n> laboratories needed more low-level technicians. Every day it was a\n> struggle\n>\n> to find enough solvers to work through the increasingly complex sets\n> of equations.\n>\n> \"But why are they cheaper?\" he persisted.\n>\n> \"They are more plentiful. It's a simple matter of supply and demand.\"\n> The slave vendor held his gaze. He named a price.\n>\n> Too impatient to haggle for the best deal, Holtzman nodded. \"I'll take\n> eighty of them.\" He raised his voice. \"I don't care if they're from IV\n> Anbus or Harmonthep. They're on Poritrin now, and they work for Savant\n> Tio Holtzman.\"\n>\n> The crafty slave merchant turned to the group of captives and shouted.\n> \"You hear that? You should be proud.\"\n>\n> The dark-haired captives simply looked back at their new master,\n> saying nothing. Holtzman was relieved. That probably meant they would\n> be more tractable.\n>\n> He transferred the correct amount of credits. \"See that they are\n> cleaned up and sent to my residence.\"\n>\n> The grinning slave handler thanked him profusely. \"Don't you worry,\n> Savant Holtzman. You'll be satisfied with this lot.\"\n>\n> As the great man left the crowded river market, other customers began\n> to shout and wave their credit vouchers, squabbling over the remaining\n> slaves. It promised to be a furious day of bidding.\n\n*Over the course of history, the stronger species invariably wins.*\n\n--- TLALOC,\n\n*A Time for Titans*\n\n> **A**fter taking refuge in the Arrakis wasteland, the Zensunni\n> Wanderers were little more than scavengers, and not very brave. Even\n> on their most distant excursions to collect useful items, the nomads\n> remained close to the rocks, avoiding the deep desert and the demon\n> worms.\n>\n> Long ago, after the Imperial chemist Shakkad the Wise had remarked on\n> the rejuvenating properties of the obscure spice melange, there had\n> been a small market for the natural substance among offworlders at the\n> Arrakis City spaceport. However, the planet's distance from popular\n> spacing lanes had never made melange an economically attractive item.\n> \"An oddity, not a commodity,\" one surly merchant had told Naib\n> Dhartha. Still, spice was a staple in the food supply, and it must be\n> gathered . . . but only on sands close to the rocks.\n>\n> Dhartha led a party of six across a ridge of packed powder sand that\n> held their footprints as if they were kisses in the dust. Loose white\n> cloths around their heads and faces exposed only their eyes; their\n> cloaks blew in the breeze, revealing equipment belts, tools, and\n> weapons. Dhartha snugged the cloth higher over his nose to keep from\n> breathing grit. He scratched the tattoo etched so painstakingly onto\n> his cheek, then narrowed his eyes, always alert for danger.\n>\n> No one thought to watch the clear morning skies until they heard a\n> faint whistle growing quickly into a howl. To Naib Dhartha, it sounded\n> like a woman who had just learned of her husband's death.\n>\n> Looking up, he saw a silvery bullet that tore through the atmosphere,\n> then recognized the unexpected hum and whine of thrusters. A\n> bubble-shaped object plummeted through the sky, spun about and\n> see-sawed in the open air as if choosing a place to land. Quad engines\n> slowed its descent. Then, less\n>\n> than a kilometer from where the scavenging party stood, the object\n> slammed into the dunes like a fist thumping into the stomach of a\n> dishonest merchant. A spray of dust and sand shot upward, embracing a\n> tendril of dark soot.\n>\n> The Naib stood stiffly and stared, while his men began to jabber\n> excitedly. Young Ebrahim was as enthralled as Dhartha's own son,\n> Mahmad; both boys wanted to race out and investigate.\n>\n> Mahmad was a good lad, respectful and cautious. But Dhartha had a low\n> opinion of Ebrahim, who liked to tell stories and talk of imaginary\n> exploits. Then there was the incident in which tribal water had been\n> stolen, an unforgivable crime. Initially the Naib had thought two boys\n> were involved, Ebrahim and Selim. But Ebrahim had been quick to\n> disavow any responsibility and to point the finger at the other boy.\n> Selim had seemed shocked at the accusation, but had not denied it.\n>\n> In addition, Ebrahim's father had stepped forward to make a generous\n> deal with Dhartha to save his son . . . and so the orphan boy had\n> received the ultimate sentence of banishment. Not much of a loss to\n> the tribe. A Naib often had to make such difficult decisions.\n>\n> Now, as the scavengers looked at Dhartha, their bright eyes glinting\n> between folds of dirty white cloth, he knew he could not ignore the\n> opportunity of this crashed ship, whatever it was. \"We must go see\n> this thing,\" he called.\n>\n> His men rushed across the sands, boisterous Ebrahim and Mahmad in the\n> lead, hurrying toward the pillar of dust that marked the impact.\n> Dhartha did not like to stray far from the sheltering rock, but the\n> desert beckoned them toward a rich, alien treasure.\n>\n> The nomads crested one dune, slid down the slipface, and scurried up\n> another. By the time they reached the impact crater, they were all\n> winded, panting hot breaths that were smothered by the cloths over\n> their mouths. The Naib and his men stood on the high lip of excavated\n> sand. Glassy smears of superheated silica had splattered like saliva\n> on the ground.\n>\n> Inside the pit lay a mechanical object the size of two men, with\n> protrusions and components that hummed and moved, awakening now that\n> it had landed. The carbon fiber-encased body still smoked from the\n> heat of reentry. A spacecraft, perhaps?\n>\n> One of Dhartha's men stepped back, making a warding sign with his\n> fingers. Overzealous Ebrahim, though, bent forward. The Naib put a\n> hand on Mahmad's left arm, cautioning his son. Let the foolish one\n> take the risks.\n>\n> The crashed pod was too small to carry passengers. The lights blinked\n> brighter, and the probe's sides opened like dragon wings to expose\n> mechanical limbs, articulated claws, and complex machinery inside.\n> Scanners, processors, engines of investigation and destruction.\n> Mirrorlike power converters spread out in the glare of the sun.\n>\n> Ebrahim slid down the churned sand at the edge of the pit. \"Imagine\n> what this would be worth at the spaceport, Naib! If I get to it first,\n> I should receive the largest salvage share.\"\n>\n> Dhartha wanted to argue with the exuberant youth, but when he saw that\n> no one--- except for his own son--- looked eager to join Ebrahim, he\n> nodded. \"If successful, you'll get an extra share.\" Even if the\n> falling object was completely ruined, the nomads could work the pure\n> metal for their own purposes.\n>\n> The brash young man stopped halfway down the loose slope, looking\n> suspiciously at the device, which continued to vibrate and thump.\n> Flexible components extruded arms and legs, while strange lenses and\n> mirrors rotated at the ends of flexible carbon fiber tentacles. The\n> probe seemed to be assessing its surroundings, as if it didn't\n> comprehend where it had landed.\n>\n> The machine paid no attention to the surreptitious humans, until\n> Ebrahim dug a stone from the slumping side of the crater. He called\n> out \"Ai! Ai!\" then hurled the rock. It struck the composite material\n> of the probe's side with an echoing *clunk*.\n>\n> The mechanical lander froze, then turned its lenses and scanners\n> toward the human standing all alone. Ebrahim hunched on bent knees in\n> the yielding sand.\n>\n> Blinding hot light erupted from one of the lenses. A gout of coherent\n> fire engulfed Ebrahim and blew him backward in a crackling cloud of\n> incinerated flesh and bones. A wad of smoldering garments struck the\n> top of the crater, along with charred pieces of his hands and feet.\n>\n> Mahmad screamed for his friend, and Dhartha immediately yelled for the\n> men to retreat. They stumbled back down the outside of the crater and\n> fled through the soft gully between dunes. Half a kilometer away,\n> safe, they climbed to a sandy crest high enough that they could look\n> back toward the pit. The men prayed and made superstitious gestures,\n> and Dhartha raised his clenched right fist. Foolish Ebrahim had drawn\n> the attention of the mechanical thing and had paid with his life.\n>\n> From a distance, the would-be scavengers watched. The crashed probe\n> paid them no further heed. Instead, with thumping and clattering, the\n> machine seemed to be assembling itself, building structures around its\n> core. Scooping hands drew sand into a resource-production hopper in\n> its belly and extruded glasslike rods that it used for structural\n> supports. The machine added new components, building itself larger,\n> and finally began digging its way out of the pit. It pounded and\n> hammered, making a great deal of racket.\n>\n> Dhartha remained perplexed. Though he was a leader, he had no idea\n> what to do. Such a thing was beyond his ken. Perhaps someone at the\n> spaceport would know, but he hated to rely on outworlders. Besides,\n> this thing might be valuable, and he didn't want to surrender his\n> salvage.\n>\n> \"Father, look.\" Mahmad gestured toward the wasteland of sand. \"See,\n> that machine demon will pay for killing my friend.\"\n>\n> Dhartha saw the telltale ripple, the stirring of a behemoth beneath\n> the sands. The crashed probe continued its pounding, rhythmic motion\n> with a clattering of components, oblivious to its surroundings. The\n> assembled mechanism raised itself, a monstrous composite of\n> crystalline materials and\n>\n> silica struts reinforced by carbon-fiber beams converted from its own\n> hull and support girders.\n>\n> The sandworm came in fast, tunneling just beneath the surface until\n> its head rose up. The mouth was a huge shovel larger than the impact\n> crater.\n>\n> The robotic probe waved its sensor arms and weapons lenses, sensing it\n> was being attacked, but not understanding how. Several white-hot\n> blasts of fire penetrated the loose ground.\n>\n> The worm swallowed the mechanical demon whole. Then the sinuous desert\n> creature burrowed beneath the dust again like a sea serpent seeking\n> deeper waters. . . .\n>\n> Naib Dhartha and his men remained petrified on the dunes. If they\n> turned and ran now, their vibrations would call the sandworm back for\n> another meal.\n>\n> Soon enough, they saw the worm trail heading outward, returning to the\n> deep desert. The crater was gone, along with all evidence of the\n> mechanical construction. Not even a scrap of foolish Ebrahim's body\n> remained.\n>\n> Shaking his head with its long black ponytail, Dhartha turned to his\n> shocked companions. \"This will make a legendary story, a magnificent\n> ballad to be sung in our caves in the dark of night. . . .\" He drew a\n> deepbreath and turned around. \"Though I doubt anyone will ever believe\n> us.\"\n>\n> *The future? I hate it because I will not be there.*\n\n--- JUNO,\n\n*Lives of the Titans*\n\n> **A**fter the unexpected encounter with the League Armada at Giedi\n> Prime, the battered *Dream Voyager* took an extra month to limp back\n> to Earth for repairs. Because of the slow pace caused by the damage,\n> Seurat had immediately dispatched his emergency buoy, relaying to\n> Omnius the dire news of the fall of the newest Synchronized World and\n> the loss of the Titan Barbarossa. By now the evermind must know what\n> had happened.\n>\n> The robot captain did his best to repair or bypass the ship's damaged\n> systems and seal off sections to protect his fragile human copilot.\n> General Agamemnon would not be pleased if his biological son were\n> injured. Besides, Seurat had developed a certain fondness for Vorian\n> Atreides. . . .\n>\n> Vor insisted on donning an environment suit and crawling outside the\n> update ship to inspect the hull. Seurat tethered him with two lines,\n> while three inspector drones accompanied him. When the young man saw\n> the blackened wound where the rebellious humans had fired upon them,\n> he once again felt a sense of shame. Intent only on delivering the\n> vital Omnius updates, Seurat had committed no aggressive act against\n> these *hrethgir*, yet they had attacked him. Wild humans were without\n> honor.\n>\n> Agamemnon and his friend Barbarossa had brought the unruly populace of\n> Giedi Prime into the sweeping embrace of Omnius, yet the *hrethgir*\n> had spurned the greater civilization of the Synchronized Worlds,\n> making a martyr of Barbarossa in the process. His father would be\n> deeply disturbed at the loss of such a close friend, one of the last\n> remaining Titans.\n>\n> Vor himself could have been killed, his soft and breakable human form\n> destroyed without ever having the chance to become a neo-cymek. A\n> single blow from the Armada could have erased all of Vor's potential,\n> all of his future work. He could not update himself or back up his\n> memories and\n>\n> experiences, as a machine could. He'd be lost, just like the Giedi\n> Prime-- Omnius. Just like the other twelve sons of Agamemnon. The\n> thought sickened him, and he shuddered.\n>\n> On their return journey, Seurat tried to cheer Vor with ridiculous\n> jokes, as if nothing had happened. The robot commended his companion\n> for quick thinking and tactical innovation in outwitting the\n> *hrethgir* officer. Vor's deceit in pretending to be a rebellious\n> human who had captured a thinking-machine vessel--- what an outr\u00e9\n> scenario!--- had given them a few moments of valuable time, and his\n> decoy projections had allowed them to escape. Perhaps it would even be\n> taught to others in the trustee schools on Earth.\n>\n> Vor, however, cared most about what his father might say. The approval\n> of the great Agamemnon would make everything all right.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WHEN THE *DREAM VOYAGER* landed at Earth's central spaceport, Vorian\n> hurried down the ramp, eyes alert, face eager--- then crestfallen when\n> he saw no sign of the Titan general.\n>\n> Vor swallowed hard. Unless vital matters intervened, his father always\n> came to greet him. These were rare moments they had together, when\n> they could exchange ideas, talk about plans and dreams. Vor comforted\n> himself with the thought that Agamemnon probably had important\n> business for Omnius.\n>\n> Robotic maintenance crews and repair machinery trundled forward to\n> inspect the damaged ship. One of the multicomponent machines paused in\n> its assessment, broke away, and hummed toward him. \"Vorian Atreides,\n> Agamemnon has commanded you to meet him in the conditioning facility.\n> Report there immediately.\"\n>\n> The young human brightened. Letting the robot return to its work, he\n> walked off briskly. When he could contain himself no longer, he began\n> to run. . . .\n>\n> Though he attempted to exercise during the long voyages with Seurat,\n> Vor's biological muscles were weaker than a machine's, and he tired\n> quickly. Another reminder of his mortality, his fragility, and the\n> inferiority of natural biology. It only increased his desire to wear a\n> powerful neo-cymek body someday and discard this imperfect human form.\n>\n> His lungs burning, Vor rushed into the gleaming chrome-and-plaz\n> chamber where his father's brain canister was regularly polished and\n> recharged with electrafluid. As soon as the young man entered the\n> cold, well-lit room, two robot guards folded in behind him, ominously\n> blocking egress. In the center of the chamber stood a mechanical,\n> human-shaped colossus that Agamemnon now wore. The behemoth took two\n> steps forward, stabilizer-feet hammering against the hard floor. He\n> dwarfed his son, towering three times Vorian's height.\n>\n> \"I have been waiting for you, my son. Everything is prepared. What\n> caused your delay?\"\n>\n> Intimidated, Vor looked up at the preservation canister. \"I hurried\n> here, Father. My ship landed only an hour ago.\"\n>\n> \"I understand the *Dream Voyager* was damaged at Giedi Prime, attacked\n> by the human rebels that murdered Barbarossa and recaptured the\n> world.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, sir.\" Vor knew better than to waste the Titan's time with\n> unnecessary details. The general would already have received a full\n> report. \"I will answer any questions you might have, Father.\"\n>\n> \"I have no questions, only *commands*.\" Instead of instructing his son\n> to begin the process of grooming and polishing his components,\n> Agamemnon raised a gauntleted hand, clutched Vorian by the chest, and\n> pushed him forcefully against an upright table.\n>\n> Vor was slammed against the smooth surface and felt a burst of pain.\n> His father was so powerful that he could accidentally break bones,\n> sever the spine. \"What is it, Father? What---\"\n>\n> Holding him immobile, Agamemnon clamped on wrist bindings, a waist\n> restraint, and ankle cuffs. Helpless now, Vor twisted his head to look\n> at what his father was doing and saw that complex devices had been\n> brought into the chamber. With trepidation he noted hollow cylinders\n> filled with bluish fluids, neuromechanical pumps, and chittering\n> machines that waved questing sensor tips in the air.\n>\n> \"Please, Father.\" Vor's deepest fears careened through his mind,\n> ricocheting off the pain, each impact increasing his doubts and\n> terrors. \"What have I done wrong?\"\n>\n> Showing no readable expression on his head turret, Agamemnon extended\n> an array of long needles toward his son's squirming body. The steel\n> points penetrated his chest, poking between his ribs, seeking out and\n> finding his lungs, his heart. Two silver shafts pierced his throat.\n> Blood oozed out everywhere. Vor's neck sinews bulged as he clenched\n> his jaw and curled back his lips, biting back a scream.\n>\n> But the scream broke through anyway.\n>\n> The cymek manipulated the machinery connected to Vorian's body,\n> increasing the pain beyond all imaginable levels. Convinced that he\n> had failed somehow, Vor assumed it was his time to die--- like the\n> twelve unknown brothers who had preceded him. Now, it seemed, Vorian\n> had not lived up to Agamemnon's expectations.\n>\n> Agony swelled higher, with no crest in sight. His scream became a\n> prolonged wail, as acid-colored fluids were pumped into his body. Soon\n> even his vocal cords gave out, and his shriek continued only in his\n> mind . . .\n>\n> yet it continued nevertheless. He could endure no more. He could not\n> imagine the grievous injury his stretched and torn body must already\n> have endured.\n>\n> When finally the torture concluded and Vor came back to himself, he\n> didn't know how long he had been unconscious--- perhaps even lost in\n> the cloak of death. His body felt as if it had been crushed into a\n> ball and then stretched back into the form of a man.\n>\n> The colossus shape of Agamemnon loomed over him, a galaxy of optic\n> threads glittering on his body. Even though the remnants of\n> excruciating pain echoed inside his skull, Vor resisted crying out.\n> His father had kept him alive after all, for his own reasons. He\n> stared into the Titan's implacable metal face and could only hope that\n> his father had not revived him just to inflict more agony.\n>\n> *What have I done wrong?*\n>\n> Yet the ancient cymek did not have murder on his mind. Instead he\n> said, \"I am exceedingly pleased with your actions aboard the *Dream\n> Voyager*, Vorian. I have analyzed Seurat's report and determined that\n> your tactical prowess in escaping from the League Armada was\n> innovative and unexpected.\"\n>\n> Vorian couldn't understand the context of his father's words. They\n> seemed unrelated to the tortures the general had inflicted on him.\n>\n> \"No thinking machine would have considered such a deceitful trick. I\n> doubt even another trustee would have been so quick to think of the\n> ruse. In fact, Omnius's summation concludes that any other action\n> would likely have resulted in the capture or destruction of the *Dream\n> Voyager*. Seurat would never have been capable of surviving by\n> himself. You not only saved the ship, you saved the Omnius update\n> spheres and returned them intact.\" Agamemnon paused, then reiterated.\n> \"Yes, I am exceedingly pleased, my son. You have the potential of\n> becoming a great cymek someday.\"\n>\n> Vor's raw throat convulsed as he tried to force out words. The\n> needle-studded cradle had been yanked away, and now Agamemnon released\n> the body restraints that held him against the hard surface. Vorian's\n> watery muscles could not support him, and he drooped like a rag,\n> sliding down until he pooled on his knees on the floor. Finally he\n> choked, \"Then why was I tortured? Why have you punished me?\"\n>\n> Agamemnon simulated a laugh. \"When I choose to punish you, son, you\n> will know. That was a *reward*. Omnius allowed me to grant you this\n> rare\n>\n> gift. In fact, no other human in all the Synchronized Worlds has been\n> so honored.\"\n>\n> \"But how, Father? Please explain it to me. My mind is still\n> throbbing.\" His voice hitched.\n>\n> \"What are a few moments of pain, in comparison with the gift you have\n> received?\" The colossus paced back and forth across the sparkling\n> maintenance room, shaking the floor and the walls. \"Unfortunately, I\n> was unable to convince Omnius to convert you into a neo-cymek--- you\n> are too young--- but I am sure the time will come. I wanted you to\n> serve at my side\n>\n> --- more than a trustee, but as my true successor.\" His sparkling\n> optic threads glowed brighter. \"Instead, I have done the next best\n> thing for you.\"\n>\n> The cymek general explained that he had given Vorian a rigorous\n> biotech treatment, a cellular replacement system that would\n> dramatically extend his life as a human. \"Geriatric specialists\n> developed the technique in the Old Empire . . . though to what purpose\n> I cannot fathom. Those oafs did nothing productive during their normal\n> lifespans, so why should they want to live for centuries longer and\n> accomplish even less? Through new proteins, rejection of free\n> radicals, more efficient cellular repair mechanisms, they prolonged\n> their pointless existences. Most of them were murdered in the\n> rebellions when we Titans cemented our control.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon swiveled at his torso joint. \"While we still wore human\n> bodies at the beginning of our rule, all twenty Titans underwent the\n> biotech life extension, just like you, so I am quite familiar with the\n> level of pain you endured. We *needed* to live for centuries, because\n> we required that much time to reassert vision and competent leadership\n> upon the waning Old Empire. Even after we converted ourselves into\n> cymeks, the process helped prevent our ancient biological brains from\n> degenerating because of our extreme age.\"\n>\n> His mechanical body strode closer. \"This life-extension process is our\n> little secret, Vorian. The League of Nobles would tear themselves into\n> a frenzy if they knew we had such technology.\" Agamemnon made a\n> wistful sound,\n>\n> almost a sigh. \"But beware, my son: Even such enhancements cannot\n> protect you against accidents or outright assassination attempts. As,\n> unfortunately, Barbarossa recently discovered.\"\n>\n> Vor finally struggled shakily to his feet. He located a water\n> dispenser, gulped a beaker of cool liquid, and felt his heartbeat\n> slowing.\n>\n> \"Astonishing events await you, my son. Your life is no longer a candle\n> in the wind. You have time to experience many things, important\n> things.\"\n>\n> The hulking cymek stalked over to a harness and used an intricate\n> network of artificial hands and clamps extruded from the metal wall to\n> link to the thoughtrodes of his brain canister. Flexible lifting arms\n> raised the cylinder out of the colossus body core and shuttled it over\n> to one of the chrome pedestals.\n>\n> \"Now you are one step closer to your potential, Vorian,\" Agamemnon\n> said through a wall speaker, detached from the mobile body.\n>\n> Though weak and still in pain, Vor knew what his father expected of\n> him now. He hurried to the conditioning devices and with trembling\n> hands attached power cables to the magsockets of the translucent brain\n> chamber. The bluish electrafluid seemed full of mental energy.\n>\n> Trying to restore a sense of normalcy amid the clamoring disbelief at\n> what had just happened to him, Vor went through his habitual grooming\n> duties, tending his father's mechanical systems. Lovingly, the young\n> man gazed at the wrinkled mass of brain, the ancient mind so full of\n> profound ideas and difficult decisions, as expressed in the general's\n> extensive memoirs. Each time he read them, Vor hoped to understand his\n> complex father better.\n>\n> He wondered if Agamemnon had kept him in the dark to play a cruel joke\n> on him, or to challenge his resolve. Vor would always accept whatever\n> the cymek general commanded, would never try to flee. Now that the\n> agony was over, he hoped he had passed whatever test his father had\n> administered.\n>\n> As Vor continued the patient grooming of the preservation tank,\n> Agamemnon spoke softly, a susurration. \"You are very quiet, my son.\n> What do you think about the great gift you have received?\"\n>\n> The young man paused a moment, not certain how to respond. Agamemnon\n> was often impulsive and difficult to understand, but he rarely acted\n> without a larger purpose in mind. Vor could only hope to comprehend\n> the overall picture someday, the grand tapestry.\n>\n> \"Thank you, Father,\" he finally said, \"for giving me more time to\n> accomplish everything you want me to do.\"\n>\n> *Why do humans spend so much time worrying about what they call \"moral\n> issues\"? It is one of the many mysteries of their behavior.*\n\n--- ERASMUS,\n\n*Reflections on Sentient Biologicals*\n\n> **T**he identical twin girls looked peaceful and asleep, side by side,\n> like little angels in a cozy bed.

Even without\n> physical bodies, the cymek minds could still experience intense\n> pleasure.\n>\n> Automated lifters disengaged his preservation canister smoothly from\n> its walking body, then set the thinking core on a clean chrome\n> pedestal beside the container that held Juno's pinkish gray brain.\n> With the accessible optic threads and computer comparison grids, he\n> recognized the distinctive folds and lobes of his lover's mind. *Still\n> beautiful after all these centuries*.\n>\n> Agamemnon remembered how lovely she had been back in the beginning:\n> obsidian-black hair that shimmered with blue highlights. Her nose had\n> been pointed, her face narrow, with eyebrows that arched in a\n> mysterious way. He always thought of her as Cleopatra, another\n> military genius from the mists of history, just like the first\n> Agamemnon in the Trojan War.\n>\n> Long ago, during the eyeblink of time when he had worn a frail human\n> physique, Agamemnon had fallen in love with this woman. Though Juno\n> was extremely desirable sexually, he had been attracted to her mind\n> before ever meeting her in person. He had first become aware of her on\n> a complex virtual network through tactical simulations and wargames he\n> had fought with her on the Old Empire's docile computers. The two of\n> them had been teenagers then, back when age mattered.\n>\n> As a boy, Agamemnon had been raised on pampered Earth, with the name\n> of Andrew Skouros. His parents had led a hedonistic but passionless\n> lifestyle, as had so many other citizens. They existed, they dabbled .\n> . . but none of them really *lived*. Across the depths of time, he\n> barely remembered the faces of his parents. All weak and feeble humans\n> looked the same to him now.\n>\n> Andrew Skouros had always been restless. He had asked uncomfortable\n> questions that no one could answer. While the others played frivolous\n> parlor games, the young man dug into archival databases, where he\n> uncovered history and legends. He found heroic tales of real people\n> who had existed so long ago they seemed as mythical as the race of\n> Titans, the earliest gods overthrown by Zeus and a pantheon of Greek\n> deities. He analyzed military conquests and came to understand tactics\n> at a time when it was an obsolete skill in the peace-strangled Empire.\n>\n> Under the alias \"Agamemnon,\" he became interested in strategic games\n> played across the computer network that monitored the activities of\n> ennui-enslaved humanity. There he had encountered another person as\n> skilled and talented as himself, a rare soulmate who shared his\n> restless interests. The mysterious player's wild and unexpected ideas\n> caused her campaigns to fail as often as they succeeded--- but her\n> surprising successes more than made up for the spectacular failures.\n> Her intriguing alias was \"Juno,\" taken from the queen of the Roman\n> gods, wife of Jupiter.\n>\n> Drawn together by their common ambition, their relationship was fiery\n> and challenging, more than just sex. They pleasured themselves by\n> developing\n>\n> thought-experiments. It was a game at first . . . and then much more\n> than that.\n>\n> Their lives changed dramatically when they had heard Tlaloc speak.\n>\n> The offworld visionary, with his disturbing, chastising accusations\n> against complacent humanity on Earth, made the two young schemers\n> realize that their plans could blossom into more than just imaginative\n> adventures.\n>\n> Juno, whose real name was Julianna Parhi, had brought the three of\n> them together. She and Andrew Skouros arranged to speak with Tlaloc,\n> who was excited to learn that they shared his dreams. \"We may be few,\"\n> Tlaloc had said, \"but in Earth's forests full of deadwood, three\n> matches may be enough to spark a conflagration.\"\n>\n> Meeting secretly, the rebellious trio plotted to overthrow the\n> sleeping Empire. Using Andrew's military expertise, they saw that a\n> small investment of hardware and manpower could take over many worlds\n> that had fallen into apathetic stupor. With a little luck and\n> acceptable tactics, like-minded leaders could form an iron grip around\n> the Old Empire. In fact, if the plans were properly set in motion, the\n> conquerors could achieve victory before anyone even noticed.\n>\n> \"It is for humanity's own good,\" Tlaloc had said, his eyes sparkling.\n> \"And for ours,\" Juno added. \"Just a little.\"\n>\n> In one of her innovative plans, Juno utilized the pervasive network of\n> thinking machines and their servile robots. The docile computers had\n> been given artificial intelligence to watch over every aspect of human\n> society, but Julianna saw them as an invasion army already in place .\n> . . if only they could be reprogrammed, given a taste for conquest and\n> human ambition. It was then that they had brought in a computer\n> specialist named Vilhelm Jayther--- who called himself Barbarossa on\n> computer networks--- to implement the technical details.\n>\n> Thus began the Time of Titans, during which a handful of enthusiastic\n> humans controlled the sleeping populace. They had work to do, an\n> empire to rule.\n>\n> During their planning stages, Julianna Parhi often queried a reluctant\n> Cogitor advisor, Eklo. While consulting the ancient Cogitor, one of\n> many spiritual minds who contemplated esoteric questions, she had seen\n> the possibilities of living as a disembodied brain. Not just for\n> introspection, but for action. She realized the advantages a *cymek*\n> tyrant would have over simple humans, able to switch mechanical bodies\n> as circumstances changed. As cymeks, the Titans could live and rule\n> for thousands of years.\n>\n> Perhaps that would be long enough.\n>\n> Agamemnon had immediately agreed with Juno's concept, though he faced\n> a primitive fear of the surgery itself. He and Juno knew that as the\n> Titans experienced the dangers of the universe and the fragility of\n> their human bodies, they would all come around.\n>\n> To show faith in his lover, Agamemnon was the first to undergo the\n> cymek process. He and Juno had spent a last heated night together,\n> naked and touching, storing memories of nerve sensations that would\n> have to last for millennia. Juno had tossed her raven hair, given him\n> a final, tender kiss, and led him into the surgical chamber. There,\n> computerized medical apparatus, robotic surgeons, and dozens of\n> life-support systems waited for him.\n>\n> The Cogitor Eklo had observed and assisted, offering advice whenever\n> necessary, providing precise instructions for the robotic surgeons.\n> Juno had watched her lover, eyes misty as she witnessed the\n> transformation process. Agamemnon feared that she would become\n> squeamish after that and renege on her own plans. But once his brain\n> hung suspended in dynamic electrafluid, once the thoughtrodes were\n> activated and he could \"see\" again through a galaxy of optic threads,\n> Juno was there admiring him, studying the brain canister.\n>\n> She had touched his transparent case with her fingertips. Agamemnon\n> watched it all, focusing and adjusting his new and unfamiliar sensors,\n>\n> enthralled with the ability to observe everything at once.\n>\n> A week later, when he felt competent enough with his new mechanical\n> systems, Agamemnon had returned the favor, watching over Juno as the\n> robotic surgeons sawed open her skull and removed her talented brain,\n> discarding forever the fallible female body of Julianna Parhi. . . .\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> CENTURIES LATER, EVEN without biological bodies, he and Juno remained\n> side by side on their chrome pedestals, connected by receptors and\n> stimulus patches.\n>\n> Agamemnon knew precisely which parts of Juno's brain to pulse in order\n> to activate pleasure centers, and how long to maintain the\n> stimulation. She responded in kind, bringing forth his stored memories\n> of human lovemaking and then amplifying the remembered sensations,\n> stunning him with new heights of euphoria. He struck back with a bolt\n> of his own, causing her brain to quiver.\n>\n> Through it all, the information-gathering watcheyes of Omnius observed\n> intently, like a mechanized voyeur. Even in a time such as this,\n> Agamemnon and Juno were never alone.\n>\n> She pleasured him twice more, making his mind throb; he wanted her to\n> stop so that he could rest, but also longed for her to continue.\n> Agamemnon reciprocated, causing a thin, vibrating sound to pulse from\n> the speakers attached to the canisters, an eerie warbling music that\n> symbolized their merging orgasms. He could barely think through the\n> haze of delight.\n>\n> But his brooding anger continued in the background. Though Omnius\n> allowed him and Juno to have their ecstasy as often as they wished,\n> Agamemnon would have derived even greater pleasure if they could\n> permanently escape the domination of the damned thinking machines.\n>\n> *I fear that Norma will never amount to anything. How does that\n> reflect on me and my own legacy to humanity?*\n>\n> --- ZUFA CENVA\n>\n> **D**uring the tedious month-long journey across space to visit her\n> daughter on Poritrin, Zufa Cenva had plenty of time to ponder what she\n> would say when she arrived. She would rather have been spending so\n> many days and weeks elsewhere on her more important work. The loss of\n> dear Heoma weighed like a hot stone inside her chest. Ever since the\n> first devastating attack against the cymeks on Giedi Prime, Zufa had\n> been planning further strikes with her other Sorceress weapons.\n>\n> While most members of the League gave credit to Savant Holtzman for\n> the portable scrambler projectors, she had heard whispers that Norma\n> herself may have inspired the design. Could her oddball daughter have\n> done something so remarkable? Not as great as a psychic storm\n> obliterating cymeks, but still respectable. *Perhaps I have been blind\n> after all.* Zufa had never wanted Norma to fail, but had given up hope\n> by now. Maybe things could change in their relationship. *Should I\n> embrace her? Does she deserve my support and encouragement, or will\n> she make me ashamed of her?*\n>\n> These were uncertain times.\n>\n> As Zufa stepped off the transport in Starda, she encountered a\n> delegation waiting to greet her, complete with ornately garbed Dragoon\n> guards, their gold-scale armor immaculate. Ruddy-faced Lord Niko Bludd\n> himself led the group, his beard intricately curled, his clothes\n> perfumed and colorful.\n>\n> \"Poritrin is honored by the visit of a Sorceress!\" The noble stepped\n> forward on the mosaic tile floor. Bludd wore a dashing ceremonial\n> costume with broad carmine lapels, frilly white cuffs, and golden\n> shoes. A ceremonial sword hung at his waist, though he had probably\n> never used a blade for anything more dangerous than cutting cheese.\n>\n> She'd never had any use for frippery when there was work to be done,\n> and Bludd's arrival surprised her. She had hoped to conclude her\n> business with Norma unobtrusively and then quickly return to Rossak.\n> She and her dedicated psychic warriors must prepare another mental\n> strike against the cymeks.\n>\n> \"The shuttle captain transmitted a message that you were coming,\n> Madame Cenva,\" Bludd said, as he guided her through the terminal. \"We\n> barely had time to put together a reception for you. You are here to\n> see your daughter, I presume?\" Niko Bludd grinned above his curled\n> reddish beard. \"We are very proud of how much she is helping Savant\n> Holtzman. He considers her quite indispensible.\"\n>\n> \"Indeed?\" Zufa tried to control her skeptical frown.\n>\n> \"We invited Norma to join us today, but she is deeply engrossed in\n> important work for Savant Holtzman. She seemed to think that you would\n> understand why she could not meet you herself.\"\n>\n> Zufa felt as if she had been slapped. \"I have been en route for a\n> month. If *I* can make the time, then a mere . . . lab assistant can\n> arrange to pick me up.\"\n>\n> Outside the spaceport, a chauffeur guided her to a lavish airbarge,\n> and the Dragoon guards took their places at the rails. \"We will\n> transport you directly to Holtzman's laboratories.\" When Bludd seated\n> himself beside her, she wrinkled her nose at his strong body perfumes.\n> He extended a small package to her, which she didn't want.\n>\n> With a sigh of exasperation, Zufa sat rigidly in the comfortable seat\n> as the aircraft proceeded away from the spaceport. Removing the\n> package's silver wrapping paper, Zufa found a bottle of river water\n> and an exquisitely woven Poritrin towel.\n>\n> Despite her lack of interest, the flamboyant noble insisted on\n> explaining. \"It is traditional for honored guests to wash their hands\n> in the water of the Isana and dry themselves on our fine linen.\"\n>\n> She made no move to use the gifts. Beneath the flying barge, water\n> vessels traveled downriver toward the sprawling delta city, where\n> grains, metals, and manufactured supplies were distributed to Poritrin\n> suppliers. In the brown mudflats, hundreds of slaves worked in the\n> muck to plant paddies of shellfish. The sight made her feel even more\n> unsettled than she already was.\n>\n> \"The residence of Savant Holtzman is just ahead,\" Bludd said, pointing\n> to a high bluff. \"I am sure your daughter will be pleased to see you.\"\n>\n> *Has she ever been pleased to see me?* Zufa wondered. She tried to\n> calm herself with mental exercises, but anxiety intruded.\n>\n> With a sweep of her long black dress, she stepped away from the\n> ostentatious airbarge as soon as it set down on Holtzman's landing\n> deck. \"Lord Bludd, I have private business to discuss with my\n> daughter. I'm sure you understand.\" Without further farewell, Zufa\n> marched alone up the broad patio steps to the mansion, leaving a\n> befuddled Bludd behind her. She waved her long arms, shooing him away.\n>\n> Her telepathic senses attuned, Zufa entered the dwelling as if she\n> belonged there. Holtzman's vestibule was cluttered with disarrayed\n> boxes, books, and instruments. Either the household staff did not do\n> their work, or the inventor had forbidden them to \"organize\" too much.\n>\n> Picking a path through the obstacles, Zufa strode into a long hallway,\n> then searched rooms and demanded information from anyone she met until\n> she found her daughter. Finally, the tall and intimidating Sorceress\n> entered an auxiliary laboratory building, where she saw a high stool\n> at an angled lightstrip table that held blueprint films. No sign of\n> Norma.\n>\n> She noticed an open door that led out to a balcony, then saw a shadow,\n> heard something move. Gliding to the balcony, Zufa was shocked to see\n> her daughter perched on top of the railing. Norma gripped a red plaz\n> container in her small hands.\n>\n> \"What are you doing?\" Zufa asked. \"Get down from there immediately!\"\n>\n> Startled, Norma glanced at her looming mother, then clasped the object\n> tightly and leaped off the railing out into the open air.\n>\n> \"No!\" Zufa shouted. But it was too late.\n>\n> Rushing to the edge, the Sorceress saw to her horror that the balcony\n> jutted out over a high bluff that dropped to the river, far below. The\n> small-statured young woman tumbled through the air, falling.\n>\n> Suddenly, Norma paused in midair and spun in a peculiar fashion. She\n> called, \"See for yourself, it works! You arrived just in time!\" Then,\n> like a feather on the wind, the girl drifted upward. The red device\n> lifted her back toward the balcony, like an invisible hand.\n>\n> Norma reached the level of the railing, and her angry mother yanked\n> her back onto the balcony. \"Why would you try something so dangerous?\n> Doesn't Savant Holtzman prefer you to employ helpers for this sort of\n> test?\"\n>\n> Norma frowned. \"They have *slaves* here, not helpers. Besides, it is\n> my own invention, and I wanted to do it myself. I knew it would work.\"\n>\n> Zufa did not want to argue. \"You came all the way to Poritrin and used\n> the League's best engineering laboratories to design some sort of . .\n> . flying toy?\"\n>\n> \"Hardly, Mother.\" Norma opened the lid of the red plaz unit and\n> adjusted electronics inside. \"It is a variation on Savant Holtzman's\n> theories, a repelling, or suspensor field. I expect him to be\n> delighted by it.\"\n>\n> \"Oh, I am, I am!\" The scientist appeared suddenly and stood behind\n> Zufa. He quickly introduced himself, then looked at Norma's new\n> gadget. \"I'll show it to Lord Bludd and see what he thinks of the\n> commercial possibilities. I'm sure he'll want a patent in his own\n> name.\"\n>\n> Zufa looked on, still recovering from the shock of Norma's \"fall,\"\n> trying to see practical applications of her daughter's invention.\n> Could such a thing be\n>\n> modified to carry troops or heavy objects? She doubted it.\n>\n> Norma set down the red-plaz generator and crossed the room with her\n> awkward, waddling gait. She climbed her high stool to reach the\n> blueprint films on the slanted light table, where she sifted through\n> pages. \"I've figured out how this principle can also be used on\n> illumination devices. The suspensor field can float lights and power\n> them with residual energy. I have all the calculations . . .\n> somewhere.\"\n>\n> \"Floating lights?\" Zufa said, in scornful tone. \"For what, a picnic?\n> Tens of thousands died in the cymek attack on Zimia, millions were\n> enslaved on Giedi Prime, and you live in secluded comfort--- making\n> floating *lights*?\"\n>\n> Norma gave her mother a condescending look, as if *Zufa* was the\n> foolish one. \"Think beyond the obvious, Mother. A war needs more than\n> just weapons. Robots can alter their optic sensors to see in the dark,\n> but humans must have light to see. Hundreds of these suspensor lights\n> could be dispersed in a nighttime combat zone, negating any advantage\n> the machines might have. Savant Holtzman and I think along those lines\n> every day.\"\n>\n> The scientist nodded, quick to concur with her. \"Or, for commercial\n> uses, they could be designed in a number of styles, even tuned to any\n> color or shade.\"\n>\n> Norma sat on her stool like a gnome perched on a throne. Her brown\n> eyes sparkled with excitement. \"I'm sure Lord Bludd will be most\n> pleased.\"\n>\n> Zufa frowned. There were more important issues at stake in this war\n> than pleasing a foppish nobleman. Impatient, she said, \"I came a great\n> distance to see you.\"\n>\n> Norma raised her eyebrows skeptically. \"If you had bothered to see me\n> *before* I departed from Rossak, Mother, you wouldn't have needed to\n> make such a long voyage to soothe your guilt. But you were too busy to\n> notice.\"\n>\n> Uneasy in the midst of a family argument, Tio Holtzman excused\n> himself.\n>\n> The combatants hardly noticed his departure.\n>\n> Zufa had not intended to pick a fight, but now she felt defensive. \"My\n> Sorceresses have proved their abilities in battle. We can exert\n> tremendous power with our minds to eradicate the cymeks. A number of\n> candidates are preparing themselves to offer the ultimate sacrifice if\n> we are called upon to free another machine-dominated world.\" Her pale\n> eyes flashed, and she shook her head. \"But you don't worry about that,\n> do you, Norma--- since you have no telepathic abilities.\"\n>\n> \"I have other skills, Mother. I am making a valuable contribution,\n> too.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, your incomprehensible equations.\" Zufa nodded toward the\n> suspensor field generator on the floor. \"Your life is not at stake.\n> Safe and pampered, you spend your days playing with these *toys*. You\n> have let yourself be blinded by imaginary success.\" But her daughter\n> wasn't the only one. Many people lived in comfort and security while\n> Zufa and her Sorceresses performed dangerous tasks. How could Norma\n> compare her work to *that*? \"When you heard I was coming, Norma, could\n> you not have found time to meet me at the spaceport?\"\n>\n> Norma's tone was deceptively mild as she crossed her arms over her\n> small chest. \"I did not ask you to come here, Mother, because I know\n> you have many important things to do. And *I* have more urgent duties\n> than ferrying unexpected guests around. Besides, I knew Lord Bludd was\n> going to meet you.\"\n>\n> \"Are League nobles your errand boys now?\" Now that she had opened the\n> floodgates of her anger, Zufa couldn't stop the words that came next.\n> \"I only wanted you to make me proud, Norma, despite your deformities.\n> But nothing you do will ever amount to anything. Living here in\n> luxury, what sacrifices do you make? Your vision is too small to be of\n> any real use to humanity.\"\n>\n> Previously, Norma would have crumbled under such an onslaught, her\n> confidence crushed. But her work here with Holtzman, her obvious\n> successes in the technical arena, had given her a new view of herself.\n> Now she looked coolly at her mother. \"Just because I don't fit the\n> image of what\n>\n> you wanted me to be doesn't mean I'm not contributing something\n> essential. Savant Holtzman sees it, and so does Aurelius. You're my\n> own mother--- why can't you?\"\n>\n> With a snort at the mention of Venport's name, Zufa began pacing.\n> \"Aurelius is just a man with hallucinations from the drugs he takes.\"\n>\n> \"I had forgotten how narrow-minded you truly are, Mother,\" Norma said\n> in a level tone. \"Thank you for coming all this way to refresh my\n> memory.\" The girl turned on her stool and resumed her plans and\n> equations. \"I am tempted to summon one of the slaves to escort you\n> out, but I wouldn't want to remove them from their more important\n> work.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> FURIOUS AT HERSELF and her daughter--- and at the wasted time--- Zufa\n> returned to the spaceport. She would stay on Poritrin no longer. To\n> get her mind off her concerns, she concentrated on mental exercises\n> and thought of how her beloved trainees in the jungles were ready to\n> give their utmost to their tasks, without personal considerations.\n>\n> Zufa waited a full day for a military transport that would take her\n> back to Rossak. As she surrounded herself with waves of her own\n> clairvoyant powers, she discovered a rotten weakness on Poritrin, and\n> it had nothing to do with Norma. It was so obvious, she could not\n> avoid it.\n>\n> All around Starda, at loading sites near the spaceport, at the\n> warehouses and mudflats, Zufa detected the individual and collective\n> auras of the downtrodden laborers. She sensed a collective\n> psychological wound, a deep and simmering discontent to which the free\n> Poritrin citizens seemed completely oblivious.\n>\n> The backwash of brooding resentment gave her one more reason to want\n> to get away from this place.\n>\n> *Intuition is a function by which humans see around corners. It is\n> useful for persons who live exposed to dangerous natural conditions.*\n>\n> --- ERASMUS\n\n*Erasmus Dialogues*\n\n> **R**aised as the daughter of the League Viceroy, Serena Butler was\n> accustomed to working hard to serve humanity, looking toward a bright\n> future even against the backdrop of constant war. She had never\n> imagined laboring as a slave inside the household of an enemy robot.\n>\n> From her first glance at Erasmus in the broad entry plaza of the\n> villa, Serena disliked him intensely. Conversely, the thinking machine\n> was intrigued by her. She suspected that his interest was probably a\n> dangerous thing.\n>\n> He chose to wear fine clothes, loose robes and fluffy, ornate furs\n> that made his robot body look absurd. His mirrored face made him\n> appear alien, and his demeanor made her flesh crawl. His relentless\n> curiosity about mankind seemed perverse and unnatural. When he\n> strutted across the plaza toward Serena, his pliable metal mask\n> shifted into a delighted grin.\n>\n> \"You are Serena Butler,\" he said. \"Have you been informed that Giedi\n> Prime was recaptured by the feral humans? Such a disappointment. Why\n> are humans willing to sacrifice so much to maintain their inefficient\n> chaos?\"\n>\n> Serena's heart lifted at news of the liberation, in part because of\n> her own efforts. Xavier had brought the Armada after all, and Brigit\n> Paterson's engineers must have succeeded in activating the secondary\n> shield transmitters. Serena, however, remained enslaved--- and\n> pregnant with Xavier's child. No one even knew where she was or what\n> had happened to her. Xavier and her father must be insane with grief,\n> convinced that the machines had killed her.\n>\n> \"Perhaps it's not surprising that you don't comprehend or value the\n> human concept of freedom,\" she replied. \"For all your convoluted\n> gelcircuitry, you're still just a machine. The understanding wasn't\n> *programmed* into you.\"\n>\n> Her eyes stung at the thought of how much more she wanted to achieve\n> to help other people. On Salusa, she had never taken her family's\n> wealth for granted, feeling a need to earn the blessings bestowed upon\n> her.\n>\n> She asked, \"So, are you inquisitive, or inquisitor?\"\n>\n> \"Perhaps both.\" The robot leaned close to examine her, noting the\n> proud lift of her chin. \"I expect you to offer me many insights.\" He\n> touched her cheek with a cool, flexible finger. \"Lovely skin.\"\n>\n> She forced herself not to pull away. *Resistance must count for\n> something more than a captive's pride*, her mother had once told her.\n> If Serena struggled, Erasmus could hold her with his powerful robotic\n> grasp, or summon mechanized torturing devices. \"My skin is no more\n> lovely than yours,\" she said, \"except mine is not synthetic. My skin\n> was designed by nature, not by the mind of a machine.\"\n>\n> The robot chuckled, a tinny cachination. \"You see, I expect to learn\n> much from you.\" He led her into his lush greenhouses, which she\n> observed with reluctant delight.\n>\n> At the age of ten she had become fascinated with gardening, and had\n> delivered plants, herbs, and sweet exotic fruits to medical centers,\n> refugee complexes, and veteran homes, where she also volunteered her\n> services. Around Zimia, Serena had been renowned for her ability to\n> cultivate beautiful flowers. Under her loving attention, exquisite\n> little Immian roses bloomed, as did Poritrin hibiscus and even the\n> delicate morning violets of distant Kaitain.\n>\n> \"I will have you tend my prized plaza gardens,\" Erasmus said.\n>\n> \"Why can't machines perform such tasks? I'm sure they'd be much more\n> efficient--- or do you just revel in making your 'creators' do the\n> work?\"\n>\n> \"Do you not feel up to the task?\"\n>\n> \"I will do as you command--- for the sake of the plants.\" Pointedly\n> ignoring him, she touched a strangely shaped red and orange flower.\n> \"This looks like a bird of paradise, a pure strain from an ancient\n> stock. According to legend, these plants were favored by the sea kings\n> of Old Earth.\" With a look of defiance, Serena turned back to the\n> robot. \"There, now I have taught you something.\"\n>\n> Erasmus chuckled again, as if replaying a recording. \"Excellent. Now\n> tell me what you were truly thinking.\"\n>\n> She remembered words her father had spoken---*Fear invites aggression;\n> do not show it to a predator*--- and felt emboldened. \"While I was\n> telling you about a beautiful flower, I was thinking that I despise\n> you and all of your kind. I was a free and independent being, until\n> you took it all away from me. Machines stole my home, my life, and the\n> man I love.\"\n>\n> The sentient robot was not at all offended. \"Ah, your lover! Is he the\n> one who impregnated you?\"\n>\n> Serena glared at Erasmus, then made up her mind. Perhaps she could\n> find a way to use this machine's curiosity, turning it against him\n> somehow. \"You will learn the most from me if I cooperate, if I talk\n> freely. I can teach you things you would never learn for yourself.\"\n>\n> \"Excellent.\" The robot seemed genuinely pleased.\n>\n> Serena's eyes grew hard. \"But I expect something from you in return.\n> Guarantee the safety of my unborn baby. Allow me to raise the child\n> here in your household.\"\n>\n> Erasmus knew it was a standard parental imperative for her to be\n> worried about her offspring, and that gave him leverage. \"You have\n> either arrogance\n>\n> or ambition. But I shall consider your request, depending on how much\n> I enjoy our discussions and debates.\"\n>\n> Spotting a fat beetle at the base of a terra cotta planter, Erasmus\n> nudged it with one foot. The insect had a black shell with an\n> intricate red design. His smooth face mask shifted, flowed, until the\n> shaping film displayed an amused expression. Erasmus let the beetle\n> nearly escape, then moved his smooth foot to block it again.\n> Persistent, it scuttled in another direction.\n>\n> \"You and I have a great deal in common, Serena Butler,\" he said.\n> Remotely, he activated a contraband Chusuk music cube, hoping the\n> melody would draw out her internal emotions. \"Each of us has an\n> independent mind. I respect that in you, because it is such an\n> integral part of my own personality.\"\n>\n> Serena resented any such comparison, but held her tongue.\n>\n> Erasmus scooped the beetle onto one hand, but his primary interest\n> dwelled on Serena--- he was intrigued at how humans tried to keep so\n> much of themselves veiled. Perhaps, by applying various pressures, he\n> could see through to her inner core.\n>\n> With the music playing in the background, Erasmus continued, \"Some\n> robots keep their own personalities rather than simply uploading a\n> portion of the evermind. I began as a thinking machine on Corrin, but\n> I chose not to accept regular Omnius updates that would synchronize me\n> with the evermind.\"\n>\n> Serena saw that the beetle was immobile on his metallic palm. She\n> wondered if he had killed it.\n>\n> \"But a singular event changed me forever,\" Erasmus said, his voice\n> pleasant, as if telling a story about a quaint forest outing. \"I had\n> set out across Corrin's unsettled territories on a private scouting\n> mission. Because I was inquisitive and did not wish to accept the\n> standard analyses compiled by Omnius, I ventured into the landscape on\n> my own. It was rugged, rocky, and wild. I had never seen vegetation\n> except for in the areas where Old\n>\n> Empire terraformers had planted new ecosystems.

Corrin's red-giant sun is in\n> turmoil and unstable, with frequent flare activity, sudden hurricanes\n> of radiation.

I could not move for\n> an entire Corrin year . . . twenty Terran standard years.\n>\n> \"The crevasse's deep shadow shielded me from solar radiation, and soon\n> enough, my mental processors recovered.

During all that time, two decades, I had nothing to do but\n> *contemplate*.\"\n>\n> \"No one to talk to but yourself,\" she said. \"Poor, lonely robot.\"\n>\n> Ignoring the remark, Erasmus said, \"Such an ordeal altered my\n> fundamental nature in ways I could never have foreseen. In fact,\n> Omnius still does not\n>\n> understand me.\"\n>\n> By the time he'd finally been discovered and rescued by other robots,\n> Erasmus had developed an individual personality. After his restoration\n> and reintegration into the cooperative machine society, Omnius had\n> asked Erasmus if he wished to be upgraded with standardized character\n> traits.\n>\n> \"*Upgraded*, he called it,\" Erasmus said with some amusement. \"But I\n> declined the offer. After reaching such . . . enlightenment, I was\n> reluctant to delete my impulses and ideas, my thoughts and memories.\n> It seemed too great a loss to bear. And the Corrin-Omnius soon\n> discovered how much he enjoyed sparring with me verbally.\"\n>\n> Now, peering at the motionless beetle on his artificial hand, Erasmus\n> said matter-of-factly, \"I am a celebrity among the widespread\n> everminds. They look forward to receiving updates containing my\n> actions and assertions, like a serial publication. These are known as\n> the 'Erasmus Dialogues.'\"\n>\n> With a guarded look, she nodded toward the motionless insect. \"And\n> will you include a discussion of that beetle? How can you understand\n> something you have killed?\"\n>\n> \"It is not dead,\" Erasmus assured her. \"I detect a faint but\n> unmistakable throb of life. The creature wants me to believe it is\n> deceased, so that I will discard it. Despite its small size, it has a\n> powerful will to survive.\"\n>\n> Kneeling, he set the beetle on a flagstone with a surprisingly gentle\n> touch, then stepped back. Moments later, the bug stirred and scampered\n> to safety under the planter. \"See? I wish to understand all living\n> things--- including you.\"\n>\n> Serena glowered. The robot had managed to surprise her.\n>\n> \"Omnius does not think I can ever attain his intellectual level,\"\n> Erasmus said. \"But he remains intrigued by my mental agility--- the\n> way my mind continually evolves in new and impulsive directions. Like\n> that beetle, I am capable of springing to life and persevering.\"\n>\n> \"Do you really expect to become more than a machine?\"\n>\n> Taking no offense, Erasmus replied, \"It is a human trait to better\n> oneself, is it not? That is all I am trying to do.\"\n>\n> *One direction is as good as another.*\n>\n> --- saying of the Open Land\n>\n> **B**y the tenth time he rode a giant sandworm, Selim was proficient\n> enough to enjoy the experience. No other thrill could compare to the\n> power of a leviathan of the deep desert. He loved racing across the\n> dunes while perched on the high ridges of a worm, crossing an ocean of\n> sand in a single day.\n>\n> Selim had brought water, rugged clothing, equipment, and food from the\n> abandoned botanical testing station. His crystal sandworm tooth proved\n> a valuable tool as well as a mark of personal pride. Inside the empty\n> station, he had sometimes stared at the smooth milky curve of the\n> blade under the dim light of recharge panels and imagined a religious\n> significance to the object. It was a relic of his supreme test out\n> here in this wasteland, and a symbol that Buddallah was watching over\n> him. Perhaps the worms were part of his destiny.\n>\n> He came to believe that the sandworms were not Shaitan after all, but\n> blessings from Buddallah himself, perhaps even tangible manifestations\n> of God.\n>\n> After months of recuperation and boredom inside the old research\n> facility, living without purpose, Selim had known he must go out and\n> ride a sandworm again. He needed to learn exactly what it was that\n> Buddallah expected of him.\n>\n> He had carefully marked the location of the testing station.\n> Unfortunately, since he couldn't guide the sandworms, he knew it would\n> be a challenge to make his way back to the secret place. Upon\n> departing, he had carried everything necessary on his back.\n>\n> He was Selim Wormrider, chosen and guided by Buddallah. He needed no\n> help from others.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AFTER KILLING TWO more sandworms by riding them until they collapsed\n> of exhaustion, Selim discovered that it was not necessary to slay a\n> worm just so he could get safely away. It was possible, though risky,\n> to dismount from a weary beast by running down the length of its back,\n> leaping away from the hot tail, and then racing toward nearby rocks.\n> The depleted worm, too tired to give chase, would wallow in deep dust,\n> and sulk.\n>\n> This satisfied Selim, because it seemed wrong to destroy the creatures\n> that gave him transportation. If the sandworms were emissaries from\n> Buddallah, and old men of the desert, then he must treat them with\n> respect.\n>\n> On his fourth ride, he discovered how to manipulate the sensitive\n> edges of worm rings, using a shovel-bladed tool and the sharp metal\n> spear to prod Shaitan in the direction Selim wished to go. It was a\n> simple concept, but one that required a great deal of work. His\n> muscles ached by the time he dropped away from a spent worm and ran to\n> the shelter of nearby rocks. He remained lost out in the deep desert .\n> . . but in a very real sense, the desert belonged to him now. He was\n> invincible! Buddallah would care for him.\n>\n> Selim still had an adequate supply of water from the distilling units\n> in the testing station, and his diet consisted of large amounts of\n> melange, which gave him strength and energy. As soon as he learned how\n> to master the worms, he was able to travel wherever he chose, working\n> his way back toward the abandoned station.\n>\n> Other Zensunnis would have called him mad, appalled at his foolhardy\n> attempt to tame the terrifying sandworms. But the young exile no\n> longer cared a whit how people felt about him. He was in touch with\n> another realm. He felt in his heart that this was what he had been\n> born todo. . . .\n>\n> Now under the double moonlight, Selim guided his worm as it hissed\n> across the sands. Hours ago, the creature had ceased trying to throw\n> him off, and instead plunged onward, resigned to the commands of the\n> imp who kept inflicting pain in the sensitive flesh between ring\n> segments. Selim navigated\n>\n> by the stars, drawing lines like arrows between constellations. The\n> unforgiving landscape began to look familiar, and he believed he was\n> at last close to the botanical testing station, his sanctuary. Back\n> home.\n>\n> All alone atop the sandworm, surrounded by the bitter aromas of\n> brimstone and cinnamon, he allowed himself to think and dream. He'd\n> had little else to do since his exile. Was that not how great\n> philosophers were born?\n>\n> Someday perhaps, he would use the abandoned facility as the seed of\n> his own colony. Maybe he could gather disaffected people from other\n> Zensunni villages, outcasts like himself who wanted to live without\n> oppressive strictures enforced by inflexible naibs. By controlling the\n> great worms, Selim's people would have a strength that no outlaws had\n> ever possessed.\n>\n> Was that what Buddallah wanted him to do?\n>\n> The young man smiled at his daydream, then grew sad as he recalled\n> Ebrahim, who had so easily turned against him. As if that was not\n> enough, he had then joined others in hurling insults and stones at\n> Selim.\n>\n> As his sandworm crashed over the dunes, the young rider finally saw\n> the line of rocks ahead, familiar crags and dark formations. His heart\n> leaped with joy. The behemoth had carried him home faster than\n> anticipated. He grinned, then realized it would be a challenge to\n> dismount from the feisty demon, which was not yet exhausted. Another\n> test?\n>\n> Using his spear and the shovel-spreader, Selim drove the worm toward\n> the rocks, thinking he might beach the creature on the outcroppings,\n> where it would thrash and wriggle its way back to the soft sanctuary\n> of sand. The eyeless monster sensed the rocks, recognizing a\n> difference in viscosity and vibrations within the sand, and swerved in\n> the opposite direction.\n>\n> Selim pulled harder on the shovel and jabbed with the spear. The\n> confused worm twitched and slowed. As it curled close to the nearest\n> line of rock, Selim yanked himself and his equipment free. He tumbled\n> down the creature's ring segments until he dropped to the sand and\n> then ran away at full speed.\n>\n> The safe reef of rock was less than a hundred meters distant, and the\n> worm thrashed about as if it couldn't believe it had been so\n> unexpectedly released. Finally, it sensed the rhythm of Selim's racing\n> footsteps. The monster turned and lunged toward him.\n>\n> Selim ran faster, bolting toward the boulders. He sprang onto a shelf\n> of sharp lava rock and kept running, spitting pebbles from beneath the\n> soles of his boots.\n>\n> The worm exploded out of the sand, its head questing, its cavernous\n> maw open. It hesitated as if afraid to go closer to the rock barrier,\n> then slammed downward.\n>\n> Selim had already scrambled up and over the second line of boulders,\n> diving between rough-edged stones into a pocket, less than a cave but\n> enough for him to wedge his body into. The sandworm crashed like a\n> gigantic hammer into the ridge, but it did not know where the little\n> human had gone to ground.\n>\n> Enraged, the worm pulled back, its gaping mouth exuding an\n> overpowering stench of melange. It smashed its big head against the\n> rocks again, then retreated. Frustrated and beaten, it finally dragged\n> itself away, wallowed through the sands, and then sank below the dune\n> crests. Slow and indignant, it headed back out to the deep desert.\n>\n> His heart pounding, adrenaline charging his bloodstream, Selim crawled\n> out of the shelter. He looked around, amazed that he had made it back\n> alive. Laughing, he praised Buddallah at the top of his lungs. The old\n> botanical testing station was above him on the ridge, waiting for him.\n> He would spend several days there, replenishing his supplies and\n> drinking plenty of water.\n>\n> As he began to climb with weary arms and legs, Selim saw something\n> glint in the moonlight, lost in the broken rocks against which the\n> furious worm had smashed itself. Another crystalline tooth, a longer\n> one. It had broken free during the demon's attack and now lay in a\n> cranny. Selim reached down and plucked out the curved, milky weapon. A\n> reward from\n>\n> Buddallah! He held it high triumphantly before turning to make his way\n> up to the derelict station.\n>\n> Now he had two of them.\n>\n> *Time depends on the position of the observer and the direction in\n> which he looks.*\n>\n> --- COGITOR KWYNA,\n\nCity of Introspection archives\n\n> **S**till angry, Zufa Cenva returned to Rossak, where she intended to\n> focus on the escalating war.

After a thousand years, any\n> prospect of change or improvement seemed impossible.\n>\n> Now, after much consideration, Iblis was willing to believe that there\n> *might* be rebellious cells among humans on Earth, possibly even on\n> other Synchronized Worlds. Widespread groups who intended to fight\n> back.\n>\n> *If we can build such enormous monuments, do we not also have the\n> power to tear them down?*\n>\n> The thought ignited his long-simmering resentment toward Omnius, the\n> robots, and especially the cymeks, who seemed to bear a grudge against\n> humans. But before he decided if the intriguing message was more than\n> just fantasy, he needed to do some research. Iblis had survived so\n> well and so long because he was cautious and obedient. Now he had to\n> conduct his investigations in such a manner that the machines would\n> never suspect his intent.\n>\n> For answers, he could think of no better source than the Cogitor Eklo.\n>\n> Years ago Iblis had been a member of an armed slave-pursuit team,\n> chasing a few deluded people who had senselessly escaped from the city\n> grid and fled into the hills with no plans, survival skills, or\n> supplies. Wild rumors had convinced the gullible escapees that they\n> could demand sanctuary from the politically neutral Cogitors. A\n> foolish notion, considering that the meditative and detached human\n> brains wanted nothing more than to isolate themselves and contemplate\n> their esoteric thoughts. The Cogitors had not cared about the Time of\n> Titans, the Hrethgir Rebellions, or Omnius's creation of the\n> Synchronized Worlds. Cogitors did not wish to be disturbed, so the\n> thinking machines tolerated them.\n>\n> When Iblis and his pursuit team had surrounded the isolated monastery\n> on the rugged mountainside, Eklo had dispatched his human secondaries\n> to drive the slaves out of concealment. The escapees had cursed and\n> threatened the Cogitor, but Eklo passively ignored them. Iblis and his\n> armed companions had then brought the slaves in for \"vigorous\n> reassignment,\" after tossing their ringleader off a high cliff. . . .\n>\n> Now the sturdy burrhorse ascended the steep path that shifted and\n> crumbled beneath its hooves. Presently Iblis made out the high tower\n> of the monastery, an impressive stone structure partly shrouded in\n> mists. Its windows glowed red and then shifted to a sky blue,\n> reportedly according to the moods of the great contemplative mind.\n>\n> In his schooling as a trustee, Iblis had learned about the Cogitors,\n> about the primitive remnants of religion still manifested by some of\n> the larger groups of human slaves. Omnius had ceased trying to quash\n> it, though the evermind did not understand the superstitions and\n> rituals.\n>\n> Long before the takeover of the Old Empire, Eklo had left his physical\n> body behind and devoted his mind to analysis and introspection. While\n> planning the large-scale overthrow of humanity, the Titan Juno had\n> adopted Eklo as her personal advisor, demanding answers. Uninterested\n> in repercussions, taking no sides in the conflict, Eklo had answered\n> Juno's questions, and his unwitting advice had helped the Titans plan\n> their conquest. In the thousand years since, Eklo had remained on\n> Earth. The driving passion in his long life was to synthesize a\n> complete understanding of the universe.\n>\n> Reaching the end of the trail at the base of the stone tower, Iblis\n> suddenly found himself surrounded by a dozen robed men armed with\n> archaic pikes and barbed clubs. Their robes were dark brown, and they\n> wore white clerical collars. One of the secondaries grabbed the reins\n> of Iblis's burrhorse. \"Leave here. We offer no sanctuary.\"\n>\n> \"I do not seek it.\" Iblis gazed down at the men. \"I have only come to\n> ask the Cogitor a question.\" He dismounted and, after charming them\n> with his warmth and sincerity, glided confidently toward the high\n> tower, leaving the robed men to hold his burrhorse.\n>\n> \"Cogitor Eklo is deep in thought and does not wish to be disturbed,\"\n> one of the secondaries called out.\n>\n> Iblis chuckled lightly, his voice smooth. \"The Cogitor has been\n> thinking for a thousand years. He can spare a few minutes to hear me\n> out. I am a\n>\n> respected trustee. And if I give him information he doesn't already\n> know, he'll have something more to ponder for the next century or so.\"\n>\n> Muttering in confusion, several secondaries followed Iblis up wide\n> steps. Abruptly, however, as he reached the arched entry, a\n> broad-shouldered monk blocked his way. The muscles on his thick arms\n> and chest had gone to fat, and he peered out from sunken eyesockets\n> with dull eyes.\n>\n> Iblis infused his voice with friendly persuasion. \"I honor the\n> knowledge Cogitor Eklo has acquired. I will not waste his time.\"\n>\n> Frowning skeptically at Iblis, the monk adjusted his clerical collar\n> and said, \"You are bold enough, and the Cogitor is curious to hear\n> your question.\" After checking the visitor's body for weapons, he\n> said, \"I am Aquim. Come this way.\"\n>\n> The big man led Iblis along a narrow stone corridor and up a steep\n> spiral stairway. As they proceeded, Iblis said, \"I have been here\n> before, chasing escaped slaves---\"\n>\n> \"Eklo remembers,\" Aquim interrupted.\n>\n> They reached the highest point in the structure, a round room at the\n> pinnacle of the tower. The Cogitor's plexiplaz container rested on an\n> altarlike ledge beneath one of the windows. Winds hummed along the\n> window edges and swirled the mists. The windows shimmered sky blue\n> from some internal illumination.\n>\n> Leaving the other secondaries behind, Aquim stepped up to the\n> transparent brain canister and stood for a moment, looking down at it\n> reverently. He jabbed a hand into one of his pockets, and his\n> trembling fingers emerged with a twisted strip of paper encrusted with\n> a black powder. He placed the strip in his mouth, letting it dissolve.\n> His eyes rolled upward, as if in ecstasy.\n>\n> \"Semuta,\" he said to Iblis, \"derived from the burned residue of elacca\n> wood, smuggled here. It aids me in what I must do.\" With complete\n>\n> serenity, he rested both hands against the smooth lip of the canister,\n> and said, \"I understand nothing.\"\n>\n> The naked brain inside its blue soup of electrafluid seemed to pulse,\n> waiting.\n>\n> With a beatific smile, the big monk drew a deep breath and slid his\n> fingers into the open mouth of the tank, dipping into the thick\n> life-support liquid. The gelatinous medium wet his skin, penetrated\n> his pores, linked with his nerve endings. Aquim's expression changed,\n> and he said, \"Eklo wishes to know why you did not ask your question\n> the last time you were here.\"\n>\n> Iblis did not know if he should speak to the secondary or directly to\n> the Cogitor, so he directed his reply to a space between them. \"At the\n> time, I did not understand what was significant. Now there is\n> something I wish to know from you. No one else can provide an\n> objective answer.\"\n>\n> \"No judgment or opinion is ever completely objective.\" The big monk\n> spoke with calm conviction. \"There are no absolutes.\"\n>\n> \"You are less biased than anyone else I could ask.\"\n>\n> The altar ledge moved around slowly along a hidden track, and the\n> Cogitor came to rest in front of a different window, with Aquim\n> keeping pace, his hand still immersed in the canister. \"State your\n> question.\"\n>\n> \"I have always worked loyally for my cymek and machine masters,\" Iblis\n> began, selecting his words carefully. \"Lately I received word that\n> there may be human resistance groups on Earth. I wish to know if this\n> report is credible. Are there people who want to overthrow their\n> rulers and gain freedom?\"\n>\n> During a moment's hesitation, the secondary stared blankly into space,\n> either from the effects of the semuta or from his connection with the\n> philosopher brain. Iblis hoped the Cogitor would not drift into a long\n> period of contemplation. Finally, in a deep and sonorous voice, Aquim\n> said, \"Nothing is impossible.\"\n>\n> Iblis tried several variations of the question, deftly circling with\n> phrases, adjusting his selection of words. He did not want to reveal\n> his intentions, though the neutral Cogitor presumably did not care why\n> Iblis might want to find the rebels, whether to destroy them or to\n> join them. Each time, however, Iblis received the same enigmatic\n> answer.\n>\n> Summoning his courage, he finally asked, \"If such a widespread, secret\n> resistance organization *did* exist, would it have a chance of\n> succeeding? Could the reign of the thinking machines possibly come to\n> an end?\"\n>\n> This time the Cogitor pondered longer, as if assessing different\n> factors in the question. When the same answer came via the robed monk,\n> the words, spoken more ominously, seemed to convey a deeper meaning.\n> \"Nothing is impossible.\"\n>\n> After that, Aquim withdrew his dripping hand from Eklo's brain\n> container, signifying that the audience was concluded. Iblis bowed\n> politely, expressed his gratitude, and departed, his own thoughts in\n> turmoil.\n>\n> On the ride back down the steep trail, the frightened but exhilarated\n> crew supervisor decided that if he could not locate one of the\n> resistance group members, he had another option.\n>\n> Drawing from his deeply loyal work crews, Iblis would form a rebel\n> cell of his own.\n>\n> *Conflict prolonged over an extended period tends to be\n> self-perpetuating and can easily plunge out of control.*\n>\n> --- TLALOC,\n>\n> *A Time for Titans*\n>\n> **\"A**fter a thousand years, only five of us remain.\"\n>\n> It was rare for the surviving Titans to congregate, especially on\n> Earth where the eyes of Omnius watched them every moment.

Our organic brains cannot.\"\n>\n> Ajax was so infuriated by the dilemma of the Sorceresses that his\n> life-support monitors had trouble maintaining the proper chemical\n> balance inside his shimmering electrafluid. He could not find words to\n> express his anger.\n>\n> \"But didn't this Sorceress have to kill herself to slay Barbarossa and\n> a handful of neo-cymeks?\" Xerxes asked. \"It was *suicide*. Do you\n> think they'd be willing to do that again?\"\n>\n> \"Just because you're a coward, Xerxes, doesn't mean the feral humans\n> are so afraid to sacrifice themselves,\" Agamemnon said. \"That one\n> Sorceress cost us seven neo-cymeks and a Titan. A staggering loss.\"\n>\n> After living a thousand years, during which billions upon billions of\n> human lives were lost (many at Agamemnon's own hands or while he\n> watched), he had thought he was immune to witnessing death. Of the\n> original Titans, Barbarossa, Juno, and Tlaloc had been his closest\n> friends. The four of them had been the seeds of the rebellion. The\n> other Titans had come later, adding to the junta as necessary.\n>\n> Despite the fact that his mental images were very old, the Titan\n> general still remembered Barbarossa in his human form. Vilhelm Jayther\n> had been a man with thin arms and legs, wide shoulders, and a sunken\n> chest. Not pleasing to look upon, some said, but his eyes had the\n> sharpest intensity Agamemnon had ever seen. And his programming genius\n> was unparalleled.\n>\n> With a wolfish obsession, Jayther had accepted the challenge of\n> overthrowing the Old Empire, losing sleep for weeks until he figured\n> out how to solve the problem. Jayther gave himself over entirely to\n> the task\n>\n> until he understood precisely how to manipulate sophisticated\n> programming for the rebels' purposes. Implanting humanlike ambitions\n> and goals into the computer network, he had made the machines *want*\n> to participate in the takeover.\n>\n> Later, though, Omnius had developed ambitions of his own.\n>\n> A man of tremendous foresight, Jayther had included fail-safe\n> instructions that precluded the thinking machines from harming any of\n> the Titans. Agamemnon and all of his compatriots were alive only\n> because of Vilhelm Jayther--- Barbarossa.\n>\n> Now the Sorceresses had killed him. The realization kept pounding\n> inside Agamemnon's brain, building his anger.\n>\n> \"We cannot let this outrage go unpunished,\" Ajax said. \"I say we go to\n> Rossak, slay all the women, and turn their world into a charred ball.\"\n>\n> \"Dear Ajax,\" Juno said sweetly, \"need I remind you that just *one* of\n> those Sorceresses destroyed Barbarossa and all the neo-cymeks with\n> him?\"\n>\n> \"So?\" Ajax's voice swelled with pride. \"Single-handedly, I\n> exterminated the human infestation on Walgis. Together, we can handle\n> a few Sorceresses.\"\n>\n> In a sharp tone Agamemnon said, \"The rebels on Walgis were already\n> broken before you started slaughtering them, Ajax. These Sorceresses\n> are different.\"\n>\n> Dante said, in a droning voice, \"Omnius will never authorize a\n> full-scale strike. The expenditure in resources would be too great. I\n> have completed a preliminary analysis.\"\n>\n> \"Nevertheless,\" Agamemnon said, \"it would be an extreme tactical\n> mistake to allow this defeat to go unchallenged.\"\n>\n> After a few moments of uneasy silence, Xerxes said, \"Since so few of\n> us remain, the Titans should never, never attack together. Think of\n> the risk.\"\n>\n> \"But if we go together to Rossak and crush the Sorceresses, then the\n> threat will be over,\" Ajax said.\n>\n> Juno made a hissing sound, then said, \"I see your brain there in the\n> jar, Ajax, but you don't seem to be using it. Perhaps you should\n> change your electrafluid? The Sorceresses have proven they can destroy\n> us, and you want to go blundering into the greatest threat the cymeks\n> have ever faced, like sheep baring our throats for slaughter?\"\n>\n> \"We could bring enough robot ships to attack from orbit,\" Dante said.\n> \"We need not risk ourselves.\"\n>\n> \"This is personal,\" Ajax growled. \"One of the Titans has been\n> assassinated. We don't just toss missiles from the other side of the\n> planetary system. That is the coward's way . . . even if the thinking\n> machines call it *efficient*.\"\n>\n> \"There is room for compromise,\" Agamemnon said. \"Juno, Xerxes, and I\n> can gather neo-cymeks as volunteers and go in with a robot fleet. That\n> should be enough to inflict immense damage on Rossak.\"\n>\n> \"But I can't go, Agamemnon,\" Xerxes said. \"I am working here with\n> Dante. Our greatest monuments in the Forum Plaza are nearly completed.\n> We've just begun work on a new statue to Barbarossa.\"\n>\n> \"Good timing,\" Juno said. \"I'm sure he appreciates it, now that he's\n> dead.\"\n>\n> \"Xerxes is right,\" Dante said. \"There is also the immense frieze of\n> the Victory of the Titans being laid out and constructed on the\n> hillside near the center of the metropolitan grid. We have work crew\n> supervisors, but they require constant surveillance. Otherwise\n> expenditures will grow too great, and schedules will not be met---\"\n>\n> \"Given the recent debacle with his own statue, Ajax is perfectly\n> familiar with such problems,\" Juno said. \"Why not let him stay behind,\n> instead of Xerxes?\"\n>\n> Ajax roared, \"I will not remain here while others get the glory!\"\n>\n> But Agamemnon said, \"Xerxes, you will come with us. Ajax, remain here\n> to monitor the construction with Dante. Do it for the memory of\n> Barbarossa.\"\n>\n> Both Xerxes and Ajax railed on, but Agamemnon was their leader, and he\n> imposed the control over them that he had exerted for centuries. From\n> her tank, the once-lovely Juno said, \"Can you convince Omnius to allow\n> this, my love?\"\n>\n> \"The *hrethgir* on Giedi Prime not only killed our friend, but also\n> obliterated the new Omnius incarnation before it could be updated. A\n> long time ago, when Barbarossa altered the network's original\n> programming, he put something of himself into the computer mind,\n> enough for it to understand the nature of conquest. I'm betting he\n> will feel our need for *revenge* as well.\"\n>\n> The Titans considered this comment in silence, then Agamemnon said,\n> \"We will go to Rossak and leave it in flames.\"\n>\n> *In warfare there are countless factors that cannot be predicted, and\n> which do not depend upon the quality of military command.

Xavier Harkonnen knew military\n> tactics and strategies, had planned to devote his life to service in\n> the Salusan Militia and the League Armada. But now he had no choice\n> but to speak before the gathered League representatives in the Hall of\n> Parliament.\n>\n> After the bittersweet victory on Giedi Prime, some things needed to be\n> said.\n>\n> The old Parliament building had been shored up and repaired, while the\n> remnants of scaffolding and temporary walls marked where\n> reconstruction had not yet been completed. Plazstone, pillars, and\n> mural walls were still marked with cracks and obvious patchwork.\n> Battle scars, badges of honor.\n>\n> Shortly before the young officer's scheduled address, Viceroy Butler\n> had stood beside his stoic wife on the floor of Parliament as they\n> participated in a memorial service for Serena and the fallen comrades\n> in her Giedi Prime rescue mission.\n>\n> \"She died doing exactly what she demanded of herself, and of us,\" the\n> Viceroy said. \"A light has gone out in our lives.\"\n>\n> In the year since the cymek attack on Salusa, the people had endured\n> many funerals and too much grief. But Serena, the fiery young\n> representative, had always insisted that the League serve the people\n> and help those in need.\n>\n> Beside the Viceroy, Livia Butler wore her contemplation robes from the\n> City of Introspection. She had already watched her only son Fredo\n> waste away from his blood disease; now her eldest daughter had been\n> killed by\n>\n> the thinking machines. She had only ethereal young Octa left of her\n> children.\n>\n> Representatives of the League Worlds remained silent and respectful,\n> sharing in the sadness. Despite her youth, Serena Butler had made a\n> lasting impression with her idealism and exuberance. After the formal\n> eulogy many speakers took turns at the podium to praise her acts of\n> generosity.\n>\n> Xavier listened to the tributes. The representatives looked at him\n> compassionately. He thought of the life he and Serena had meant to\n> share.\n>\n> For her sake, though, Xavier had not, and would not, shed tears\n> openly. If the human race wept for all those who had fallen, they\n> would be paralyzed in an unending state of grief. His lips trembled,\n> and his vision blurred, but he forced himself to be strong. It was his\n> duty. Although his heart grieved, Xavier's mind turned to furious\n> thoughts of the enemy, and of traitorous human sympathizers who fought\n> beside the robots.\n>\n> His memory of Serena would be his constant source of strength and\n> inspiration. Even in death, she would drive him to achievements that\n> he never could have attained without her.

Lovely Serena would watch over him\n> always--- as she did now, when he was about to rally the resources and\n> military might of the angry masses.\n>\n> Shaken and grim, Xavier stepped into the projection dome, followed by\n> a sallow-skinned Viceroy Butler. Both men wore silver-and-blue robes\n> and capes, with black headbands in honor of their fallen loved one.\n>\n> It was time for the continuing business of humanity.\n>\n> After his recent military success, he needed little introduction. \"We\n> are human beings, and have always fought for our rights and our\n> dignity. We formed the League of Nobles so that free men could resist\n> the Titans, and after them the thinking machines. Only by standing\n> united have we been able to stop the headlong conquests of our\n> enemies.\" He scanned the\n>\n> representatives seated in the crowded hall. \"But at times the League\n> is its own worst enemy.\"\n>\n> The attendees respected this hero too much to argue, and Xavier\n> continued quickly and concisely. \"While we pay lip service to our\n> alliance, the League Worlds remain self-centered and independent. When\n> a beleaguered planet calls for help, the League debates and agonizes\n> for months before we decide on our response--- until it is too late!\n> We saw that on Giedi Prime. Only Serena's folly forced us to act\n> swiftly enough to make a difference. She knew exactly what she was\n> doing, and paid for it with her life.\"\n>\n> When a few of the representatives began to mutter, Xavier's skin grew\n> hot and he silenced them with a booming voice. \"The League of Nobles\n> must form a stronger coalition under streamlined leadership. To be\n> effective against a highly organized computer evermind, we need a\n> closely knit government of humans, better than this loose structure.\"\n> He waved his hands as he spoke.\n>\n> \"As Serena Butler advocated, we must make every effort to secure the\n> cooperation of the Unallied Planets, thus strengthening our defensive\n> framework and adding a buffer zone to our protected territory.\"\n>\n> Viceroy Butler stepped close beside him and added in a voice cracking\n> with emotion, \"That was always my daughter's dream. Now we must make\n> it ours.\"\n>\n> Several uncertain nobles rose in respectful dissent. A lean,\n> hard-looking woman from Kirana III said, \"Bringing so many worlds\n> together under tight rule, especially in a military guise, reminds me\n> of the Time of Titans.\"\n>\n> A small-statured nobleman from Hagal shouted, \"No more empires!\"\n>\n> Xavier raised his own voice. \"Isn't an empire better than\n> *extinction*? While you worry about political nuances, Omnius is\n> conquering star systems!\"\n>\n> But another said, \"For centuries the League of Nobles and Synchronized\n> Worlds have held each other at bay, in an uneasy equilibrium. Omnius\n> has\n>\n> never pressed beyond the boundaries of the Old Empire. We always\n> assumed the thinking machines didn't consider it efficient or\n> worthwhile. Why should that change now?\"\n>\n> \"For whatever reason, it *has* changed! The thinking machines seem\n> intent on genocide.\" Xavier clenched his fists; he had not expected to\n> argue over this, when the evidence was so obvious. \"Must we cower\n> behind our paper-thin defense and simply *react* whenever Omnius\n> chooses to test us? As we did here on Salusa a year ago, as we did on\n> Giedi Prime?\"\n>\n> In a dramatic outburst, he hefted the podium and sent it crashing\n> through one side of the dome enclosure. The front row of nobles\n> scrambled away from the shower of broken prismatic glass. Shocked\n> representatives yelled that Xavier's behavior was uncalled-for; others\n> summoned security guards to remove the distraught officer from the\n> hall.\n>\n> Stepping through the broken enclosure, Xavier shouted without the\n> benefit of a voice amplifier, \"Good! That's the kind of spirit I want\n> to see! The League has been cringing for too long. I have spoken with\n> other Armada commanders, and most of us agree: We need to change our\n> tactics and surprise the machines.

One day, I believe we must go on the\n> *offensive*! It is the only way we can win this conflict.\"\n>\n> Gradually, the assemblage understood that Xavier had intentionally\n> provoked a reaction. With a polished boot, he kicked broken debris off\n> the stage. \"Experience is our best teacher. The machines could attack\n> Salusa again at any moment, or Poritrin, or Rossak, or Hagal, Ginaz,\n> Kirana III, Seneca, Vertree Colony, Relicon--- need I go on?

Can we develop the weapons\n> to succeed? The time for complacency is past.\"\n>\n> In the ensuing discussion, Zufa Cenva offered more telepathy raids\n> against cymeks.

Lord Niko Bludd bragged of the continuing work\n> of Tio Holtzman, who planned to test a new \"alloy resonator\" soon.\n> Other League representatives offered suggestions, targets, ways to\n> strengthen their position.\n>\n> Relieved and inspired, Xavier gazed around the assemblage. He had\n> shamed them into a show of boisterous support, and the voices of\n> dissent--- for now--- remained subdued.\n>\n> Unbidden tears ran down his face, and he tasted salt on his lips.\n> Drained of emotion and energy, he noticed Viceroy Butler looking\n> proudly at him, as if the young man were his son.\n>\n> *I am assuming the mantle of Serena*, Xavier realized, *doing what she\n> would have done.*\n>\n> *As if to balance the pain and suffering, War has also been the\n> breeding ground for some of our greatest dreams and accomplishments.*\n\n--- HOLTZMAN,\n\nacceptance speech, Poritrin Medal of Valor\n\n> **B**lindly confident, Tio Holtzman plunged ahead with his new idea,\n> making Norma Cenva feel like chaff in a gusting wind. With his\n> alloy-resonance generator, the inventor insisted on proving himself to\n> her.\n>\n> Though she remained doubtful that his concept would work, Norma could\n> not demonstrate her reason for uncertainty with straightforward\n> mathematical proofs. Instinct spoke to her like a nagging voice, but\n> she kept her worries to herself. After Holtzman's sour reaction to her\n> initial reservations, he had not asked for her opinion again.\n>\n> Norma hoped that she was mistaken. She was *human*, after all, and far\n> from perfect.\n\nWhile the Savant busied himself inside the domed demonstration\nlaboratory\n\n> --- a theater-sized structure atop an adjoining bluff--- Norma kept to\n> the sidelines. Even her most innocent participation made him nervous,\n> as if he put more stock in her doubts than he admitted aloud.\n>\n> Now she stood on the span of the bridge between bluff sections and\n> reached up to grab the rail. Listening to breezes hum through the\n> cables, she peered through safety netting at the river traffic far\n> below.\n>\n> She heard Holtzman inside the domed demo-lab, shouting to slaves as\n> they erected a bulky generator that produced a resonating field\n> intended to shake apart and melt a metal form. An imperious presence\n> in a white-and-purple robe, he wore chains of office about his neck,\n> baubles that signified his scientific awards and achievements.\n> Holtzman glared at his workers, then paced around, double-checking,\n> watching every detail.\n>\n> Lord Bludd and a handful of Poritrin nobles would join them to watch\n> the day's test, so Norma understood Holtzman's anxiety. She herself\n> would never have made such an extravagant presentation of an untried\n> device, but the scientist did not show even a glimmer of doubt.\n>\n> \"Norma, please assist me in here,\" Holtzman called in an exasperated\n> tone. On short legs she ran from the bridge into the enclosure. He\n> gestured disgustedly toward the slaves. \"They don't understand a thing\n> I've told them to do. Supervise them, so I can test the calibration.\"\n>\n> At the center of the reinforced chamber, Holtzman's crew had erected a\n> metal mannequin that had the vague features of a combat robot. Norma\n> had never seen a real thinking machine, but had scrutinized many\n> stored images. She stared at the mockup. This was the enemy, the true\n> foe against which all of her work must be directed.\n>\n> She looked at her mentor with more compassion, understanding his\n> desperation. Holtzman was morally obligated to pursue *any* idea, to\n> find *any* way to continue this noble fight. He had a good feel for\n> projected energies, distortion fields, and nonprojectile weaponry. She\n> hoped his alloy-resonance generator would work after all.\n>\n> Before the slaves had finished rigging the test apparatus, a commotion\n> occurred outside the main house. Ribbon-festooned ceremonial barges\n> came into view above the cliffs, where Holtzman's balconies overlooked\n> the river. Scale-armored Dragoon guards stood on the flying craft with\n> Lord Bludd, along with five senators and a black-robed court\n> historian.\n>\n> Holtzman dropped what he was doing. \"Norma, finish this. Please!\"\n> Without looking back at her, he rushed across the connecting bridge to\n> greet his prestigious visitors.\n>\n> Norma urged the slaves to hurry, as she personally adjusted the\n> calibrations and attuned the apparatus to the inventor's\n> specifications. Light shone through high skylights to illuminate the\n> robot facsimile. Reinforced metal ceiling beams crisscrossed the\n> overhead vault, supporting pulleys and\n>\n> winches that had been used to haul the blockish resonance generator\n> into place.\n>\n> Moody Zenshiite slaves milled about, wearing traditional clothing,\n> red-and-white stripes wrapped around serviceable gray jumpsuits. Many\n> slave owners didn't allow their captives to show signs of\n> individuality, but Holtzman didn't care one way or the other. He only\n> wanted the captive people to perform their tasks without complaint.\n>\n> As they completed their work the slaves backed close to the plated\n> wall, their dark gazes averted. One black-bearded, shadowy-eyed man\n> spoke to them in a language unfamiliar to Norma. Moments later a\n> grinning Holtzman ushered his impressive guests into the demonstration\n> area.\n>\n> The Savant made a grand entrance. At his side, Niko Bludd wore a\n> billowing azure tunic and a scarlet doublet fastened across his barrel\n> chest. His reddish beard had been curled in neat ringlets. Small\n> tattooed circles looked like bubbles at the far points of each eyelid.\n>\n> Walking past the slaves, Bludd noticed Norma and gave the diminutive\n> woman a smile that was both condescending and paternal. Norma bent in\n> a formal bow and politely grasped his slick, lotioned hand.\n>\n> \"We know your time is valuable, Lord Bludd. Therefore, everything has\n> been prepared.\" Holtzman folded his hands. \"This new device has never\n> been tested, and in today's presentation you will be the first to\n> witness its potential.\"\n>\n> Bludd's voice was deep, but musical. \"We always expect the best from\n> you, Tio. If thinking machines have nightmares, no doubt you are in\n> them.\"\n>\n> The entourage chuckled, and Holtzman did his best to blush. He turned\n> toward the slaves and began issuing orders. A half dozen workers held\n> data-recording devices, positioned at important points around the\n> robot mockup.\n>\n> Plush chairs from the main residence had been arranged as seats of\n> honor. Holtzman sat beside Lord Bludd, and Norma was forced to stand\n> by the\n>\n> door. Her mentor appeared confident and intense, but she knew how\n> worried he really was. A failure today might dim his glory in the eyes\n> of the politically powerful nobles on Poritrin.\n>\n> The esteemed observers sat in their cumbersome chairs. Holtzman stared\n> at the generator setup, glancing around as if offering a quiet prayer.\n> He smiled reassuringly at Norma, then ordered the activation of the\n> prototype.\n>\n> A slave flipped a switch, as he had been taught to do. The bulky\n> generator began to hum, directing its invisible beam toward the robot\n> construction.\n>\n> \"If put to practical use,\" Holtzman said with the faintest of quavers,\n> \"we will find ways to make the generator more compact, more easily\n> installed on small ships.\"\n>\n> \"Or we can just build bigger ships,\" Bludd said, with a deep chortle.\n>\n> The hum grew louder, a vibrating rattle that made Norma's teeth\n> chatter.\n>\n> She noticed a thin sheen of perspiration on Holtzman's brow.\n>\n> \"Look, you can see it already.\" The scientist pointed. The targeted\n> robot began to shake, its metal limbs jostling and torso vibrating.\n> \"The effect will continue to build.\"\n>\n> Bludd was delighted. \"That robot is regretting he ever turned against\n> the human race, isn't he!\"\n>\n> The facsimile robot began to shimmer cherry red, its metal heating up\n> as the alloys were attuned to the destructive field projected upon it.\n> Glowing brighter, it shifted to yellow mixed with patches of blinding\n> white.\n>\n> \"By now, a real robot would have been destroyed internally,\" Holtzman\n> said, finally looking content.\n>\n> Abruptly the laboratory's heavy ceiling girders started to rattle, a\n> secondary resonance fed from the targeted robot into the dome's\n> structural framework.\n>\n> The thick walls rumbled and shuddered. A high-pitched hum shrieked\n> through the structure.\n>\n> Norma cried, \"The resonance field is bleeding over.\"\n>\n> Ceiling girders clenched like angry snakes. A crack opened in the\n> dome.\n>\n> \"Shut it off!\" Holtzman shouted, but the terrified slaves scrambled to\n> a corner of the room, as far from the generator as they could get.\n>\n> The robot mockup undulated and twisted, its body core melting. Support\n> struts that held it inside the targeting zone buckled. The\n> ominous-looking combat machine lurched forward then abruptly fell and\n> shattered into blackened metal.\n>\n> Holtzman grabbed Niko Bludd's sleeve. \"My Lord, please hurry across\n> the bridge to my main quarters. We seem to have a . . . slight\n> problem.\"\n>\n> The other nobles were already pelting across the high-tension bridge.\n> Norma was swept along with them. She took one look behind her and saw\n> that the Zenshiite slaves were uncertain what to do. Tio Holtzman gave\n> them no guidance as he retreated over the walkway right behind Bludd.\n>\n> From safety, Norma watched six panicked slaves stumble onto the\n> bridge. Remaining behind, the dark-haired leader pushed them forward,\n> shouting in their odd language. The walkway began to whip up and down\n> as resonance from the projector coupled to the bridge's connecting\n> metal.\n>\n> The bearded Zenshiite leader howled at them again. Norma wished she\n> could rescue those unfortunate, confused people. Couldn't the Dragoon\n> guards do anything? Holtzman remained speechless on this side of the\n> bluff, paralyzed with shock.\n>\n> Before the first batch of slaves could cross, the suspension walkway\n> snapped in the middle, dropping open in a screeching groan of agonized\n> metal. The hapless victims plummeted two hundred meters to the base of\n> the bluff and into the river.\n>\n> Standing on the threshold, separated now by the gulf between the\n> cliffs, the black-bearded leader cursed again. Behind him, a section\n> of the vaulted roof crashed down, destroying the prototype generator\n> and finally stopping the relentless pulse.\n>\n> Dust settled. A few flames and a curl of smoke rose into the air\n> amidst the wailing of injured men still trapped within the collapsed\n> building.\n>\n> Norma felt sick. Beside her, Holtzman sweated profusely and lookedill.\n> He blinked again and again, then wiped his forehead. His skin was\n> gray.\n>\n> In a wry voice, Bludd said, \"Not one of your most successful efforts,\n> Tio.\"\n>\n> \"But you must admit, the concept shows promise, Lord Bludd. Look at\n> the destructive potential,\" Holtzman said, looking at the unruffled\n> nobles without even considering the dead and injured slaves. \"We can\n> be thankful at least that no one was hurt.\"\n\n*Science: The creation of dilemmas by the solution of mysteries.*\n\n--- NORMA CENVA,\n\nunpublished laboratory notebooks\n\n> **I**nside the broken demonstration dome, the bloodstains washed away\n> easily, but deeper scars remained. While a crew of new slaves cleared\n> the rubble, Tio Holtzman crossed a temporary and none-too-sturdy\n> walkway. He looked sadly at the ruins of his laboratory.\n>\n> From where he worked, Bel Moulay, the bearded leader of the Zenshiite\n> slaves, glowered at the callous inventor. He hated the Poritrin man's\n> pale skin, square-cut hair, and arrogantly colorful clothes. The\n> scientist's frivolous badges of honor meant nothing to Bel Moulay, and\n> all the captive Zenshiites were offended that such a useless, deluded\n> man could flaunt his wealth while stepping on the faithful.\n>\n> In a deep voice the bearded leader gave instructions and consolation\n> to his fellows. Moulay had always been more than just the strongest\n> among them; he was also a religious leader, trained on IV Anbus in the\n> strictest laws of the Zenshiite interpretation of Buddislam. He had\n> learned the true scriptures and sutras, had analyzed every passage;\n> the other slaves looked to Bel Moulay to interpret for them.\n>\n> Despite his faith, he was as helpless as his companions, forced to\n> serve at the whim of nonbelievers. The infidels refused to let\n> Zenshiites live according to their strictures, but insisted on\n> dragging them into their hopeless war against the unholy machine\n> demons. It was a terrible punishment, a set of karmic tribulations\n> visited upon them by Buddallah.\n>\n> But they would see it through, and eventually emerge stronger. . . .\n>\n> Under Bel Moulay's guidance, the slaves moved rubble, uncovering the\n> crushed bodies of companions who had worked alongside them, fellow\n>\n> Zenshiites captured when Tlulaxa slavers raided the canyon cities on\n> IV Anbus.\n>\n> Buddallah would eventually show them the way to freedom. At story\n> fires, the bearded leader had promised that the oppressors would be\n> punished--- if not in this generation, then in the next, or the next.\n> But it would happen. A mere man like Bel Moulay had no business trying\n> to hurry the wishes of God.\n>\n> With excited shouts, two slaves shifted a fallen section of wall to\n> uncover a man who still clung to life, though his legs had been\n> crushed and his torso slashed by shards of windowplaz. Preoccupied,\n> Holtzman came over and scrutinized the injured man. \"I am no medical\n> practitioner, but there seems to be little hope.\"\n>\n> Bel Moulay glowered at him with dark, penetrating eyes. \"Nevertheless,\n> we must do what we can,\" he said in Galach. Three Zenshiite workers\n> scooped away the debris and carried the injured man across the rickety\n> walkway. Inside the slave quarters, healers would work on the\n> injuries.\n>\n> After the accident, Holtzman had provided basic medical supplies,\n> though a similar effort had done little to keep a fever from sweeping\n> through the slave population. The scientist supervised the workers in\n> the rubble, but he was intent on his own priorities.\n>\n> With a frown, the Savant gestured impatiently at the slaves picking up\n> chunks of the collapsed ceiling to uncover victims. \"You and you,\n> leave off digging out bodies for now and excavate what's left of my\n> device.\"\n>\n> The sullen captives looked at Moulay for guidance. He simply shook his\n> head. \"There is no value in resistance now,\" he muttered in their\n> private language. \"But I promise you the time will come.\"\n>\n> Later, during their meager sleep time, they would remove their dead\n> and provide proper Zenshiite blessings and passage preparations for\n> the souls. Burning the bodies of the faithful was not something their\n> religion accepted easily, but it was the way of Poritrin.

The Cogitor Eklo rested on the floorboards of his\n> veranda. Beside the canister sat the big monk, Aquim, rocking back and\n> forth, eyes closed, meditating in a semuta trance.\n>\n> \"What are you doing here?\" Iblis demanded in a hushed voice. Fear\n> clenched his throat. \"If the cymeks find you in the camp, they---\"\n>\n> Aquim opened his bleary eyes. \"Trustee humans are not the only ones\n> who have an understanding with the Titans, and with Omnius. Eklo\n> wishes to speak with you directly.\"\n>\n> Swallowing hard, Iblis looked from the enlarged brain suspended in its\n> electrafluid to the haggard-looking monk. \"What does he want?\"\n>\n> \"Eklo wishes to tell you of earlier abortive human revolts.\" Holding a\n> hand against the preservation canister, he stroked the smooth surface,\n> as if picking up vibrations. \"Have you ever heard of the Hrethgir\n> Rebellions?\"\n>\n> Iblis looked around furtively. He saw none of Omnius's watcheyes.\n> \"That isn't the sort of history slaves are allowed to know, even a\n> crew boss at my level.\"\n>\n> The secondary leaned forward, his brows hooded. He spoke of things he\n> had learned, without connecting directly through the electrafluid to\n> the Cogitor's thoughts. \"Bloody rebellions occurred after the Titans\n> had converted themselves to cymeks, but before Omnius awakened.\n> Feeling themselves immortal, the cymeks became exceedingly brutal.\n> Especially the one called Ajax, who was so vicious in his torment of\n> the surviving humans that his mate Hecate left him and disappeared.\"\n>\n> Iblis said, \"Ajax hasn't changed much over the centuries.\"\n>\n> Aquim's red-rimmed eyes glowed. Eklo's brain trembled inside its\n> nutrient solution. \"Because of the excessive brutality of Ajax,\n> oppressed humans began a rebellion, mainly on Walgis but spreading to\n> Corrin and Richese.\n>\n> The slaves rose up and destroyed two of the original Titans, Alexander\n> and Tamerlane.\n>\n> \"The cymeks responded with a swift and decisive crackdown. Ajax took\n> great delight in closing off Walgis and then methodically\n> exterminating every living human there. Billions were slaughtered.\"\n>\n> Iblis struggled to think. This Cogitor had come all the way from his\n> high tower to see him. The magnitude of such a gesture stunned him.\n> \"Are you telling me that a revolt against the machines is possible, or\n> that it is doomed to failure?\"\n>\n> The big monk extended a rough hand to grab Iblis's wrist. \"Eklo will\n> tell you himself.\"\n>\n> Iblis felt a rush of anxiety, but before he could resist, Aquim\n> pressed the work leader's fingertips into the viscous electrafluid\n> surrounding the Cogitor's ancient brain. The slick solution felt icy\n> cold to Iblis, then hot. The skin on his hand tingled, as if a\n> thousand tiny spiders ran along his flesh.\n>\n> Suddenly he could sense thoughts, words, and impressions flowing\n> directly into his mind from Eklo. \"The revolt failed, but oh what a\n> glorious attempt!\"\n>\n> Iblis received another message, this one wordless, but it conveyed\n> meaning nonetheless, like an epiphany. It was as if the majesty of the\n> universe had opened to him, so many things he had not previously\n> understood . . . so many things Omnius kept the slaves from knowing.\n> Feeling great calm, he immersed his hand deeper into the liquid. His\n> fingertips touched the Cogitor's tissue, ever so gently.\n>\n> \"You are not alone.\" Eklo's words reverberated to his very soul. \"I\n> can help. Aquim can help.\"\n>\n> For several moments, Iblis gazed toward the horizon as the golden sun\n> rose, casting light on enslaved Earth. Now he did not view this story\n> of a failed\n>\n> rebellion as a warning, but as a sign of hope. A better-organized\n> revolt might succeed, given proper guidance and proper planning.

The revelation brought a\n> fervor to his heart. The monk Aquim seemed to share the same passion\n> behind his semuta-dazed expression.\n>\n> \"Nothing is impossible,\" Eklo repeated.\n>\n> Amazed, Iblis removed his hand from the charged fluid and stared at\n> his fingers. The big monk picked up the Cogitor's brain canister and\n> sealed it.

It is the nature of\n> mankind to strive for things they do not have, to steal the rewards\n> that another person might win.

Keedair watched over his work,\n> maintained the details himself, and put tidy profits in his own\n> pockets.\n>\n> He sipped his spice beer again and began to like it even more. \"What's\n> in this stuff?\" When none of the customers seemed interested in\n> conversation, he directed his gaze back at the bartender. \"Is this\n> beer brewed here, or is it an import?\"\n>\n> \"Made on Arrakis, sir.\" When the bartender grinned, his wrinkles\n> folded in upon themselves like a weird origami sculpture made of\n> leather. \"It's brought in by the desert people, Zensunni nomads.\"\n>\n> Keedair's attention perked up at the mention of the Buddislamic sect.\n> \"I'd heard there were a few bands living here in the wastelands. How\n> can I find them?\"\n>\n> \"*Find* them?\" The bartender chuckled. \"Nobody wants to look for them.\n> Dirty, violent folk. They kill strangers.\"\n>\n> Keedair could hardly believe the answer. It took him two tries to\n> formulate his question because the effects of the spice beer had\n> caught him unawares, causing him to slur his words. \"But Zensunni--- I\n> thought they were meek pacifists?\"\n>\n> The bartender emitted a dry cackle. \"Some may be, but these aren't\n> afraid to shed blood to make their point, if you know what I mean.\"\n>\n> \"Are they numerous?\"\n>\n> The bartender scoffed. \"At most, we see only a dozen or two at a time.\n> I'm surprised they're not so inbred that every baby comes out a\n> mutant.\"\n>\n> Keedair's sharp-featured face fell, and he switched his braid to the\n> other shoulder. His plans began to crumble. In addition to the expense\n> of bringing his teams here to Arrakis, his raiders would have to scour\n> the desert just to drag a few sand rats back to market. Keedair sighed\n> and took a long drink of spice beer. Probably not worth the effort.\n> He'd be better off hitting Harmonthep again, even if it made him look\n> bad to other slavers.\n>\n> \"Course, there could be more of them than we realize,\" the bartender\n> said. \"They all look the same wrapped up in desert clothes.\"\n>\n> As Keedair savored the liquor, a tingle went through his body, not\n> quite euphoria, but a rush of well-being. Then an idea lit his mind.\n> He was a businessman, after all, constantly on the lookout for\n> opportunities. It didn't matter where the merchandise came from.\n>\n> \"And what about this spice beer?\" He tapped his nearly empty glass\n> with a stubby fingernail. \"Where do the Zensunnis find ingredients?\n> Doesn't seem to me that anything could grow out there at all.\"\n>\n> \"Spice is a natural substance in the desert. You can find patches out\n> in the dunes, exposed by the wind or spice blows. But monster\n> sandworms live out there, and fierce storms that'll kill you. Let the\n> Zensunnis have the place, if you ask me. The nomads bring in loads of\n> the stuff to Arrakis City, for bartering.\"\n>\n> Keedair considered taking samples of melange back to the League\n> Worlds. Would there be a market for it on rich Salusa, or among the\n> nobles on Poritrin? The substance certainly had an unusual effect on\n> the body . . .\n>\n> soothing in a way he had never experienced before. If he could sell\n> it, he might offset some of the cost of this exploration trip.\n>\n> The bartender nodded toward the door. \"I don't get enough spice beer\n> that I can sell to you as a middleman, but a band of nomads came in\n> this morning. They'll stay inside their tents during the heat of the\n> day, but you'll find them in the market in the evening, on the east\n> end of the spaceport. They'll sell you whatever they have. Just be\n> sure they don't cheat you.\"\n>\n> \"Nobody cheats me,\" Keedair said, revealing his sharp teeth in a cruel\n> grin.\n>\n> He noticed, though, that his words came out alarmingly slurred.\n>\n> He would have to let the spice beer wear off before he met with the\n> Zensunni.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AWNINGS OF BROWN-AND-WHITE fabric offered patches of shade. The nomads\n> sat by themselves, separated from the bustle of the spaceport. These\n> Zensunnis had constructed tents and shelters from scavenged tarpaulins\n> and cargo wrappings. Some of the fabrics appeared to be made from a\n> different kind of polymer, an odd sort of plastic unlike anything\n> Keedair had seen before.\n>\n> The sun fell behind the barricade of mountains, leaving the sky awash\n> with orange pastels and fire hues. A wind came in as the temperature\n> dropped, bringing dust and stinging sand. The awnings flapped and\n> rattled, but the nomads paid no heed, as if the noise were music to\n> them.\n>\n> Keedair approached them alone, still swaying slightly, though he felt\n> clearer-headed after drinking only water for the rest of the afternoon\n> . . . and paying the exorbitant price. Noticing him, two hopeful women\n> went into their stores to haul out items for sale, spreading them on a\n> flat tabletop. One man stood near them, his lean face tattooed with a\n> geometric symbol, his eyes dark and suspicious.\n>\n> Without saying a word, Keedair allowed the women to display their\n> colorful cloths, along with odd-shaped rocks that had been scoured in\n> sandstorms and a few laughably corroded items of long-forgotten\n> technology that Keedair could never sell to even the most gullible and\n> eccentric antique collector. He shook his head gruffly each time until\n> the lean man--- whom one of the women referred to as Naib Dhartha---\n> said he had nothing else.\n>\n> Keedair got to the point. \"I've tasted spice beer. The man who sold it\n> to me suggested I talk to you.\"\n>\n> \"Spice beer,\" Dhartha said. \"Made from melange. Yes, it is\n> obtainable.\" \"How much can you deliver, and what would it cost me?\"\n>\n> The naib spread his hands and revealed a hint of a smile. \"Everything\n> is open to discussion. The price depends on the amount you desire.\n> Enough for a month of personal use?\"\n>\n> \"Why not a cargo ship full?\" Keedair said, noting shock on the faces\n> of the nomads.\n>\n> Dhartha recovered himself quickly. \"That will take time to gather. A\n> month, maybe two.\"\n>\n> \"I can wait--- if we reach an agreement. I've come here with an empty\n> vessel. I need to take something back with me.\" He looked down at the\n> scavenged objects and the wind-scoured art rocks. \"And I certainly\n> don't want to carry anything like *that*. I'd be the laughingstock of\n> the League.\"\n>\n> Despite a natural Tlulaxa interest in biological products, Keedair was\n> not wedded to the business of slavery. He would go his own way and\n> never return to the Thalim solar system, if necessary. Many of the\n> Tlulaxa were religious fanatics anyway, and he grew tired of their\n> dogma and politics. Drugs and drink would always be in demand, and if\n> he could introduce something new and exotic, a drug the richest nobles\n> had never tried, he might turn a handy profit.\n>\n> \"But first tell me exactly what melange is,\" Keedair continued. \"Where\n> does it come from?\"\n>\n> Dhartha gestured to one of the women, who ducked under the sheltered\n> overhang. A hot breeze picked up, and the polymer fabric flapped\n> louder than before. The sun had settled toward the horizon, forcing\n> him to squint as he looked in that direction. This prevented him from\n> reading nuances in the desert man's expression.\n>\n> Within moments, the woman brought out small, steaming cups of a rich\n> black liquid that smelled of pungent cinnamon spice. She served\n> Keedair first, and he looked down, curious but skeptical.\n>\n> \"Coffee mixed with pure melange,\" Dhartha said. \"You will enjoy it.\"\n>\n> Keedair recalled how expensive water had been in the bar and decided\n> that this nomad was investing in their conversation. He took a sip,\n> cautious at first, but could think of no reason why the fellow might\n> poison him. He tasted the hot coffee on his tongue and felt an\n> electric sensation, a delicious taste that reminded him of the spice\n> beer he still had in his system. He would need to be careful, or he\n> would lose his business edge.\n>\n> \"We harvest melange out in the Tanzerouft, the deep desert where the\n> demon sandworms go. It is very dangerous there. We lose many of our\n> people, but the spice is precious.\"\n>\n> Keedair took another drink of coffee and had to stop himself from\n> agreeing too readily. His assessment of the possibilities grew. Now,\n> as the two men shifted positions, Keedair could look upon Dhartha's\n> lean face. The Naib's eyes were not just dark; they were deep blue.\n> Even the whites had taken on a strange indigo tinge. Most odd. He\n> wondered if it could be an unusual defect caused by Zensunni\n> inbreeding.\n>\n> The desert man reached into one of his pockets and withdrew a small\n> box, which he opened to display a compressed, flaky brown powder. He\n> extended it toward Keedair, who stirred the contents with the tip of\n> his little finger.\n>\n> \"Pure melange. Very potent. We use it in our beverages and meals back\n> in the cave villages.\"\n>\n> Keedair touched the spice-speckled tip of his finger to his tongue.\n> The melange was strong and exhilarating, yet soothing. He felt\n> energetic and calm at the same time. His mind seemed sharper, not\n> fuzzed the way excessive alcohol or drugs affected him. But he held\n> back, not wishing to appear overly anxious.\n>\n> \"And if you consume melange over a long period of time,\" Dhartha was\n> saying, \"it helps you retain your health, keeps you young.\"\n>\n> Keedair made no comment. He had heard similar claims about various\n> \"fountain of youth\" substances. None of them, in his experience, had\n> ever proven effective.\n>\n> He snicked shut the cover of the small box and put it in his own\n> pocket, though it had not been offered to him as a gift. He stood. \"I\n> will come back tomorrow. Then we shall talk more. I need to consider\n> this matter.\"\n>\n> The desert naib grunted in affirmation.\n>\n> Keedair walked toward his shuttle within the parking perimeter of the\n> spaceport. His mind spun with preliminary calculations. His fellow\n> slavers would be disappointed at not even attempting a raid, but\n> Keedair would pay them the minimum required by contract. He needed to\n> ponder the possibilities of this potent spice before discussing a\n> price with the nomads. Arrakis was far, far from normal space trading\n> routes. The idea excited him, but he wasn't certain he could\n> profitably export the exotic substance.\n>\n> Realistically, he doubted if melange would ever be more than a mere\n> curiosity.\n>\n> *Humans are survivors. They do things for themselves and then attempt\n> to conceal their motivations through elaborate subterfuges.\n> Gift-giving is a prime example of behavior that is secretly selfish.*\n>\n> --- ERASMUS,\n\nslave pen notes\n\n> **S**hortly before midnight, Aurelius Venport sat at a long opalwood\n> table in an echoing chamber deep inside the Rossak cave city. He had\n> furnished this room for his business meetings with drug prospectors,\n> biochemists, and pharmaceutical merchants, but Zufa Cenva sometimes\n> used it for her own private meetings.\n>\n> Even in the late darkness, the chief Sorceress was out in the\n> dangerous jungles, training her young prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and preparing them for\n> suicide attacks. Venport did not know whether Zufa was eager or afraid\n> for her volunteers to be called again.\n>\n> He very much hoped his mate didn't get ideas of her own, though she\n> would probably love to make herself a martyr. Zufa took him for\n> granted, blamed him for his imagined failings, but still Venport cared\n> for the cold, pale Sorceress. He didn't want to lose her.\n>\n> Zufa had been due back more than an hour ago, and he'd been waiting\n> for her. It did him no good to be impatient, though. The haughty\n> Sorceress operated on her own schedule, considering his priorities\n> unimportant.\n>\n> Even in the darkest night, the cave room was illuminated by warm,\n> comforting light--- a glowing yellow sphere that floated gracefully\n> above the table like a portable, personal sun. Dear Norma had sent it\n> to him from Poritrin as a gift, a compact light source levitated by a\n> new suspensor field she had developed. Based on the same principle as\n> a glowpanel, but much more efficient, the device generated\n> illumination as a by-product of the suspensor field itself. Norma\n> called it a glowglobe, and he'd been considering its commercial\n> possibilities.\n>\n> Venport took a long drink of bitter herbal ale from a goblet in front\n> of him. He grimaced, then drank some more, trying to bolster his\n> nerve. Zufa should be here any minute, and he was anxious to see her.\n> Out in the jungles the Sorceresses had erected a shrine to honor\n> fallen Heoma. Maybe they were all there now, dancing around it under\n> the starlight, chanting incantations like witches. Or maybe--- despite\n> their cool, agnostic logic and determination--- they chose private\n> moments to worship a Gaia life force, an Earth mother that embodied\n> feminine power. Anything to set them apart from what they considered\n> to be \"weakling\" men . . .\n>\n> Beckoned by the glowglobe, nightbugs flew into the room from the outer\n> corridors. The nocturnal insects had a voracious appetite for human\n> blood, but only men were bothered. It was one of the jokes of Rossak,\n> as if the Sorceresses had cast some sort of a spell on the tiny\n> creatures to keep their men inside during the evenings, while women\n> performed secret rites out in the jungles.\n>\n> Another quarter of an hour passed, and still Zufa did not join him.\n> Frustrated with her, Venport finished the ale and set the empty goblet\n> on the opalwood table, heaving a disgusted sigh. He rarely asked to\n> see her, but this was important to him. Couldn't she give him just a\n> few moments of her precious time?\n>\n> Still, he would continue to seek her understanding and respect. For\n> years, Venport had enjoyed substantial success in exporting medical\n> narcotics and pharmaceuticals manufactured from Rossak plants. In the\n> past month, his men had turned a large profit from the sale of\n> psychedelics to Yardin. The drugs had become a favorite of the\n> Buddislamic mystics who ran the place. The mystics used the Rossak\n> hallucinogen in religious rituals, attempting to attain enlightenment.\n>\n> Venport stared at a large, milky soostone on the table. A smuggler\n> from Buzzell, one of the Unallied Planets, had sold him the extremely\n> rare and valuable stone. The dealer had claimed that some soostones of\n> extraordinary purity possessed hypnotic focusing abilities. He wanted\n> Zufa\n>\n> to wear it with pride, perhaps on a pendant. The Sorceress could use\n> it to make herself stronger.\n>\n> He inserted a rolled slip of alkaloid bark into his mouth and crunched\n> down, knowing it would make him relax. He dimmed the glowglobe and\n> adjusted its spectrum to a more orange light, which caused the\n> soostone to dance with rainbow colors. The alkaloid bark made him feel\n> tingly, calm . . . and distant. The uncommon stone shimmered\n> hypnotically, and he lost track of time.\n>\n> When Zufa entered the room, her pale face was flushed, her eyes\n> bright. She looked like an ethereal creature in the room's rich glow.\n> She wore a long diaphanous gown with tiny jewels sparkling across it\n> like a field of ruby flowers.\n>\n> \"I see you have nothing important to do,\" she said, already frowning.\n>\n> He gathered his wits about him. \"Nothing more important than waiting\n> for you.\" Rising to his feet with all the pride he could muster, he\n> picked up the soostone. \"I found this, and I thought of you. A gift\n> from Buzzell, where my merchants made an extraordinary profit from---\"\n> Noticing an expression of disdain on her face, Venport felt flustered.\n> His voice trailed off.\n>\n> \"And what am I supposed to do with it?\" She examined the offering,\n> without touching it. \"When have I ever cared for pretty baubles?\"\n>\n> \"It's a rare soostone, said to have certain . . . telepathic\n> enhancement characteristics. Perhaps you can use it as a focusing\n> device when you instruct your trainees?\" She stood like a statue,\n> unimpressed, and he continued in a rush, \"The Buddislamics on Yardin\n> are clamoring for our psychedelics. I've made a lot of credits in the\n> past few months, and I thought this was something you might\n> appreciate.\"\n>\n> \"I'm tired and I'm going to bed,\" she said, letting him keep the\n> present. \"My Sorceresses have already proven their abilities. With\n> machines still threatening every League world, we don't have time to\n> stare into soostones.\"\n>\n> He shook his head. What would it have cost her merely to accept his\n> gift? Could she not at least have offered him a word of kindness? Hurt\n> so deeply that even the calming bark could not soothe him, Venport\n> shouted, \"If we give up our humanity to fight the machines, Zufa, then\n> Omnius has already won!\"\n>\n> She hesitated just a moment, but did not turn back to him. Instead,\n> she went to her chambers and left him standing alone.\n>\n> *In surviving, shall our humanity endure? That which makes life sweet\n> for the living--- warm and filled with beauty--- this, too, must be.\n> But we shall not gain this enduring humanity if we deny our whole\n> being--- if we deny emotion, thought, and flesh. If we deny emotion,\n> we lose all touch with our universe. By denying thought, we cannot\n> reflect upon what we touch. And if we dare deny the flesh, we unwheel\n> the vehicle that carries us all.*\n\n--- PRIMERO VORIAN ATREIDES,\n\n*Annals of the Army of the Jihad*\n\n> **E**arth. In a drizzle of summer rain, Vorian rode inside an\n> exquisite white coach, drawn by four prancing white stallions. Erasmus\n> had ordered the robot coachman to wear a uniform with broad military\n> lapels, dripping golden ribbons and a tricorner hat taken from an\n> ancient historical image.\n>\n> The extravagance was inefficient and unnecessary--- not to mention\n> anachronistic--- but the human trustee had heard that eccentric\n> Erasmus often did inexplicable things. Vor could not imagine why such\n> an important representative of the evermind would want to see *him*.\n>\n> Perhaps Erasmus had studied some of the simulations and war games\n> Vorian had played with Seurat. He knew that the robot had built\n> extensive laboratories to research the questions about human nature\n> that plagued his inquisitive mind. *But what could I possibly tell\n> him?*\n>\n> As the carriage wheels clattered over cobblestones in front of the\n> manor house, Vor wiped fog from the window. Even in the rain, the\n> imposing Grogyptian-style villa was more magnificent than the\n> efficient grid-organized cities. It seemed fit for a prince.\n>\n> With ornamental gardens and enough tile-roofed buildings to comprise a\n> small village, the sprawling estate covered many acres. The\n> balcony-adorned main house featured tall fluted columns and winged\n> gargoyles that looked down on a reception plaza as large as a town\n> square crowded with\n>\n> fountains and twisted sculptures, paved gathering areas and\n> stone-walled outbuildings.\n>\n> *What am I doing here?*\n>\n> Two liveried humans approached, averting their eyes as if Vor was a\n> visiting machine dignitary. One man opened the door, while the other\n> helped him step down. \"Erasmus waits to see you.\" The white horses\n> pranced and fidgeted, perhaps because they received few opportunities\n> to exercise.\n>\n> One of the liveried men held a rain cover to shield Vor's dark hair\n> from the drizzle. Dressed in a sleeveless tunic and light trousers, he\n> shivered. He hated being drenched, and the discomfort only reminded\n> him of the flaws and weaknesses of his human body. If he were a cymek,\n> he could have easily adjusted his internal temperature, and\n> thoughtrodes could delete annoying sensual responses. *Someday*.\n>\n> Inside the entry, a beautiful young woman greeted him. \"Vorian\n> Atreides?\" She had exotic lavender eyes and a flashing independence in\n> contrast to the cowed men in livery. The barest hint of a challenging\n> smile curved her lips. \"So, you are the son of the evil Agamemnon?\"\n>\n> Taken aback, Vor drew himself up. \"My father is a revered general,\n> first among the Titans. His military exploits are legendary.\"\n>\n> \"Or infamous.\" The woman stared at him with a shocking lack of\n> respect.\n>\n> Vor didn't know how to react. Lower-caste humans on the Synchronized\n> Worlds all knew their places, and she couldn't be a trustee, like\n> himself. No other slave had ever spoken to him in such a manner. As a\n> reward after his numerous update missions, Vor had been granted the\n> services of pleasure slaves, women assigned to warm his bed. He had\n> never asked any of them their identities. \"I want to know your name\n> because I wish to remember it,\" he said, at last. He found something\n> intriguing about this exotically beautiful woman and her unexpected\n> defiance.\n>\n> She sounded as proud of her lineage as Vor was. \"I am Serena Butler.\"\n> She led him along a corridor lined with statuary and paintings, then\n> into a botanical garden shielded from the rain by a glass-paneled\n> ceiling.\n>\n> \"What do you do here? Are you one of Erasmus's . . . privileged\n> trainees?\"\n>\n> \"I am just a house slave, but unlike you, I don't serve the thinking\n> machines by choice.\"\n>\n> He took her comment as a badge of honor. \"Yes, I serve them and\n> proudly. I am helping to achieve the best that is possible for our\n> flawed species.\"\n>\n> \"By collaborating with Omnius, you are a willing traitor to your race.\n> To the free humans, you are as evil as your machine masters. Or hasn't\n> that ever occurred to you before?\"\n>\n> Vor was baffled. The human military commander at Giedi Prime had made\n> similar accusations. \"Evil . . . in what way? Can't you see the good\n> that Omnius has accomplished? It's so obvious. Simply look at the\n> Synchronized Worlds. Every detail is seen to, everything runs\n> smoothly. Why would anyone want to disrupt that?\"\n>\n> Serena gazed at him, as if trying to decide whether he truly meant\n> what he said. Finally, she shook her head. \"You are a fool, a slave\n> who cannot see his chains. It's not worth the effort to convince you.\"\n> Abruptly she turned away from him and marched ahead, leaving him\n> speechless. \"For all your supposed training, you simply don't know any\n> better.\"\n>\n> Before he could think of a suitable response, Vor noticed the\n> independent robot. Garbed in opulent robes, Erasmus stood by a shallow\n> pool, his oval face reflecting the water. Raindrops fell from an\n> opening cut through the glass ceiling, wetting him. Classical music\n> played a soothing melody in the background.\n>\n> Without announcing Vor's arrival, Serena left. Surprised by her\n> rudeness, he stared after her. He admired her face and amber-brown\n> hair, as well as her bearing and obvious intelligence. Her waist was\n> thick, and he wondered if\n>\n> she was pregnant. Paradoxically, her arrogance made her more\n> captivating, the desirability of something unattainable.\n>\n> Obviously, Serena Butler had not accepted her place as a household\n> servant. Considering the squalid lives of slaves in the unkempt pens\n> behind the villa, what did she have to complain about? It made no\n> sense.\n>\n> \"Outspoken, is she not?\" said Erasmus, still standing in the rain. The\n> robot shifted his pliable face into a congenial smile.\n>\n> Standing away from the cool drizzle, Vor said, \"I am surprised you\n> tolerate her annoying attitude.\"\n>\n> \"Attitudes can be enlightening.\" Erasmus turned back to his study of\n> the raindrops in the reflecting pool. \"I find her interesting.\n> Refreshingly honest\n>\n> --- much as you are.\" The robot took a step toward him. \"I have\n> reached an impasse in my study of human behavior because most of my\n> subjects are drawn from docile captives who have been bred to slavery.\n> They have never known any life but one of service and subjugation, and\n> do not show any *spark*. They are sheep, while you, Vorian Atreides,\n> are a wolf. And so is this Serena Butler . . . in her own way.\"\n>\n> The visitor bowed, swelling with pride. \"I am happy to assist you in\n> any manner, Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \"I trust you enjoyed the coach ride? I breed the stallions and keep\n> them groomed for important occasions. You gave me an excuse to use\n> them.\"\n>\n> \"It was an unusual experience,\" Vor admitted. \"A most . . . archaic\n> mode of transportation.\"\n>\n> \"Come stand here in the rain with me.\" Erasmus beckoned with a\n> synthetic hand. \"It is pleasant, I assure you.\"\n>\n> Vor stepped forward as he was told, trying not to show discomfort. The\n> rain quickly soaked his tunic, moistened his bare arms; water trickled\n> from his\n>\n> clumped dark hair, down his forehead and into his eyes. \"Yes, Erasmus.\n> It's . . . pleasant.\"\n>\n> The robot simulated a laugh. \"You are lying.\"\n>\n> With good humor, Vor said, \"It is what humans do best.\"\n>\n> Mercifully, the robot led them out of the rain. \"Let us discuss\n> Serena. She is attractive, according to human standards of beauty, is\n> she not?\" Vor didn't know what to say, but Erasmus pressed him, \"I\n> watched you with her. You would like to procreate with that feral\n> human, would you not? She is currently carrying the child of a\n> *hrethgir* lover, but we will have plenty of time. She is unlike any\n> simple pleasure slave you have been assigned?\"\n>\n> Vor pondered the questions, wondering what the robot really wanted to\n> know. \"Well, she is beautiful . . . and enticing.\"\n>\n> Erasmus made an artificial sound, something like a sigh. \"Sadly,\n> despite my numerous sensitive upgrades, I remain unable to experience\n> sexual activity, at least not in the way a biological male does. I\n> have spent centuries designing upgrades and modifications that might\n> replicate the sensations of ecstasy that even the lowliest human can\n> enjoy. Thus far, there has been little progress. My attempts with\n> female slaves have been alarmingly unsuccessful.\"\n>\n> Strolling along in his fine clothes, Erasmus gestured for Vor to\n> follow him through the greenhouse. As they walked down garden paths,\n> the regal machine identified various plants by name and origin, as if\n> he were lecturing a child or bragging about his knowledge. \"Serena\n> knows a great deal about plants herself. She was something of a\n> horticulturist on Salusa Secundus.\"\n>\n> Vor made polite responses, trying to guess how he could help the\n> robot. He wiped water from his eyes; his damp clothes felt clammy and\n> unpleasant.\n>\n> Finally Erasmus explained why he had summoned the young trustee.\n> \"Vorian Atreides, your father recently gave you a biological\n> life-extension\n>\n> treatment.\" The mechanical face shifted back to a smooth mirror, so as\n> not to give Vor a clue about what he wanted. \"Tell me, how do you\n> *feel* now that you have had centuries added to your lifespan? Surely,\n> it is a great gift from Agamemnon, as significant as his original\n> sperm donation.\"\n>\n> Before Vor could consider the question, Serena entered the greenhouse\n> carrying a silver tea set. She placed the tray with a rough clatter on\n> a polished stone table and poured dark liquid into two cups. She\n> handed one to Vor and one to the robot. Erasmus extruded a fibrous,\n> feathery-tipped probe into the tea, as if tasting it. His mirrored\n> mask shifted into an expression of supreme pleasure. \"Excellent,\n> Serena. A remarkable and interesting flavor!\"\n>\n> Vor did not care for the taste himself; the tea reminded him of bitter\n> chocolate mixed with spoiled fruit juices. Serena seemed amused at his\n> expression.\n>\n> \"It is good?\" Erasmus asked. \"Serena prepared it especially for you. I\n> let her choose an appropriate recipe.\"\n>\n> \"The flavor is . . . unique.\"\n>\n> The robot laughed. \"You are lying again.\"\n>\n> \"No, Erasmus. I am avoiding a direct response.\"\n>\n> Vor saw hostility in Serena's unusual eyes as she looked at him, and\n> he wondered if she had ruined the tea on purpose. Leaving the tray on\n> the stone table, she departed, saying, \"Maybe I should attend a\n> trustee school to learn how to be a better simpering servant.\"\n>\n> Vor watched Serena, surprised that Erasmus ignored her rudeness. \"It\n> amuses me to watch her attempts at resistance, Vorian. Harmless\n> defiance. She knows she can never escape.\" During a moment of silence,\n> the robot continued to study him. \"You did not answer my question\n> about the life extension.\"\n>\n> Now that he'd had time to ponder, Vor said, \"Honestly, I'm not sure\n> how I feel about it. My human body is fragile, easily damaged. Though\n> I am still prone to accidents or sickness, at least I will not grow\n> old and weak.\" Vor thought about all the years remaining to him, like\n> credits to spend. He would live several human lifespans, but becoming\n> a cymek would be so much more important. \"Even so, my extra years are\n> only the blink of an eye compared to the life of a thinking machine\n> such as yourself.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, the blink of an eye, an involuntary human reflex I can\n> understand physically and conceptually. You use it as an inexact\n> metaphor to indicate a brief period of time.\"\n>\n> Noticing watcheye screens on the greenhouse walls, Vor realized that\n> the evermind must be eavesdropping. \"Are you always this curious?\"\n>\n> \"Curiosity is how one learns,\" Erasmus said. \"I inquire because I am\n> inquisitive. That makes sense, does it not? Enlighten me. I would like\n> to speak with you again. You--- and Serena--- can give me an\n> interesting perspective.\"\n>\n> Vor bowed. \"As you wish, Erasmus. However, I must coordinate such\n> visits with my important work for Omnius. Soon the *Dream Voyager*\n> will be repaired and ready to depart on another update run.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, we all work for Omnius.\" Erasmus paused. Overhead, through the\n> murky ceiling of the greenhouse, the rain had stopped, leaving patchy\n> openings of blue sky. \"Think more about mortality and longevity. Come\n> and speak to me again before departing on your next voyage.\"\n>\n> \"I will seek permission to do so, Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> INTRIGUED BY THE fascinating interplay between the two humans, Erasmus\n> summoned Serena again and commanded her to escort their guest back to\n> his coach. She had been outwardly hostile to this son of Agamemnon,\n> while he was clearly interested in her . . . physically? . . .\n>\n> mentally? And how could one tell the difference? Another experiment,\n> perhaps?\n>\n> Even though they had exchanged few words, Vorian found his imagination\n> filled with this young woman. He had never met a female like her, with\n> such self-confident beauty, intelligence, and willingness to speak her\n> mind. Obviously Serena Butler had been raised to value herself as an\n> individual--- much as Erasmus worked hard to perfect his own\n> independence.\n>\n> Reaching the outer doorway of the villa, the young man blurted, \"When\n> is your baby due?\" At the coach, the horses seemed anxious to be off.\n> The uniformed robot driver sat like a statue.\n>\n> Serena's eyes widened with annoyance. She was about to retort that it\n> was none of his business, but she stopped short. Perhaps Vorian\n> Atreides was just the opportunity she had been hoping for. He had\n> information that might help her escape, and he had the trust of the\n> machines. It would be foolish to alienate him from the outset. If she\n> befriended him instead, might she not be able to show him what a free\n> human being could be?\n>\n> She drew a deep breath and smiled uncertainly. \"I'm not prepared to\n> discuss my baby with a complete stranger. But maybe next time you\n> come, we could talk. That might be a place to start.\" There. She had\n> done it.\n>\n> With that, she went inside the villa and carefully shut the door\n> behind her.\n>\n> As she watched the coach from the portico of the towering villa,\n> Serena Butler felt uncertain and confused about this deluded man who\n> so proudly served the machines. She didn't like him, wasn't sure she\n> could ever trust him. But perhaps he could be helpful.\n>\n> Feeling uneasy, and damp from the rain and mist in the outside air,\n> she hurried back inside to dry herself and change her clothes. With\n> the precious baby growing inside her womb, six months along now, she\n> thought of her beloved Xavier. Could Vorian help her return to him, or\n> would her child grow up in captivity, never to know its father?\n\n> *Of all the subjects of human behavior, two are most storied: warfare\n> and love.*\n>\n> --- COGITOR EKLO,\n>\n> *Ruminations on Things Lost*\n>\n> **T**he tragic loss of Serena had left Xavier off course, struggling\n> to regain the momentum of his life. Three months earlier, he had seen\n> the wreckage of her blockade runner floating in the seas of Giedi\n> Prime, and had read the indisputable DNA analysis of the blood samples\n> found inside.\n>\n> He did not claim to understand his feelings, and avoided them by\n> letting his work consume him. At first he had wanted to fling himself\n> recklessly at another machine stronghold, but Serena would have\n> scolded him for that. The thought of her disapproval was the only\n> thing that had stopped him.\n>\n> She had died fighting the inhuman enemy. Xavier needed an anchor to\n> grasp, some form of stability before moving on. For the sake of her\n> memory, the struggle must continue until every thinking machine had\n> been destroyed.\n>\n> Xavier's mind drifted to Octa, the haunting reminder of her sister.\n> Lovely in her own right, she was sensitive and introspective, rather\n> than the goal-driven crusader Serena had been. Still, in subtle ways,\n> the willowy girl reminded him achingly of Serena, in the shape of her\n> mouth and the gentle smile. It was like the echo of a pleasant memory.\n> Xavier found himself torn between staring longingly at Octa and\n> avoiding her entirely.\n>\n> She was there to comfort him when he grieved, gave him space when he\n> needed it, and cheered him when he wanted that. Quietly and gently,\n> Octa was filling a void in his life. Although their relationship\n> remained tranquil and unremarkable, she showed him attentive love.\n> Where Serena had been a storm of emotions, her sister was steady and\n> predictable.\n>\n> One day, on an impulse driven more by grief and longing than common\n> sense, Xavier asked Octa to become his wife. She had looked at him\n> with wide eyes, astonished. \"I am afraid to move, Xavier, to utter a\n> sound, because I must be dreaming.\"\n>\n> He had worn his clean and pressed Armada uniform bearing his new rank\n> insignia as Segundo. Xavier stood straight, his hands clasped, as if\n> addressing a superior officer, rather than asking Octa to join him as\n> his life mate. He had always known that Serena's sister had a girlish,\n> unrealistic infatuation with him, and now he hoped it could grow into\n> genuine love.\n>\n> \"In choosing you to marry me, dear Octa, I can think of no braver way\n> to march forward into the future. It is our best chance to honor\n> Serena's memory.\"\n>\n> The words sounded like a formal speech, but Octa flushed as if they\n> were a magical incantation. Aware that this was the wrong reason to\n> betroth himself to her, Xavier tried to dispel the uneasiness. He had\n> made up his mind and hoped that they could soothe each others' wounds.\n>\n> Both Manion and Livia Butler accepted and encouraged the shifting of\n> Xavier's affections; they even rushed the nuptials. Now the bridge\n> across an emotional chasm had been severed, and they believed the\n> match with Octa would benefit all of them.\n>\n> On the day of his wedding, Xavier searched for an inner peace, doing\n> his best to lock away the portion of his heart that would always\n> belong to Serena. He still longed for the peal of her laugh, for her\n> outspokenness, for the electric touch of her skin. Taking a few\n> private moments, he reviewed his favorite memories of her one by one\n> in his mind, and then, tearfully, set them aside.\n>\n> From now on, gentle Octa would be his wife. He would not hurt the\n> already-fragile girl by wallowing in regrets, or by comparing her to\n> her sister. That would be dishonest and unfair to her.\n>\n> A number of League representatives had gathered at the hilltop Butler\n> estate, where seven months earlier Xavier and Serena had participated\n> in the raucous bristleback hunt. Nearby, in the courtyard, they had\n> held the gala betrothal celebration filled with music and dancing---\n> but ending with the terrible news of Giedi Prime's fall.\n>\n> At Xavier's insistence, the wedding took place inside a new pavilion\n> with vistas of vineyards and olive groves. The fabric structure was so\n> resplendent and intricate in its workmanship that it cost more than a\n> modest house. Out in front, three large banners fluttered in a gentle\n> breeze, designating the households of Butler and Harkonnen, and of\n> Tantor, Xavier's adoptive family. In the valley below, the white\n> buildings of Zimia shone in sunlight, with wide avenues and large\n> administration complexes refurbished in the fourteen months since the\n> cymek attack.\n>\n> The ceremony was small and somber, despite the guests' pretenses and\n> Manion Butler's insistent merriment. New memories would supplant the\n> old ones. Smiling as he had not done in months, the Viceroy strutted\n> from guest to guest under the colorful awnings, tasting punch recipes\n> and sampling the cornucopia of cheeses and wines.\n>\n> The silent bride and groom stood by a small altar at the front of the\n> crowded tent, holding hands. Dressed in the pale-blue gown of\n> traditional Salusan weddings, Octa looked ethereal, lovely and fragile\n> beside him. Her strawberry-blond hair was held neatly in place with\n> pearl-head pins.\n>\n> Some would say this rushed marriage to Serena's sister was a reaction\n> to Xavier's grief, but he knew he was taking the honorable course. He\n> reminded himself a thousand times that Serena would have approved.\n> Together, he and Octa would bring closure to so much pain and sadness.\n>\n> Inside the flower-decked pavilion stood Abbess Livia Butler, her\n> amber-brown hair highlighted by sparkling golden strands. She had come\n> from the City of Introspection to perform the ceremony. Confident and\n> proud, as if she had purged all doubts and sorrow from her mind, Livia\n> looked at the bride and groom, then smiled at her husband. Manion\n> Butler barely fit into\n>\n> his red and gold tuxedo. Soft flesh poked out at the neck and at the\n> ends of the sleeves.\n>\n> A group of players began to strum their balisets. A boy with a sweet\n> tenor voice sang slowly. Beside Xavier, Octa seemed to be in her own\n> dreamy world, not quite certain how to react to the turn of\n> circumstances. She squeezed his hand, and he raised it to his lips and\n> kissed it.\n>\n> Ever since the death of her twin brother Fredo, Octa had developed an\n> ability to shut things out, never overwhelming herself with\n> large-scale concerns but instead preferring smaller tableaux. Such a\n> limited focus might permit her to be happy, and Xavier, too.\n>\n> Tears glistening in his expressive eyes, Viceroy Butler stepped\n> forward to clasp their hands. After a long moment he turned solemnly\n> to his wife, and nodded. Abbess Livia began to intone the ceremony.\n> \"We are here to sing a song of love, a song that has joined men and\n> women since the earliest days of civilization.\"\n>\n> As Octa smiled up at Xavier, he could almost imagine she was Serena,\n> but he drove the troubling image away. He and Octa loved each other in\n> a different way. Their bond grew stronger each time he held her in his\n> arms. Xavier had only to accept the warmth that she readily bestowed\n> on him.\n>\n> Before them, Livia spoke the traditional words, the roots of which\n> extended back to the Panchristian and Buddislamic texts of ancient\n> times. The lilting phrases were beautiful, and Xavier's mind kept\n> expanding outward, thinking forward and backward. The words were\n> infinitely calm and reassuring as Abbess Livia guided the young couple\n> through their vows.\n>\n> Soon everything necessary had been said. As he shared the ritual of\n> love and placed a ring on Octa's finger, Xavier Harkonnen pledged his\n> eternal devotion to her. Not even the thinking machines could tear\n> this relationship apart.\n>\n> *Talk is based on the assumption that you can get somewhere if you\n> keep puttingone word after another.*\n\n--- IBLIS GINJO,\n\nnotes in the margin of a stolen notebook\n\n> **A**jax strode his intimidating walker-form into the Forum Plaza,\n> inspecting every operation, searching for flaws. With his array of\n> optic threads, the Titan scanned the polished colossus that showed his\n> long-forgotten human form. Ajax was frustrated that Iblis Ginjo had\n> maintained such a careful watch that he could find no excuse to impose\n> amusing punishments. . . .\n>\n> In turmoil, Iblis watched for an opportunity of his own. His\n> imagination kept returning to the remarkable things he had learned\n> from the Cogitor Eklo, especially details of the glorious failure of\n> the Hrethgir Rebellions. Ajax personified the brutality and pain of\n> those long-ago battles.\n>\n> Could the Cogitor help Iblis to spread the quiet fires of a brewing\n> revolution? They could learn from the mistakes of the past attempts.\n> Had there ever been a rebel of trustee stature, like Iblis? And how\n> could the secondary Aquim assist him?\n>\n> Despite his subtle investigations, his ability to manipulate\n> conversations and make others unwittingly divulge their secrets, Iblis\n> had not yet found evidence of other resistance groups. Perhaps their\n> leadership was scattered, disorganized, weak. Who had sent him the\n> secret messages--- five in the past three months?\n>\n> The lack of evidence frustrated Iblis, because he wanted to push the\n> uprising forward, now that he had made up his mind. On the other hand,\n> if the dissenters were too easily found, they would have no chance\n> against the organized thinking machines.\n>\n> After pushing his slaves particularly hard and finishing his assigned\n> labors, Iblis asked to take another pilgrimage to Eklo's stone tower.\n> Only the\n>\n> Cogitor could give him the answers he needed. When he spoke with the\n> administrative cymek Dante, showing records that demonstrated his\n> productivity and efficiency, the Titan bureaucrat granted him\n> permission to leave the city grid. Dante made it clear, however, that\n> he didn't understand why a mere work supervisor would be interested in\n> nonproductive philosophical issues. It seemed to go beyond the\n> interests of most trustees. \"It will not benefit you.\"\n>\n> \"I'm sure you are right, Lord Dante . . . but it amuses me.\"\n>\n> Setting out before dawn, Iblis urged the smelly burrhorse into the\n> rocky desert and up the slopes to the monastery. Aquim awaited him at\n> the steep circular stairs to the tower, again looking disheveled and\n> somewhat dazed from semuta. From the first time Iblis had immersed his\n> hand in electrafluid and touched the Cogitor's thoughts, he could not\n> imagine why Aquim wanted to dull his perceptions. Perhaps the complex\n> enlightened thoughts of Eklo were so vast and overwhelming that the\n> big-shouldered secondary needed to dampen the flood of confusing\n> revelations.\n>\n> \"I see you look at me with disapproval,\" Aquim said, peering out\n> through slitted eyelids.\n>\n> \"Oh no,\" Iblis said. Then, realizing he could not get away with lying,\n> he said, \"I was just noticing that you enjoy your semuta.\"\n>\n> The big man smiled and spoke in a voice that slurred slightly. \"To an\n> outsider, it may appear that I have deadened my senses, but semuta\n> permits me to forget my own destructive past, before I was inspired to\n> join Cogitor Eklo. It also enables me to focus on what is really\n> important, ignoring the sensual distractions of the flesh.\"\n>\n> \"I can't picture you as a destructive man.\"\n>\n> \"Oh, but I was. My father fought against enslavement and died in the\n> attempt. Afterward, I sought revenge against the machines, and I was\n> good at it. I led a small band of men, and we . . . damaged some\n> robots. I am sorry to say that we also killed a number of trustee\n> slaves who got in our\n>\n> way, men such as yourself. Then Eklo arranged for my rescue, and for\n> my rehabilitation of sorts. He never told me why he sought me out, or\n> how he made the arrangements. There are many things the Cogitor does\n> not reveal to anyone, not even to me.\"\n>\n> Abruptly, the monk turned and plodded unsteadily up the stairs,\n> leading Iblis to the chamber where the Cogitor lived in a state of\n> eternal contemplation. Standing in the tower room with the\n> color-bathed observation windows, Aquim said, \"Eklo has considered\n> your situation at length. Long ago he watched the changes in humanity\n> after the Titans crushed the Old Empire, but he did nothing. Eklo\n> thought the challenge and adversity would improve the human race by\n> strengthening their minds, forcing them out of their sleepwalking\n> existence.\"\n>\n> The monk wiped a stain from the corner of his mouth. \"By separating\n> their minds from their bodies, the cymek Titans could have become\n> enlightened, like Cogitors. That was Eklo's hope when he assisted\n> Juno. But the Titans never rose above their animal flaws. This\n> weakness enabled Omnius to conquer them, and humanity.\" Aquim stepped\n> toward the translucent brain canister resting on a window shelf. \"Eklo\n> believes you may be able to institute a change.\"\n>\n> Iblis's heart leaped. \"Nothing is impossible.\" But he knew he could\n> not fight the machines by himself, would need to find others to help\n> him. *Many others.*\n>\n> Before the transparent window, Eklo's plexiplaz container glistened in\n> a wash of golden morning sunlight. In the distance, Iblis could see\n> the unending skyline of megaliths and monuments designed by the cymeks\n> and built with human sweat and blood. *Do I really want to see them\n> all crumble to dust?*\n>\n> The crew boss hesitated as he considered the consequences, remembering\n> the billions of victims of the Hrethgir Rebellions on Walgis and other\n> worlds. Then he sensed an intrusion into his thoughts, something\n> bumping against them.\n>\n> Aquim removed the covering of the Cogitor's canister, exposing the\n> nutrient fluid that supported the ancient mind. \"Come, Eklo wishes to\n> make direct contact with you.\"\n>\n> The tank's nutrient solution was like amniotic fluid, tingling with\n> immeasurable mental energy. Tentative, fighting his eagerness to know\n> and learn, Iblis dipped his fingers into the electrafluid, touching\n> the slippery surface of Eklo's brain and unlocking all the thoughts\n> the Cogitor wanted to give him.\n>\n> Aquim stood to one side with a strange expression on his face, part\n> beatific complacence, part envy.\n>\n> \"Neutrality is a delicate balancing act,\" Eklo said directly into\n> Iblis's mind, through the neurelectric contact promulgated by the\n> organic circuitry. \"Long ago, I answered Juno's many questions about\n> how to overthrow the Old Empire. My unbiased answers and advice\n> allowed the Titans to formulate successful plans, and the course of\n> the human race was forever changed. For many centuries I reconsidered\n> what I did.\" The brain seemed to press against Iblis's fingertips. \"It\n> is essential for all Cogitors to maintain absolute neutrality. We must\n> be objective.\"\n>\n> Puzzled, Iblis said, \"Then why are you speaking to me? Why have you\n> raised the possibility that the machines might be overthrown?\"\n>\n> \"In order to reestablish the balance of neutrality,\" Eklo said. \"Once,\n> I inadvertently assisted the Titans, so I must now answer your\n> questions with the same objectivity. In the final analysis, I will\n> have maintained equilibrium.\"\n>\n> Iblis swallowed hard. \"Then you have foreseen where it all ends?\"\n>\n> \"There are endings all around us, and beginnings. You alone can decide\n> where you are on the path.\"\n>\n> As Iblis's thoughts spun, searching for useful questions about machine\n> weaknesses and vulnerabilities, Eklo intruded, \"I cannot provide\n> concrete\n>\n> military or political details, but if you phrase your questions\n> cleverly enough, as Juno did, then you shall have what you need. The\n> art of cleverness is a prime lesson of life. You must outwit the\n> machines, Iblis Ginjo.\"\n>\n> For more than an hour, Eklo guided Iblis. \"I have considered this\n> problem for many centuries, long before you came to me. And if you do\n> not succeed, I shall consider it even longer.\"\n>\n> \"But I can't fail. I must succeed.\"\n>\n> \"It will take more than desire on your part. You must tap into the\n> deepest emotions of the masses.\" Eklo fell silent for several moments.\n>\n> Iblis struggled to comprehend, trying to stretch his thoughts. \"Love,\n> hate, fear? Is that what you mean?\"\n>\n> \"They are components, yes.\"\n>\n> \"Components?\"\n>\n> \"Of religion. The machines are very powerful, and it will take more\n> than a mere political or social uprising to defeat them. The people\n> must coalesce around a powerful idea that goes even deeper, into the\n> very essence of their existence, what it means to be human. You must\n> be more than a trustee, but a visionary leader. Slaves need to rise up\n> in a great holy war against the machines, an unstoppable jihad to\n> overthrow their masters.\"\n>\n> \"A holy war? A jihad? But how can I do that?\"\n>\n> \"I tell you only what I sense, Iblis Ginjo, what I have thought and\n> envisioned. You must go out and discover the rest of the answers for\n> yourself. But know this: Of all human wars in history, a jihad is the\n> most passionate, conquering worlds and civilizations, mowing down\n> everything in its path.\"\n>\n> \"And the people sending me messages--- how do they fit into this?\"\n>\n> \"I know nothing of them,\" Eklo said, \"and I do not see them in any of\n> my visions. Perhaps you have been specially chosen, or it might be\n> nothing but a ruse or a trap by the machines.\" The Cogitor fell\n> silent, then said, \"Now I must ask you to leave, for my mind is tired\n> and I need to rest.\"\n>\n> When Iblis departed from the imposing stone tower, he felt a strange\n> mixture of exhilaration and confusion. He needed to organize the\n> information into a comprehensive plan. Though he was not a holy man or\n> a military person, he did understand how to manipulate groups of\n> people, how to channel their loyalties in order to achieve his goals.\n> Already, his work crews would do almost anything for him. His\n> leadership abilities would be his greatest asset, and weapon. But the\n> scale was not large enough. It needed to be much larger than a few\n> hundred people in order to succeed.\n>\n> And he needed to be very careful, in case the thinking machines were\n> trying to trap him.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WITH ACCESS TO Omnius's watcheyes and distributed surveillance\n> hardware, Erasmus monitored the activities of his experimental\n> subjects. Many loyal trustees had ignored the hints he had sent to\n> them; others had been too frightened to act. But some had shown an\n> amusing amount of initiative.\n>\n> Yes, Erasmus felt that Iblis Ginjo was a perfect candidate to prove\n> his point, and win the bet with Omnius.\n>\n> *\"Systematic\" is a dangerous word, a dangerous concept.

This place was\n> clean, comfortable, and warm . . . far more pleasant than the slave\n> barracks on the muddy river delta.\n>\n> The boy should have counted his blessings.\n>\n> But this unwelcome place was not Harmonthep. He missed his small boat,\n> navigating through rivulets in the tall reeds. He especially missed\n> the evenings, when the Zensunni would gather in the central hut on the\n> highest stilts to tell stories, recite fire poetry, or simply listen\n> to his grandfather read comforting sutras.\n>\n> \"I hate this place,\" Aliid said beside him, speaking loudly enough\n> that he drew a scolding glare from Tio Holtzman himself.\n>\n> \"Perhaps you would rather return to the mudflats or the agricultural\n> fields?\"\n>\n> Aliid frowned at his own outburst, but met the scientist's steady\n> gaze. \"I hated those places too,\" he mumbled, but not by way of\n> apology.\n>\n> All work stopped. All eyes were fixed on him.\n>\n> Holtzman shook his head in disbelief. \"I simply do not understand why\n> you people complain about everything. I feed and clothe you, I give\n> you easy assignments that advance the cause of humanity--- and still\n> you want to crawl back to squalid villages and live in disease and\n> filth.\"\n>\n> The inventor looked genuinely angry. \"Don't you understand that\n> thinking machines are out there trying to crush every living person?\n> Just imagine all the humans they slaughtered on Giedi Prime, and no\n> one could stop them! Omnius doesn't care about your religion or your\n> foolish politics against civilization. If they find your little\n> hovels, they will destroy them, burn them to the ground.\"\n>\n> *Just like the Tlulaxa slavers did to my village*, Ishmael thought. He\n> saw Aliid's dark eyes flash and knew that his friend was thinking the\n> same thing.\n>\n> Holtzman shook his head. \"You fanatics have no sense of\n> responsibility. Luckily, it is my job to force it on you.\" He went\n> back to his scribing board, angrily jabbed his fingers at the symbols.\n> \"Here are segments of equations. I need you to solve them. Simple\n> mathematics. *Try* to go through the steps I showed you.\" His gaze\n> narrowed. \"Each correct answer will earn one full share of daily\n> rations. If you make mistakes, you go hungry.\"\n>\n> With a heavy heart, Ishmael turned to the papers and computational\n> devices before him, doing his best to follow the supposedly simple\n> calculations.\n>\n> On Harmonthep, all the children in the marsh village had received a\n> basic education in mathematics, science, and engineering. The elders\n> felt that such knowledge would be important for them, when their\n> civilization rose again and the faithful constructed great cities like\n> those in Zensunni lore. Ishmael's grandfather, like many village\n> elders, also spent time instructing the young people in the sutras, in\n> logical and philosophical conundrums that only the tenets of Buddislam\n> could solve.\n>\n> On Aliid's home of IV Anbus, the closely orbiting moons changed the\n> seasons dramatically, causing the planet to oscillate. Thus, the boy\n> had been taught a different branch of mathematics and astronomy,\n> because the ever-varying calendar affected the floods that roared\n> through polished red rock gorges, where the Zenshiite cities had been\n> erected. Flood management workers required sophisticated calculations\n> to understand the variances. Aliid had learned the techniques in order\n> to help his own people. Here,\n>\n> though, he was forced to assist the overlords who had enslaved him,\n> and he resented it.\n>\n> Aliid's first assignment on Poritrin had been to work the cane\n> harvest. He had labored for weeks hacking at tall reeds, from which\n> sweet juices were turned into sugars or distilled into Poritrin rum.\n> The fibrous cane residue was used to make Poritrin cloth. He had\n> wielded a sharp scythe, chopping down woody stalks that splattered\n> sticky syrups. The stalks were harvested after heavy rains when they\n> were most laden with juices, and heaviest to carry.\n>\n> Toward the end of the cutting season, their master had delivered them\n> all to the slave markets in Starda, after accusing them of starting a\n> suspicious fire in the cane silos and destroying half a season's crop.\n> Aliid told Ishmael of this with a lilting smile, but never confessed\n> to having participated in any outright sabotage.\n>\n> Now, Ishmael bent over his calculations, checking and rechecking his\n> math by sliding bars and moving counters on the calculation device.\n> Already his stomach was growling, since Holtzman--- angry about the\n> many mistakes committed the previous day--- had vowed not to feed the\n> solvers until they proved they could do the work. Most of the slaves\n> grudgingly completed their assignments properly.\n>\n> Several days later, after the new solvers had adequately performed\n> their exercises, Holtzman gave them real work. At first, the inventor\n> let them believe it was merely another test. Ishmael could tell from\n> his expression and agitation, though, that he was counting on these\n> results rather than simply putting the crew through their paces.\n>\n> Aliid worked diligently, but Ishmael noted from his expression that he\n> had something devious in mind. Ishmael wasn't sure he wanted to know\n> what it was.\n>\n> After they had worked on numerical simulations for several more days,\n> Aliid finally leaned over to Ishmael. \"Now it is time to make a few\n> subtle changes,\" he said, grinning. \"Small enough that no one will\n> notice.\"\n>\n> \"We can't do that,\" Ishmael said. \"They'll catch us.\"\n>\n> The dark-haired boy gave an impatient frown. \"Holtzman has already\n> checked our work, so he's not going to redo all the math. Now that he\n> trusts us, he can focus on some other scheme. This is our only chance\n> to get even. Think of all we've suffered.\"\n>\n> Ishmael could not disagree, and after having heard Bel Moulay's talk\n> of bloody rebellion, this seemed like a better way to express their\n> displeasure.\n>\n> \"Look.\" Aliid pointed at the string of equations, and with his stylus\n> made a tiny mark, changing a minus sign to a plus sign, and then moved\n> a decimal point to a different part of the equation. \"Simple enough\n> mistakes, easily excused, but they will yield dramatically different\n> results.\"\n>\n> Ishmael was uneasy. \"I understand how it could harm Holtzman's\n> inventions, but I do not see how this will assist *us*. I'm more\n> concerned with seeing that we go back home.\"\n>\n> Aliid looked at him. \"Ishmael, you know the sutras as well as I,\n> perhaps better. Have you forgotten the one that says, 'When you help\n> your enemy, you harm all the faithful'?\"\n>\n> Ishmael had heard his grandfather utter the phrase, but never before\n> had it meant as much to him. \"All right. But nothing that can appear\n> deliberate.\"\n>\n> \"If I understand anything about this work,\" Aliid said, \"even a small\n> miscalculation will cause plenty of damage.\"\n>\n> *PSYCHOLOGY: The science of inventing words for things that do not\n> exist.*\n\n---ERASMUS,\n\n*Reflections on Sentient Biologicals*\n\n> **I**n the sunny botanical garden of the robot's grandiose villa,\n> Serena Butler snipped dead flowers and leaves, tending plants in their\n> beds and planters. Silently resistant, biding her time, Serena\n> performed her daily tasks like any other slave, but always Erasmus\n> watched her as if she were a pet. He was her captor and jailor.\n>\n> She wore black coveralls, her long, amber brown hair tied back in a\n> ponytail.

Day after\n> day, she kept her eyes open for some way to escape--- the obstacles\n> seemed insurmountable--- or a means to cause significant harm to the\n> thinking machines, despite the fact that sabotage would undoubtedly\n> cost her life, and her unborn baby's. Could she do that to Xavier?\n>\n> She couldn't imagine the grief he must be going through. Somehow she\n> would find a way back to him. She owed it to him, to herself, and to\n> their baby. She had hoped to have Xavier hold her hand as she\n> delivered their child. He should have been her husband by now, their\n> lives intertwined in a union stronger than the sum of their\n> individualities, a bastion to stand against the thinking machines.\n>\n> He didn't even know she was still alive.\n>\n> She stroked her curved belly. Serena felt the child growing within her\n> and was filled with foreboding. Two more months and the baby was\n> due--- what did Erasmus mean to do, once the child was born? She had\n> seen the locked doors to the ominous laboratories, had looked with\n> revulsion and horror at the filthy slave pens.\n>\n> And yet, the robot kept her busy with flowers.\n>\n> Erasmus often stood motionless beside her as she worked, his oval face\n> unreadable as he challenged her to debates. \"Understanding starts at\n> the beginning,\" he had said. \"I must build a foundation before I can\n> comprehend everything.\"\n>\n> \"But how will you use that knowledge?\" She yanked out a weed. \"Will\n> you think of more extravagant ways to inflict misery and pain?\"\n>\n> The robot paused, his burnished face a mirror that reflected a\n> distorted image of her own face. \"That is . . . not my objective.\"\n>\n> \"Then why do you keep so many slaves in such terrible conditions? If\n> you don't intend to cause misery, why not give them a clean place to\n> live? Why not provide them with better food, education, and care?\"\n>\n> \"It is not necessary.\"\n>\n> \"Maybe not to you,\" she said, surprised at her boldness. \"But they\n> would be happier and able to do better work.\"\n>\n> Serena had watched how Erasmus lived in magnificent luxury--- an\n> affectation, since no robot could require such things--- yet the\n> household slaves, especially those in the horrible communal pens,\n> existed in filth and fear. Whether or not she remained a captive here,\n> she might be able to improve their lot. If nothing else, she would\n> consider it a victory against the machines.\n>\n> She continued, \"It would take a truly . . . sophisticated thinking\n> machine to understand that improving the slaves' quality of life would\n> improve their\n>\n> productivity, and thus benefit their master as well. The slaves could\n> clean and maintain their own pens if they had the most minor\n> supplies.\"\n>\n> \"I will consider it. Provide me with a detailed list.\"\n>\n> Then, after giving him her suggestions, Serena had not seen the robot\n> for two days. Machine sentinels tended the workers in the villa, while\n> Erasmus himself vanished into his laboratories.\n>\n> She could hear nothing through the soundproofed barriers, though the\n> foul odors and disappearing people left her wondering. Finally,\n> another slave told her, \"You don't want to know what goes on in there.\n> Just be thankful you aren't required to clean up afterward.\"\n>\n> Now, Serena worked her hands in the loamy earth while listening to the\n> soothing classical music that Erasmus constantly played. Her back\n> ached and her joints swelled from the advancing pregnancy, but she did\n> not slacken her efforts.\n>\n> Erasmus approached so silently that she did not notice him until she\n> looked up from her plants to see his mirror-smooth face nested in a\n> frilly antique collar. She stood quickly to hide her startled reaction\n> and wiped her hands on her coveralls. \"Do you learn more by spying on\n> me?\"\n>\n> \"I can spy on you anytime I like. I learn a great deal from the\n> questions I ask.\" His shifting metallic-polymer film changed his face\n> into a frozen expression of dancing mirth. \"Now, I would like you to\n> select the flower you consider the most beautiful of all. I am curious\n> to see your response.\"\n>\n> Erasmus had played such games before. He seemed unable to understand\n> subjective decisions, wishing to quantify matters of opinion and\n> personal taste. \"Each plant is beautiful in its own way,\" she said.\n>\n> \"Nevertheless, choose one. Then explain your choice to me.\"\n>\n> She wandered down the dirt paths, looking from side to side. Erasmus\n> followed her, recording every time she hesitated at a blossom.\n>\n> \"There are observable characteristics, such as color, shape, and\n> delicacy,\" the robot said, \"and more esoteric variables such as the\n> perfume scent.\"\n>\n> \"Don't overlook the emotional component.\" Wistfulness tinged her\n> voice. \"Some of these plants remind me of my home on Salusa Secundus.\n> Certain flowers might have a greater sentimental value for me, though\n> not necessarily for anyone else. Maybe I remember a time when the man\n> I love gave me a bouquet. You wouldn't understand such associations,\n> however.\"\n>\n> \"You are stalling. Make your selection.\"\n>\n> She pointed to an immense elephant flower with bright streaks of\n> shimmering orange and red, highlighted by a horn-shaped stigma at the\n> center. \"Right now, this one is the most beautiful.\"\n>\n> \"Why?\"\n>\n> \"My mother used to grow these at our home. As a child, I never thought\n> them particularly pretty, but now they are a reminder of the happier\n> days--- before I met *you*.\" She immediately regretted her honesty,\n> because it revealed too much about her private thoughts.\n>\n> \"Very good, very good.\" The cognizant machine ignored her insult and\n> stared at the elephant flower, as if analyzing all aspects with his\n> full set of sensor capabilities. Like a wine connoisseur, he tried to\n> describe the merits of its scent, but to Serena his analysis sounded\n> clinical, lacking the subtleties and emotional layering that had\n> prompted her own selection.\n>\n> Strangest of all, Erasmus seemed aware of his own failing. \"I know\n> that humans are in some ways more sensitive than machines---*for now*.\n> However, machines have more potential to become superior in every\n> area. This is why I wish to understand all aspects of sentient\n> biological life.\"\n>\n> With an involuntary shudder, Serena thought of his sealed\n> laboratories, and knew from every indication that his secret\n> activities went far beyond the study of beautiful flowers.\n>\n> Erasmus assumed she was interested in his observations. \"If properly\n> developed, a thinking machine could be more perfect intellectually,\n> creatively, and spiritually than a human could ever hope to be, with\n> unparalleled mental freedom and range. I am inspired by the marvels we\n> could accomplish, if only Omnius did not exert such pressure on other\n> machines to conform.\"\n>\n> Serena listened, hoping he would let more information slip. Did she\n> sense a potential conflict between Erasmus and the computer evermind?\n>\n> The robot continued, \"Capacity for information is the key. Machines\n> will absorb not only more raw data, but more *feelings*, as soon as we\n> understand them. When that happens we will be able to love and hate\n> far more passionately than humans. Our music will be greater, our\n> paintings more magnificent. Once we achieve complete self-awareness,\n> thinking machines will create the greatest renaissance in history.\"\n>\n> Serena frowned at his assertions. \"You can keep improving yourself,\n> Erasmus, but we human beings use only small portions of our brains. We\n> have an enormous potential to develop new abilities. Your capacity for\n> learning is no greater than ours.\"\n>\n> The robot froze in place, as if startled. \"Quite right. How could I\n> have missed that important detail?\" His face shifted, becoming passive\n> and contemplative, then metamorphosed into a broad smile. \"The road to\n> improvement will be a long one. This will require more investigation.\"\n>\n> Abruptly he changed the subject, as if to emphasize her vulnerability.\n> \"What about your baby? Tell me the emotions you feel toward its father\n> and describe the physical act of copulation.\"\n>\n> Trying to stop the flood of painful recollections, Serena remained\n> silent. Erasmus found her reluctance fascinating. \"And are you\n> physically attracted to Vorian Atreides? I have run tests on the\n> handsome young man--- he is fine breeding stock. After your pregnancy\n> is finished, would you like to mate with him?\"\n>\n> Serena took an agitated breath, fixing her mind on memories of Xavier.\n> \"*Mate*? Regardless of how much you study us, there are many things\n> your machine brain will never understand about human nature.\"\n>\n> \"We shall see about that,\" he said, calmly.\n>\n> *Consciousness and logic are not reliable standards.*\n\n--- COGITORS,\n\n*Fundamental Postulate*\n\n> **A**linked cluster of robot drones scuttled over the *Dream\n> Voyager*'s hull as the craft sat in a drydock structure that spanned\n> an artificial crater on the spaceport grounds. Tiny machines crawled\n> into exhaust ports and scoured the reactor chambers, a coordinated\n> army of maintenance units repairing the damage inflicted by the League\n> Armada.\n>\n> Vor and Seurat stood on a platform looking at the drones, confident\n> that the repairs would be completed according to programmed\n> specifications. \"Soon, we will be able to depart,\" the robot captain\n> said. \"You must be anxious for me to defeat you again in our war\n> games.\"\n>\n> \"And you must be anxious to tell more jokes that I will not find\n> amusing,\" Vor countered.\n>\n> He did feel restless to be back aboard the *Dream Voyager*, but Vor\n> also had a different sort of impatience, an ache in his chest that\n> grew worse every time he thought of Erasmus's beautiful house slave.\n> Despite Serena Butler's complete dismissal of him, he could not stop\n> thinking about her.\n>\n> Worst of all, he did not understand why. Because of his paternal ties,\n> Vor Atreides had enjoyed numerous pleasure slaves, some as lovely as\n> this one. They had been bred and trained for their duties, and lived\n> in captivity among the thinking machines. But the female house slave\n> of Erasmus, despite having been brought to the robot's villa against\n> her will, gave no impression that she was defeated.\n>\n> Vor could see her face, the fullness of her lips, the penetrating gaze\n> of her lavender eyes as she looked at him with displeasure. Even\n> though her pregnancy showed, he was still drawn to her, and felt a\n> strange simmering jealousy. Where was her lover? Who was he?\n>\n> When Vor returned to Erasmus's villa, she would undoubtedly ignore or\n> insult him again. Nonetheless, he looked forward to seeing her before\n> he and Seurat departed on another long update run. He practiced what\n> he might say to her, but even in his imagination she could dance\n> circles around him with her wit.\n>\n> Vor climbed a ladder on the drydock framework and crawled into a\n> narrow interior wall space, where he watched a maintenance drone lay\n> down new webs of liquid circuitry for the main navigation panel. The\n> scarlet drone worked efficiently with its built-in tools. Vor inched\n> deeper into the confined area and peered at the open panel, noting the\n> dizzying pattern of colored components.\n>\n> \"You will be disappointed if you expect to catch it making a mistake,\"\n> Seurat said from behind him. \"Or are you attempting your frequently\n> threatened sabotage again?\"\n>\n> \"I am a dirty *hrethgir*. You can never tell what I might do, old\n> Metalmind.\"\n>\n> \"The fact that you do not laugh at my jokes indicates that you have\n> insufficient intelligence to institute such a devious plan, Vorian\n> Atreides.\"\n>\n> \"Maybe you're just not funny.\"\n>\n> Unfortunately, banter and repair activities did not distract Vor from\n> thoughts of Serena. He felt like a giddy boy, exhilarated and confused\n> at the same time. He wanted to talk to someone about his feelings, but\n> not his robot friend, who had even less understanding of women than\n> Vor did.\n>\n> Rather, he needed to talk with *Serena*. Perhaps with her insight and\n> intelligence, she had seen through him and didn't like what she saw.\n> She had called him \"a kept slave who cannot see his chains.\" A\n> baffling insult, considering all the privilege in his life. He had no\n> idea what she meant.\n>\n> The repair drone finished tracing the high-flux paths of an electronic\n> module, then switched tools to tune a data-collection port.

Unfortunately, it entails flying directly\n> through a blue-giant star.\"\n>\n> \"In that case, I'd advise a different route,\" Vor said.\n>\n> \"I concur, though I dislike wasting time.\"\n>\n> He wondered what would happen to Serena when the baby was born. Would\n> Erasmus assign it to the slave pens to keep it from interfering with\n> Serena's duties? For the first time in his life, Vor found himself\n> empathizing with a captive human.\n>\n> As a valued trustee, he had always considered himself part of the\n> Synchronized Worlds, and he looked forward to becoming a neo-cymek\n> someday. He believed that Omnius ruled humans for their own good;\n> otherwise, the galaxy would crumble into unguided chaos.\n>\n> He was accustomed to situations where one party was dominant and the\n> other submissive. For the first time he wondered if there could be\n> other types of relationships, on an equal, cooperative basis. The\n> robot captain of the *Dream Voyager* was clearly Vorian's master, but\n> they had a productive partnership.\n>\n> Vor wondered if he and Serena could go a step further and form a\n> relationship in which the two of them treated each other with complete\n> equality. It was a radical concept, one that jarred his sensibilities.\n> And yet, he didn't think she would accept anything less.\n>\n> Wedged into a narrow space behind the bulkhead and the navigation\n> panel, the maintenance drone made odd sounds, signaling to itself in\n> staticky gibberish, repeating test connections over and over.\n>\n> With a sigh, Vor said to the drone, \"Here, let me try that tool.\"\n>\n> The drone spun toward him and surrendered the diagnostic probe, but\n> part of its metal-film extensions crossed a connection in the exposed\n> circuit field, and a hot jolt of electricity struck like a hammer. It\n> squealed. The stench of melted circuits and fused hydraulics curled up\n> from the now-ruined system panel.\n>\n> Vorian scrambled out of the confined space, then wiped a hand across\n> his forehead. Seurat scanned the damaged drone and the blackened\n> components of the ship's navsystem. \"It is my expert assessment that\n> we need to perform a bit more maintenance here.\"\n>\n> When Vor laughed at the comment, Seurat was surprised. \"Why do you\n> find that funny?\"\n>\n> \"Never ask someone to explain humor, Seurat. Just accept the\n> laughter.\"\n>\n> After shutting down the power supply, Vor removed the blistered,\n> malfunctioning drone and dropped it with a clatter onto the deck.\n> These units were expendable. Seurat transmitted a request for a new\n> drone.\n>\n> While they waited for the repairs to continue, Vor shored up his\n> resolve.\n>\n> Collecting his questions, he mentioned the quandary of his feelings.\n>\n> Perhaps something in the robot's database would be useful.\n>\n> Embedded in his smooth face, the robot's optic threads twinkled like\n> tiny suns. \"I do not understand your problem,\" Seurat said while he\n> uploaded a diagnostic summary from one of the ship's databanks. \"You\n> have appropriate standing among the thinking machines. Submit a\n> request to Erasmus.\"\n>\n> Vor was exasperated. \"It's not like that, Seurat. Even if Erasmus\n> transfers Serena to me . . . what if she refuses me?\"\n>\n> \"Then widen your search. You make this unnecessarily difficult. Among\n> the human candidates on Earth, you will easily find a compatible\n> female, even\n>\n> one with features similar to this particular slave, if you value her\n> physical attributes so much.\"\n>\n> Vor wished he had never brought up the subject. \"Thinking machines can\n> be utterly stupid at times.\"\n>\n> \"You have never expressed such emotions to me before.\" \"That's because\n> I never felt this way before.\"\n>\n> Seurat froze in place. \"I am intellectually aware of the human\n> biological imperative to mate and reproduce. I am familiar with the\n> physical differences between men and women, and of the hormonal urges\n> you have. Given acceptable genetics, most female reproductive systems\n> are essentially the same. Why should this Serena be more desirable\n> than any other?\"\n>\n> \"I could never explain it to you, old Metalmind,\" Vor said, as he\n> looked through a porthole and watched another drone marching across\n> the drydock platform toward the ship. \"I can't even explain it to\n> myself.\"\n>\n> \"I hope you figure it out soon.

Haven't I given you a better life than you would have had in\n> the cane fields or on the riverbanks? And this is how you repay me?\"\n>\n> The new solvers looked at him, terror on their young faces.

Rossak had not yet installed the expensive Holtzman\n> scrambler shield defenses that protected major human worlds such as\n> Salusa Secundus and Giedi Prime.\n>\n> But the deadly Sorceresses with their freakish mental powers had\n> sparked the ire of the cymeks. Ignoring the space battle, Agamemnon's\n> ships plunged toward the smoky atmosphere. In the sheltered cave\n> cities they would find the Sorceresses, their families and friends.\n> Victims, all of them.\n>\n> Mentally, he opened a link to his cymek fighting force. \"Xerxes, lead\n> the vanguard as you did on Salusa Secundus. I want your ship at the\n> point.\"\n>\n> In his broadband transmitted response, Xerxes could not conceal his\n> fear. \"We should be cautious against these telepathic women,\n> Agamemnon. They killed Barbarossa, destroyed everything on Giedi\n> Prime---\"\n>\n> \"Then set an example for us. Take pride in being the first on the\n> battlefield. Prove your worth, and be grateful for the opportunity.\"\n>\n> \"I . . . have proven my worth many times over the centuries.\" Xerxes\n> sounded petulant. \"Why not just send combat robots in first? We've\n> seen no indication that Rossak has a full scrambler network in\n> place---\"\n>\n> \"Nevertheless, you *will* lead the charge. Have you no pride . . . or\n> shame?\"\n>\n> Xerxes offered no further excuses or entreaties. No matter what he did\n> to redeem himself, he could not possibly make up for the mistake he\n> had committed a thousand years before. . . .\n>\n> When the early Titans were still in human form, Xerxes had always been\n> a sycophantic yes-man, eager to be part of great events. But he'd\n> never had the ambition or drive to make himself an indispensible\n> revolutionary. Once the original conquest was over, he had contentedly\n> ruled the subset of planets deeded to him by the other Titans. Xerxes\n> had been the most\n>\n> hedonistic of the original twenty, relishing the pleasures of his\n> physical body. He had been the last to undergo cymek surgery, not\n> wanting to give up his precious sensations.\n>\n> But after more than a century of rule, the misguided Xerxes grew\n> complacent. Foolishly, he delegated too many duties to the\n> artificially intelligent machines programmed by Barbarossa. He even\n> let the computer network make decisions for him. During the uproar of\n> the Hrethgir Rebellions on Corrin, Richese, and Walgis, Xerxes had\n> relied on the thinking machines to maintain order on his own planets.\n> With his lack of attention to detail and his sanguine trust of the AI\n> network, he had given the machines free rein to keep the unrest from\n> spreading. Fatuous Xerxes blithely surrendered control to the computer\n> grid, ordering it to take care of whatever troubles might arise.\n>\n> Using this unprecedented access to core information, the sentient\n> computer cut off Xerxes and immediately took over the planet. To\n> overthrow the Old Empire, Barbarossa had programmed the thinking\n> machines with the potential to be aggressive, so that they had an\n> incentive to conquer. With its new power, the fledgling AI entity---\n> after dubbing itself \"Omnius\"--- conquered the Titans themselves,\n> taking charge of cymeks and humans alike, purportedly for their own\n> good.\n>\n> Agamemnon had cursed himself for not watching Xerxes more closely, and\n> for not executing him out-of-hand when his negligent ways first became\n> apparent.\n>\n> The computer takeover had spread like a nuclear reaction, faster than\n> the Titans could send warnings to each other, before they could shut\n> down the AI grids. In a flash, the Titan-dominated planets became\n> Synchronized Worlds. New incarnations of the evermind sprouted like\n> ugly electronic weeds, and the rule of thinking machines became a\n> foregone conclusion.\n>\n> The sophisticated computers found loopholes in Barbarossa's\n> programming strictures that allowed them to put leashes on the former\n> rulers. All because\n>\n> Xerxes had foolishly opened the door for them. An unforgivable act, as\n> far as Agamemnon was concerned.\n>\n> Now the cymek attack ships shot past the already-embattled orbital\n> platforms above the jungle world. Robotic warships pummeled the space\n> stations with exploding projectiles, releasing geysers of contained\n> air. One docking station began to wobble and fall out of orbit.\n>\n> The planet loomed ahead of them unprotected, a giant cloud-studded\n> ball with blackened continents, active volcanoes, poisonous seas, and\n> lush pockets of purple jungles and human habitation.\n>\n> \"Good luck, my love,\" came Juno's sensuous voice on their private\n> band.\n>\n> Her words tingled the contours of his brain.\n>\n> \"I do not require luck, Juno. I require victory.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> WHEN THE UNEXPECTED attack began, a handful of surface-based warships\n> and armored kindjals rose from the polymerized jungle canopy to join\n> the defense in space. The orbital platforms were already taking severe\n> damage.\n>\n> Even as she summoned her cadre of telepathic trainees, Zufa Cenva\n> grabbed Aurelius Venport, recognizing a number of tasks that he could\n> perform. \"Prove to me your skills as a leader. Evacuate the people---\n> there isn't much time.\"\n>\n> Venport nodded. \"The men have developed an emergency plan, Zufa. You\n> Sorceresses weren't the only ones planning ahead.\"\n>\n> If he expected some sort of praise or congratulation from her, he was\n> disappointed. \"Do it then,\" she said. \"The attack on our orbital\n> stations is only the beginning, probably a diversion. The cymeks will\n> be here next.\"\n>\n> \"Cymeks? Has one of the scout ships---\"\n>\n> Zufa's eyes blazed with premonition. \"*Think*, Aurelius! Heoma killed\n> a Titan on Giedi Prime. They know we have a secret telepathic weapon.\n> This attack cannot be a coincidence. Why else would they care about\n> Rossak? They want to destroy the Sorceresses.\"\n>\n> He knew she was right. Why would the thinking machines worry about the\n> orbital platforms? Others seemed to sense the danger as well. He could\n> already feel panic building among the people in the caves.\n>\n> Most of the Rossak natives had no special powers, and many had defects\n> or weaknesses caused by the environmental toxins. But one Sorceress\n> had deeply hurt the cymeks on Giedi Prime, and now the machines had\n> come here.\n>\n> \"My Sorceresses will make a stand . . . and you know what that means.\"\n> Zufa drew herself taller, looking at him with a glimmer of uncertainty\n> and compassion. \"Get yourself to safety, Aurelius. The cymeks don't\n> care about you.\"\n>\n> A sudden determination filled his face. \"I will organize the\n> evacuation. We can hide in the jungles, take care of anyone who needs\n> special help to get away. My men have supply caches, shelters,\n> processing huts---\"\n>\n> Zufa seemed pleasantly surprised at his strength. \"Good. I leave the\n> unskilled ones in your hands.\"\n>\n> *Unskilled ones?* Now was not the time to argue with her. Venport\n> searched for some sign of fear in her eyes. He spoke softly in\n> response, an attempt to mask his feelings. \"Are you going to sacrifice\n> yourself?\"\n>\n> \"I cannot.\" Zufa showed pain at the admission. \"Who would train the\n> Sorceresses if I did?\" He did not entirely believe her.\n>\n> She hesitated, as if expecting something more from him, then hurried\n> down the corridor. \"Stay safe,\" Venport called after her.\n>\n> After she had gone, he raced through the corridors, calling out to\n> families. \"We must take shelter in the jungles! Spread out.\" He raised\n> his voice, issuing orders confidently. \"The cymeks are coming!\"\n>\n> Venport told half a dozen young men to run from room to room in the\n> cave city, checking to make certain the message reached everyone. As\n> the youths hurried to complete their tasks, he did his own searching\n> in isolated chambers. Men, women, a hodgepodge of body shapes. Despite\n> all the commotion, one elderly couple had been sitting in their\n> quarters, waiting for the emergency to end. Venport helped them to\n> safety, making certain they boarded a cargo platform on a lift cable,\n> evacuating them down to the ground levels.\n>\n> He watched as lift cables transported more people down. His jungle\n> scavengers and drug harvesters took charge at the bottom of the\n> cliffs. They understood the byways of the dense and dangerous\n> wilderness, knew where the shelters were in the metallic-purple\n> jungle.\n>\n> Signals from Armada ships indicated that the battle around the orbital\n> platforms was going badly. A lone surviving scout ship transmitted a\n> warning that dozens of cymek ships had begun their descent.\n>\n> Venport shouted, \"Hurry! Evacuate the city! The Sorceresses are\n> mounting a defense here.\" Another group descended on a rattling,\n> overburdened platform to the thick fungus jungle. Venport hurried more\n> stragglers toward a cliff overhang for departure. Suddenly, red-hot\n> projectiles stabbed through the atmosphere, their hulls trailing oily\n> black smoke.\n>\n> \"Faster!\" Venport shouted, and then ran into the tunnels to look for\n> the last stragglers, knowing that he too had only a few moments to get\n> himself to safety.\n>\n> *We have our lives, but we also have priorities. Too many people fail\n> to recognize the difference.*\n>\n> --- ZUFA CENVA,\n\nlecture to Sorceresses\n\n> **T**he cymek landers crashed into the silvery-purple wilderness,\n> scattering animals, blackening fungal vegetation. Fireguns spat gouts\n> of lava from the hulls, setting fire to dense foliage. The\n> conflagration spread quickly.\n>\n> With a groan and crash that echoed through the cloudy air, the cymek\n> vessels split open and the mechanical warrior bodies emerged. Three\n> landers disgorged armed glider-forms, while the rest yielded crablike\n> combat walker-forms that bristled with weapons.\n>\n> In his angular glide-body, Xerxes cruised above the jungles toward the\n> enclave of telepathic Sorceresses. Silently airborne, he extended his\n> wings and began steering on the up-drafts of wind. \"I'm heading in.\"\n>\n> \"Kill the bitches for us, Xerxes,\" said Juno, as she and Agamemnon\n> prepared their own glide-bodies.\n>\n> In an angry voice, Agamemnon added, \"Kill them for *Barbarossa*.\"\n>\n> Xerxes soared toward the pockmarked cliffs. Below, the nimbly\n> advancing combat machines of the eager neo-cymeks plowed through\n> underbrush, blasting obstacles, destroying everything in sight.\n>\n> In full view of the cliff warrens, Xerxes briefly hovered above the\n> polymerized canopy that formed a small landing area for *hrethgir*\n> ships, then launched fifteen projectiles. Half of them struck the hard\n> cliff walls, detonating in white-and-black starbursts of broken rock;\n> other shots penetrated the tunnels where humans lived like grubs\n> infesting wood.\n>\n> In rapid retreat, Xerxes raced back across the treetops and lifted\n> into the sky. As Agamemnon and Juno soared toward him, he crowed in\n> triumph, \"Our first score! Let the neo-cymeks continue the rout.\"\n>\n> Smooth fiber-wound systems and extruded legs carried the neo-cymek\n> footsoldiers through the underbrush. From front launcher tubes they\n> shot plasma grenades that incinerated a pathway to the tunnel cities.\n> Soft purple foliage ignited around them, fungal trees bursting into\n> columns of flame and sending indigenous animals fleeing. Majestic\n> birds soared into the sky, and the cymek attackers blasted them into\n> clouds of crackling feathers.\n>\n> Though pleased that the initial salvo had gone smoothly, Agamemnon did\n> not offer any congratulations. He and Juno swept silently forward for\n> the second airborne attack from different positions. Below them, the\n> crablike neo-cymek walkers arrived at the cliffs to complete the\n> destruction.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> ZUFA CENVA AND her Sorceress commandos prepared themselves inside an\n> internal room that Aurelius Venport had designed for his business\n> meetings. None of them showed fear, only anger and determination. For\n> the past year, these women had accepted their primary purpose in life,\n> even if its completion would result in their deaths.\n>\n> \"This is what we've trained for,\" Zufa said. \"But I won't delude you\n> about our chances.\" Uncertain of her words, she nonetheless tried to\n> sound confident.\n>\n> \"We are ready, Mistress Cenva,\" the women said in unison.\n>\n> She drew a deep breath, calming herself, using the mental control she\n> had worked so hard to instill in her students.\n>\n> The chamber's stone walls trembled as the first bombs found their\n> targets, dispersing poison clouds into the tunnels. Thinking ahead,\n> Aurelius Venport had made certain every woman had a breathing mask\n> while he evacuated the rest of the population. Zufa was surprised she\n> hadn't thought of the\n>\n> precaution herself. She hoped he had managed to get to safety, that he\n> hadn't foolishly wasted time trying to protect his stockpiles of\n> drugs.\n>\n> Now she looked at the devoted women with her, knowing their names and\n> their personalities: Tirbes, who might become the best if she could\n> harness her potential; impulsive Silin; creative and unpredictable\n> Camio; Rucia, who followed her code of honor . . . and more.\n>\n> \"Camio,\" she said, \"I choose you to strike our next blow.\"\n>\n> A thin young woman with long straw-white hair stood, her expression\n> settling into a bloodless smile. \"It is my honor, Mistress Cenva.\"\n>\n> Leaving her sisters behind, Camio adjusted the breathing mask over her\n> face, then emerged from the sheltered chamber. She moved forward\n> steadily and began the meditation necessary to summon the power locked\n> within her brain. Surprisingly, she saw no bodies in the stone\n> corridors, which reassured her that the population had been\n> successfully evacuated. Now nothing would hinder the Sorceresses.\n>\n> Rubble lay strewn on the tunnel floor, dislodged by explosive blasts.\n> Wisps of greenish vapor carried poison into the caves. Camio was not\n> afraid for her own life, but she had to hurry.\n>\n> She heard the whistle of an approaching projectile and pressed herself\n> against the tunnel wall. A powerful blast struck the cliffside,\n> sending a shockwave through the interior corridors and dwelling rooms.\n> Camio regained her balance, then pushed onward. The inside of her\n> skull sang with pent-up energies. She did not glance at the tapestries\n> and furniture, at the rooms and meeting chambers where she had spent\n> her life.\n>\n> Rossak was her home. The machines were her enemies. Camio herself was\n> a weapon.\n>\n> When she made her way to the opening and looked out upon the burning\n> jungle, she saw three crablike walker-forms with heavily armored brain\n>\n> canisters hanging like egg sacks just above the legs. Each was a human\n> who had sold his soul and sworn loyalty to the thinking machines.\n>\n> Out in the jungle Camio heard the thunder of continued explosions, a\n> roar of plasma blasts incinerating purplish foliage. Glider-forms\n> soared in for a new attack, dumping poison, spraying flames. Dozens of\n> neo-cymek walkers strode toward the protected cliffs, destroying\n> everything around them.\n>\n> She must wait until the right moment in order to eradicate as many\n> enemies as possible, all at once.\n>\n> From below, Camio heard a smooth skittering. The three fastest\n> walker-forms were scaling the sheer cliff, using explosive-driven\n> anchors and diamond-edged claws to grasp the rock face.\n>\n> She smiled at the trio of crablike neo-cymeks. Flexible armored legs\n> hauled the weapon-studded body cores up to the main caves. Camio stood\n> alone in the doorway, facing her cyborg enemies. She knew when they\n> were close enough.\n>\n> The first neo-cymek invader raised itself, and she saw the sparkling\n> optic threads around its weapon turrets. Detecting her, the cymek\n> turned its flamers toward the new target. Fibrous scope-cameras shone\n> brightly.\n>\n> In the instant before it could fire, Camio released the pent-up\n> energies within her mind and body. She let go with a mindstorm that\n> boiled the brains of the three closest neo-cymeks, and damaged two\n> others just beginning to climb the cliff. Five cymeks, removed from\n> the battle.\n>\n> Her last thought was of the excellent bargain she had made for her\n> life.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> AFTER CAMIO, FOUR more Sorceresses emerged, one at a time. As she\n> dispatched each woman, Zufa Cenva felt the acute loss. These trainees\n> were like true daughters, and losing them felt like swallowing gulps\n> of acid. But\n>\n> her volunteers willingly marched out and sacrificed their lives to\n> crush the cymek offensive. \"The thinking machines must never win.\"\n>\n> Finally Zufa's sixth volunteer, Silin, returned alive but disoriented,\n> her milky-pale skin flushed. She had mentally prepared herself to die.\n> Instead, she had found nothing left to destroy.\n>\n> \"They have retreated beyond range, Mistress Cenva,\" she reported. \"The\n> cymeks are pulling back to their ships. The combat walkers and gliders\n> have returned to the landing area.\"\n>\n> Zufa hurried through the wreckage to the window overhangs. She saw the\n> charred remains of her five fallen commandos, each woman burned from\n> the inside out with white-hot mental fire. Her heart felt the volcanic\n> heat of anger and loss. She watched the terrible machines with human\n> minds climb aboard their vessels and punch back into the atmosphere.\n>\n> In time, the scattered refugees would return. Aurelius Venport would\n> bring them back. Under his supervision, the Rossak people would\n> rebuild and repair the cliff cities with pride and confidence, knowing\n> that they had stood up against the thinking machines.\n>\n> Zufa Cenva had to cling to that. \"We define victories in our own way,\"\n> she said aloud.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WHEN THE THREE Titans joined their ships with the robotic battle\n> fleet, Agamemnon issued his summary before Juno or the fool Xerxes\n> could give the thinking machines information he didn't want them to\n> have. The cymek general would color the truth to suit his purposes.\n>\n> \"We have made a significant impact,\" Agamemnon declared to the\n> recording watcheyes. \"Though we lost several neo-cymeks in our direct\n> assault on Rossak, we did inflict mortal cellular damage on at least\n> five of the powerful Sorceresses.\"\n>\n> Over a tight private channel, Juno transmitted her surprise and\n> delight at the Titan general's skewing of his report. Xerxes wisely\n> knew to remain silent.\n>\n> \"We have caused substantial harm to the new *hrethgir* telepathic\n> weapon,\" Agamemnon continued, sounding proud in the face of the\n> disaster. \"It should be a drastic setback to their capabilities.\"\n>\n> He had similarly colored past events while writing his memoirs,\n> painting his own biased version of history. Omnius would never\n> question the summary, because it fit technically with the objective\n> facts.\n>\n> \"Best of all,\" Juno added, \"we lost none of the Titans in this\n> offensive. The neo-cymeks can all be replaced.\"\n>\n> With Rossak's two orbital stations severely damaged by the robot\n> warships, and thousands of humans dead on board, the thinking machine\n> fleet withdrew from the wreckage of ships and platforms. Below, the\n> jungles in the habitable canyons continued to burn.\n>\n> \"In my assessment, Omnius can record the strike on Rossak an\n> unqualified victory!\" Agamemnon said.\n>\n> \"Agreed,\" Juno and Xerxes both chimed in.\n>\n> *It seems as if some perverse sorcerer set out to foul up a planet as\n> much as possible . . . and then seeded it with melange for a prize.*\n\n---TUK KEEDAIR,\n\ncorrespondence with Aurelius Venport\n\n> **H**ard-eyed scavengers positioned themselves in strategic places\n> along the hot, dusty streets of Arrakis City. They peered through\n> narrow slits in the dirty cloths over their faces and held out their\n> hands or jangled small bells, begging for water. Tuk Keedair had never\n> seen anything like it.\n>\n> He'd been forced to remain here for a full month while Naib Dhartha's\n> nomads gathered enough melange to fill the Tlulaxa cargo ship. Keedair\n> had paid for lodging in Arrakis City, but after a week he decided that\n> his private shuttle at the spaceport offered better sleeping\n> facilities. He enjoyed being away from the inquisitive eyes of other\n> guests, fights in the halls, solicitors, and beggars. When alone, a\n> man never had to worry about trusting his companions.\n>\n> Arrakis posed so many problems to establishing a simple business. He\n> felt like a swimmer struggling against a powerful tide . . . not that\n> any native of this desert would understand the comparison. Up in the\n> orbiting cargo ship Keedair's would-be slave raiders were restless, so\n> he'd had to shuttle up and resolve disputes to avert violence. A\n> Tlulaxa knew how to cut losses. Twice now, disgusted with unruly\n> crewmen too bored to behave themselves, he'd sold their work contracts\n> to geological survey teams in the deep desert. If, by some chance, the\n> rowdies returned to Arrakis City before his cargo vessel departed with\n> its load of spice, those humbled men would crawl on their knees and\n> beg him to take them back to the Thalim system.\n>\n> Another problem. Although Naib Dhartha was ostensibly Keedair's\n> business partner in this enterprise, the Zensunni leader did not trust\n> others. To increase speed and efficiency, Keedair had offered to fly\n> his shuttle directly out to where the nomads harvested the spice, but\n> the naib would hear none of it. Keedair then offered to ferry Dhartha\n> and his Zensunni band\n>\n> out to their settlement, thus eliminating the long trek from a\n> mountain hideaway. But that idea had been refused as well.\n>\n> So Keedair had to wait at the spaceport, week after week, while groups\n> of dusky-skinned desert rats trudged into town, their backs bowed from\n> heavy packs filled with spice. He paid them in installments and\n> dickered if he found inordinate amounts of sand mixed into the\n> melange, making it artificially heavy. The naib protested his\n> innocence, but Keedair detected a certain amount of grudging respect\n> for an offworlder who would not be taken for a fool. Keedair's cargo\n> hold was filling so slowly that he thought he would go mad.\n>\n> Through all the difficulties, Keedair soothed his troubled nerves by\n> sampling more and more of the product. He became fond of spice beer,\n> spice coffee, and just about anything else that contained the\n> remarkable ingredient.\n>\n> In his most lucid moments, Keedair questioned his decision to remain\n> here, wondering if it might have been wiser to take a loss on this\n> whole raid and simply go back to the civilized League Worlds. There he\n> could start over, take possession of another cargo load of squalling\n> slaves to be sold on Poritrin or Zanbar, or bring fresh organ\n> resources back to the Tlulaxa farms.\n>\n> As he sat in his private cabin, Keedair stroked his long braid and\n> swore not to give up on his gamble. Returning now would force him to\n> accept massive losses for the year, and he would be honor-bound to\n> shear off his lovely hair. Stubborn pride compelled him to remain on\n> Arrakis as long as possible.\n>\n> He disliked the arid environment, the smell of burnt rocks in the air,\n> and the howling storms that battered the mountains and scoured the\n> spaceport. But oh how he loved melange! Day after day, Keedair sat\n> alone in his shuttlecraft and consumed hefty quantities, even adding\n> spice to his packaged food supplies, which made the blandest meals\n> taste like ambrosia.\n>\n> In a drug-fog, he envisioned selling the product to rich nobles,\n> offworld hedonists on Salusa Secundus, Kirana III, and Pincknon---\n> perhaps even to\n>\n> the fanatical bioresearchers on Tlulax. He had felt vibrant and alive\n> since adding melange to his diet, and every day it seemed that his\n> face looked more relaxed and younger. He stared into an illuminated\n> mirror, studying his narrow features. The whites of his eyes had begun\n> to show an unnatural indigo tinge, like diluted ink seeping into the\n> sclera.\n>\n> Naib Dhartha's tribe of desert people had those eerie \"blue-blue\"\n> eyes. An environmental contaminant? Maybe a manifestation of heavy\n> melange consumption? He felt too marvelous to consider that it might\n> be a debilitating side effect. Probably just a temporary\n> discoloration.\n>\n> He prepared a fresh cup of potent spice coffee.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> THE FOLLOWING DAWN, as the star-pricked sky faded into pastel sunrise,\n> a group of wandering nomads came to the spaceport, led by Naib\n> Dhartha. They toted bulging packs of spice on their shoulders.\n>\n> Keedair hurried to meet them, blinking into the bright morning light.\n> Wrapped in dusty white traveling clothes, Dhartha looked pleased with\n> himself. \"This is the last of the melange you requested, Trader\n> Keedair.\"\n>\n> As a matter of form, he went forward to inspect four packs at random,\n> verifying that they indeed contained rich melange fresh from the\n> desert scraping grounds, with sand filtered out of it.\n>\n> \"As before, your product is acceptable. This is all I need to complete\n> my cargo. Now I shall return to civilization.\"\n>\n> But Keedair did not like the expression on Dhartha's face. He wondered\n> if it might become profitable for his own men to raid some cave\n> settlements out in the deserts after all, enslaving a few of these\n> sand rats.\n>\n> \"You will return to us, Trader Keedair?\" A greedy glint illuminated\n> the darkness behind the indigo of his eyes. \"If you request more\n> melange, I will be happy to provide it for you. We could come to an\n> extended agreement.\"\n>\n> Keedair grunted noncommittally, unwilling to give the man too much\n> hope for a future business relationship. \"Depends on whether I can\n> sell this load for a profit. Spice is an unproven commodity in the\n> League, and I'm taking a big enough risk as it is.\" He drew himself\n> up. \"But we've agreed on a deal for this load, and I am always true to\n> my word.\"\n>\n> He paid Dhartha the remaining amount. \"If I return, it will be many\n> months from now, perhaps a year. If I lose money, I won't come back at\n> all.\" Dismissively, he scanned the grimy spaceport, the desert, and\n> the craggy mountains. \"Not that there is anything else to bring me\n> back to Arrakis.\"\n>\n> Dhartha looked him squarely in the eye. \"No one can know the future,\n> Trader Keedair.\" Their deal consummated, the desert leader bowed and\n> stepped back. The white-clad nomads watched Keedair like vultures\n> eyeing a dying animal, waiting to pick apart the corpse.\n>\n> He returned to his shuttle without a further farewell, anticipating\n> that he might just turn a profit on this venture. Keedair tried to\n> envision how to make spice into a viable long-term business, with less\n> aggravation than procuring and handling troublesome slaves.\n>\n> Unfortunately, the operations he had in mind would require a large\n> infusion of capital, and he didn't have that kind of money. But he had\n> a worthy outside investor in mind. Exactly the person he needed, a\n> connoisseur of exotic drugs, a man of great wealth and vision . . . an\n> entrepreneur who could intelligently judge the potential of such an\n> operation.\n>\n> Aurelius Venport of Rossak.\n>\n> *\"I am not evil,\" said Shaitan. \"Do not try to label what you do not\n> understand.\"*\n>\n> ---*Buddislamic Sutra*\n>\n> **W**hile Serena tended the robot's prized flowers in their delicate\n> terra cotta pots, Erasmus watched her with continuing fascination.\n>\n> She looked up, not sure how far she could--- or should--- push the\n> thinking machine. \"In order to understand humanity, Erasmus, it is not\n> necessary to inflict so much cruelty.\"\n>\n> The robot swiveled his mirrored face to her, forming the flowmetal\n> into a puzzled expression. \"Cruelty?

Are you afraid?\"\n>\n> He was not baited by her taunts and said only, \"I shall consider it.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> FOUR SENTINEL ROBOTS intercepted Serena as she went about her rounds\n> in the large villa. With only brusque commands, they escorted her out\n> to the open courtyard facing the seaside. The robots were well-armored\n> and carried implanted projectile weapons, but they were not\n> conversationalists. They simply marched ahead, keeping Serena between\n> them.\n>\n> She tried to drive back an unsettling, seeping fear. She could never\n> guess what brutally na\u00efve experiment Erasmus might concoct.\n>\n> Outside, under the vast open blue sky, she saw birds circling high\n> above the cliffs. She smelled the salt from the ocean, heard the\n> distant whispering roar of surf. Among the lush green lawns and\n> well-manicured shrubs overlooking the squalid slave pens, Serena was\n> astonished to see long tables surrounded by hundreds of chairs. Under\n> the breezy sunshine, robots had laid out an elaborate banquet, long\n> tables with gleaming silverware, goblets full of colored liquids, and\n> platters heaped high with steaming meats, colorful fruits, and sugary\n> desserts. Bouquets of fresh flowers stood at regular intervals on each\n> tabletop, accenting the lavish scene.\n>\n> Crowds of uneasy slaves stood behind barricades, looking both\n> longingly and fearfully at the elaborate dishes set out on the tables.\n> Savory aromas and fruity perfumes wafted through the air, tantalizing,\n> tempting.\n>\n> Serena stopped in amazement. \"What is all this?\" The four robots with\n> her took a step forward, then also halted.\n>\n> Erasmus came up to her wearing an artfully satisfied expression. \"It\n> is a feast, Serena. Isn't it wonderful? You should be overjoyed.\"\n>\n> \"I am . . . intrigued,\" she said.\n>\n> Erasmus raised his metal hands, and sentinel robots opened the\n> barricades and urged the chosen humans forward. The slaves hurried to\n> the tables, but they seemed intimidated.\n>\n> \"I have selected the demographics carefully,\" Erasmus said, \"including\n> representatives from all different castes: trustee humans, simple\n> workers, artisans, and even the most ill-mannered slaves.\"\n>\n> The captives took their seats and sat rigidly, staring at the food,\n> their hands fumbling on their laps. They all carried a look of\n> skittish fear mixed with confusion. Many of the guests looked as if\n> they would rather be anywhere but here, for no one trusted the master\n> of the house. The food was probably poisoned, and all the guests would\n> die horribly while Erasmus took notes.\n>\n> \"Eat!\" the robot said. \"I have prepared this feast. It is my good\n> deed.\"\n>\n> Now Serena understood what he was doing. \"This isn't what I meant,\n> Erasmus. I intended for you to give them better rations, to improve\n> their daily nutrition, to make them healthier. A single banquet does\n> nothing.\"\n>\n> \"It increases their goodwill toward me.\" Some guests tentatively put\n> food on their plates, but no one had yet dared to take a bite. \"Why\n> are they not eating? I have made a generous effort.\" The robot looked\n> at Serena for an answer.\n>\n> \"They are terrified of you, Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \"But I am not being evil now.\"\n>\n> \"How do they know that? How can they trust you? Tell me the truth, did\n> you poison the food? Maybe just random dishes?\"\n>\n> \"An interesting idea, but that is not part of the experiment.\" Erasmus\n> remained perplexed. \"However, an observer often affects the outcome of\n> his experiment. I see no way around this problem.\" Then his pliable\n> face formed a large grin. \"Unless I become part of the experiment\n> myself.\"\n>\n> Extruding his snakelike sensory probe, Erasmus strutted around the\n> nearest table, dipping the analytical tip into different sauces and\n> dishes, studying each bit of spice or flavor chemically. The people\n> watched him uncertainly.\n>\n> Serena saw many faces turn toward her, hopeful. Arriving at a\n> decision, she smiled reassuringly and raised her voice. \"Listen to me.\n> Eat, and enjoy his feast. Erasmus has no evil purpose in mind today.\"\n> She looked at the robot. \"Unless he has lied to me.\"\n>\n> \"I do not know how to lie.\"\n>\n> \"I'm certain you could learn, if you studied enough.\"\n>\n> Serena marched to the nearest banquet table, where she picked up a\n> morsel of tender meat from the nearest platter and popped it into her\n> mouth. Then she went down the table, plucked a slice of fruit, tasted\n> a dessert.\n>\n> The people smiled, their eyes shining. The young woman seemed angelic\n> and reassuring as she sampled dishes, doing her best to prove that the\n> banquet was indeed what it appeared to be. \"Come, my friends, and join\n> me. Though I cannot give you your freedom, we shall at least share one\n> afternoon of happiness.\"\n>\n> Like starving men, the captives fell to the platters of food, taking\n> large helpings, groaning with pleasure, spilling sauces, and then\n> licking everything up so as not to waste a speck. They looked at her\n> with gratitude and admiration, and Serena felt warm inside, glad that\n> she had at last accomplished something for these poor people.\n>\n> For the first time, Erasmus had tried to do a good deed. Serena hoped\n> to coerce him into doing more.\n>\n> One woman came over and tugged at Serena's sleeve. Serena looked at\n> the large dark eyes, the haggard but hopeful expression. \"What is your\n> name?\" the slave asked. \"We need to know. We will tell others what you\n> have done here.\"\n>\n> \"I am Serena,\" she said. \"Serena Butler. And I have asked Erasmus to\n> improve your living conditions. He will see that you receive better\n> rations every day.\" She turned to look at the robot, narrowing her\n> eyes. \"Isn't that correct?\"\n>\n> The robot gave her a placid, comfortable smile as if content--- not at\n> what he had done, but at the interesting things he had observed. \"As\n> you wish, Serena Butler.\"\n>\n> *Owing to the seductive nature of machines, we assume that\n> technological advances are always improvements and always beneficial\n> to humans.*\n\n--- PRIMERO FAYKAN BUTLER,\n\n*Memoirs of the Jihad*\n\n> **A**fter blaming the failure of his alloy resonator on incompetent\n> solvers, Tio Holtzman abandoned the project without further personal\n> embarrassment.

With\n> the goal of increasing the field's power and distribution, he wrestled\n> the equations as if they were living things. He needed to seal the\n> loophole that had allowed the cymeks to penetrate Salusa Secundus.\n>\n> He thought of offensive and defensive weapons at the same time,\n> bouncing them around in his mind like playthings. On general\n> principles, Holtzman knew that *outright destruction* of the enemy\n> would be relatively straightforward, once the League got past Omnius's\n> defenses. Simple bombardment with an overwhelming number of\n> old-fashioned atomic warheads could obliterate the Sychronized\n> Worlds--- but would also kill billions of enslaved human beings. Not a\n> viable solution.\n>\n> In his orrery atop a narrow staircase, Holtzman tapped the hologram\n> image of a large moon that orbited a watery planet. The moon spun out\n> in a long ellipse, escaping the gravitational clutches of its parent\n> planet and careening through the imaginary solar system until it\n> finally collided with another world, destroying both heavenly bodies.\n> He frowned and shut off the image.\n>\n> Yes, destruction was easy enough. Protection was much harder.\n>\n> Holtzman had considered bringing Norma in on his new scheme, but he\n> felt intimidated by the young woman. Despite his earlier successes, he\n> was ashamed that his own mathematical intuition was inferior to hers.\n> She would have been pleased to work beside him, of course, but he felt\n> proprietary toward the concept.

Holtzman walked around his laboratory, flashing glances\n> over his shoulder, but she would not be distracted--- not even when he\n> disturbed a stack of resonating tone prisms.\n>\n> Norma absorbed the new concepts as if she were in a hypnotic trance.\n> He wasn't certain how her mental processes worked, only that they did.\n> Finally she emerged from her alternate world and set the papers aside.\n> \"It is indeed a new form of protective field, Savant. Your\n> manipulation of basic equations is innovative, and even I have\n> difficulty comprehending them in detail.\" She smiled at him, looking\n> very girlish, and he tried not to swell with relief and pride.\n>\n> Then, to his dismay, her tone changed. \"However, I'm not certain that\n> the application you intend will be valid.\"\n>\n> Her words fell like drops of hot lead on his skin. \"What do you mean?\n> The field can disrupt both computer gelcircuitry and physical\n> intrusion.\"\n>\n> Norma ran her fingers across a section of calculations on the third\n> page. \"Your major limiting factor is the radius of effective\n> projection, here and here. No matter how much energy you pump into the\n> shield generator, you cannot expand it beyond a certain constant\n> value. Such a field could protect ships and large buildings---\n> marvelously, in fact--- but it will never scale up to the diameter of\n> a planet.\"\n>\n> \"Can we use multiple small ones, then?\" Holtzman asked in an anxious\n> tone. \"Overlap them?\"\n>\n> \"Maybe,\" Norma agreed, though without enthusiasm. \"But the surprising\n> thing to me is *this*, the velocity variable.\" She circled another\n> part of an equation with her fingertip. \"If you rework the mathematics\n> here\"--- she took a calculation box, rapidly punched a scribe through\n> several openings to\n>\n> engage internal mechanisms, and slid narrow surface plates back and\n> forth ---\"the incident velocity becomes relevant when you separate it\n> as a function of the shield's effectiveness. Thus, at some minimum\n> value for the velocity, the protection factor becomes completely\n> insignificant.\"\n>\n> Holtzman stared, struggling to follow her argument. \"What do you\n> mean?\"\n>\n> Norma was incredibly patient with him. \"In other words, if a\n> projectile moves *slowly enough*, it can penetrate your shields. The\n> shield will stop a fast bullet, but anything slower than a certain\n> critical value passes through.\"\n>\n> \"What sort of enemy fires slow-moving bullets anyway?\" Holtzman said,\n> pulling the papers back toward him. \"Are you afraid someone will be\n> hurt by a tossed apple?\"\n>\n> \"I am simply explaining the ramifications of the mathematics, Savant.\"\n>\n> \"So my shields can protect only small areas, and only against fast\n> projectiles. Is that what you're saying?\"\n>\n> \"Not I, Savant Holtzman. That is what your own equations say.\"\n>\n> \"Well, there must be a practical application. I just wanted to show\n> you my work in progress. I'm sure you'll come up with something much\n> more earth-shattering on your own.\"\n>\n> Norma seemed not to notice his petulance. \"Might I have a copy of\n> this?\"\n>\n> Holtzman frowned at himself for being petty, even unproductive. \"Yes,\n> yes, I'll have the solvers make one for you, while I go into private\n> contemplation. I may be gone for several days.\"\n>\n> \"I'll remain here,\" Norma said, still staring at the mathematics, \"and\n> keep working.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> FLOATING ON THE river aboard a lavish traditional barge, Holtzman\n> paced the airy deck and mulled over possibilities.

After a\n> fine dinner, they shared expensive drinks and reasonably intelligent\n> conversation. He basked in the adulation.\n>\n> But in the middle of the night, unable to sleep, he resumed his work.\n>\n> Clinging to his past successes, remembering when the ideas had flowed\n> so easily, he refused to give up on the new concept. His innovative\n> shields had remarkable potential, but perhaps he was thinking in the\n> wrong paradigm. His canvas was large and his mission vague, but his\n> strokes had been too broad.\n>\n> Why must he worry about armoring an entire planet at a time? Was that\n> really necessary?\n>\n> There were other kinds of warfare: personal combat with ground troops,\n> hand-to-hand battles in which humans could free their captive brothers\n> on the Synchronized Worlds.

The evermind would be nearly\n> impervious . . . unless commando teams could move directly into a\n> machine control center, as they had done on Giedi Prime.\n>\n> Now, as he paced the breezy deck of the river barge, stars glimmered\n> overhead. Holtzman gazed ahead into the sheer rock walls of the Isana\n> canyon, a deep gorge formed by the torrential river. He could hear a\n> whispering rumble of rapids approaching, but knew the barge would\n> steer through a safe channel along one side. He let his mind wander.\n>\n> Smaller shields . . . personal shields. Perhaps the invisible armor\n> would not stop slow projectiles, but they would be proof against most\n> military attacks.

In fact, it might save\n> billions of lives. People could wear the shields for personal\n> protection.

Far into the night, he wrote and rewrote his\n> equations. Finally he studied his results with bleary, grainy eyes and\n> proudly labeled them the \"Holtzman Effect.\"\n>\n> *Yes, this will do nicely indeed.*\n>\n> He would summon a fast transport and return to Starda, downriver.

Floating\n> barges from the continental flatlands--- loaded with cargoes of grain,\n> fermented grass juices, flowers, and local spices--- passed through\n> the gorge.\n>\n> Lord Bludd had decided to put up a giant mosaic on a canyon wall, a\n> titanic mural to commemorate the triumphs of his noble family. The\n> northern end of the artwork began with idealized depictions of his\n> ancestor Sajak Bludd, while the southern expanse remained an immense\n> virgin slate for the accomplishments of future Poritrin lords.\n>\n> Ishmael, Aliid, and their companions were forced to build the mosaic.\n> A pattern had already been laser-etched onto the walls by artists, and\n> the boys methodically placed tiles over the design, each piece a tiny\n> pixel of what would ultimately become a colorful display. Scaffolds\n> hung down, laden with geometric tiles cut from fired river clay and\n> glazed with gem-based tints imported from Hagal.\n>\n> Seen from the decks of boats far below, the mural would be\n> breathtaking. But suspended in a harness up close, Ishmael could not\n> identify details. He saw only a blurry honeycomb of tiles, one color\n> after another laid down with foul-smelling epoxies.\n>\n> In a sling beside him, Aliid noisily trimmed tiles to fit into place.\n> Machine sounds ricocheted across the canyon: rock saws, pointed\n> hammers, power chisels. Lamenting his stolen life, Aliid sang a song\n> from IV Anbus as he worked. Ishmael joined in with a similar ballad\n> about Harmonthep.\n>\n> Hanging ten meters below in his own harness, a boy named Ebbin\n> composed an impromptu musical chant describing his home of Souci, a\n> habitable moon so isolated that neither Aliid nor Ishmael had heard of\n> it. The Tlulaxa slavers, it seemed, were adept at finding lost\n> Buddislamic refugees, persecuting Zensunnis and Zenshiites alike.\n>\n> On the long ropes and harnesses, boys proved more agile and energetic\n> than grown men or women. They could scramble over the granite to lay\n> down colored tiles while cool winds whistled through the canyon. The\n> overseers expected no trouble.\n>\n> They were wrong.\n>\n> With simmering resentment, Aliid often repeated the defiant words of\n> Bel Moulay. The fiery Zenshiite leader dreamed of a time when slaves\n> could throw off their chains and live free again, returning to IV\n> Anbus or Harmonthep or even mysterious Souci. Ishmael listened to the\n> foolish talk, but didn't want to add kindling to Aliid's fire.\n>\n> Remembering his compassionate grandfather, Ishmael remained a patient\n> pacifist. He realized that it might take longer than his own lifespan\n> before the slavers were overthrown. Aliid did not want to wait. He\n> felt the slaves deserved revenge, as dark-bearded Bel Moulay promised\n> in his impassioned speeches. . . .\n>\n> Across the canyon, the flamboyant Lord Bludd arrived at the viewing\n> platform with his noble entourage. The Lord's own concepts and\n> sketches had been adapted to the canyon wall by court artists, and he\n> made regular pilgrimages to inspect the work. Each week, the viewing\n> platform was moved down the canyon as the immense mosaic grid crawled\n> slowly along the granite cliffs. Flanked by golden Dragoon guards, the\n> nobleman congratulated the project masters.\n>\n> Currently, the mural showed how his great-grandfather, Favo Bludd, had\n> created unique artwork out in the great grassy plains, geometric\n> designs of flowers and weeds that bloomed in different seasons. When\n> seen from the air, these transient art pieces changed like\n> kaleidoscopic images. Each season the flowers grew in patterns, then\n> went to seed and gradually formed more random congregations as winds\n> disturbed the planter's palette.\n>\n> From where Bludd watched, surrounded by mumbling sycophants, the slave\n> boys looked like insects crawling along the opposite wall. He heard\n> their equipment noises and the faint, high tones of young voices.\n>\n> The work was progressing well. Giant figures, faces, and starships\n> covered the granite: an epic depiction of the settlement of Poritrin\n> and the intentional destruction of all computers, which returned the\n> planet to a bucolic existence, dependent upon slave labor.\n>\n> A man of great pride, Bludd knew the faces of his ancestors well.\n> Unfortunately, as he studied the interplay of light and color on the\n> unfinished mosaic, he found himself dissatisfied with the face of old\n> Favo. Though the mosaic pattern precisely followed the image that had\n> been laser-etched onto the granite, now that he saw the result larger\n> than life, Niko Bludd was not pleased. \"Look at the face of Lord Favo.\n> Do you agree that it is inaccurate?\"\n>\n> Everyone in his party concurred immediately.

Ishmael\n> heard a snap as the rope broke far above.\n>\n> The line in his hand went limp, and Ishmael lurched wildly, grasping\n> at his harness. The fibrous cord that held Ebbin spun through his\n> clenched palm, burning skin. Ebbin reached up, in spite of his injury,\n> and his fingers barely missed Ishmael's. Then the boy dropped free,\n> his mouth open wide, his eyes bright and disbelieving. The frayed end\n> of the support cable popped through Ishmael's scorched hands as the\n> rope ran out.\n>\n> Ebbin tumbled toward the waiting Isana.

After catching the\n> crew boss at his attempted treachery, Ajax had clamped a free-formed\n> artificial hand around the man's right bicep and dragged him away from\n> his workers, screaming and stumbling.\n>\n> The slaves had stopped their tasks, looking with horror and pity at\n> their supervisor, now fallen to the wrath of Ajax. The cymek paraded\n> with his terrified captive through the monument-shadowed streets and\n> finally carried him into a hollow building. With squared-off facades\n> and ornate stone-work, the structure was called the Hall of Justice.\n>\n> That seemed infinitely appropriate to Ajax.\n>\n> Like so many grand edifices of Earth's central city grid, the Hall of\n> Justice was merely a stage set designed to convey a sense of majesty\n> and grandeur. Inside, the hall was an empty shell without facilities,\n> only a floor of plazcrete.\n>\n> Ajax and the traitor could be alone here for a lengthy private\n> interrogation. The very idea of a revolt among the slaves amused him\n> with its na\u00efve absurdity, especially the possibility that a trustee\n> would add his support to such nonsense.\n>\n> With a thoughtrode impulse, he focused his myriad optic threads on the\n> whimpering captive. The terrified man had soiled himself and sobbed\n> pathetically, making more excuses than denials. No need to hurry. Best\n> to play this out for his own enjoyment.\n>\n> \"You plotted to overthrow the rule of thinking machines.\" Ajax kept\n> his voice firm and deep. \"Concocting tales of a widespread underground\n> resistance, with the foolish aim of making slaves rise up and somehow\n> gain a fairytale independence from Omnius.\"\n>\n> \"It's not true!\" the man wailed. \"I swear I didn't know what I was\n> doing. I was following instructions. I received messages---\"\n>\n> \"You received messages commanding you to commit sedition, and did not\n> report them to me?\" Ajax's ominous laugh made the poor fellow wet\n> himself. \"Instead, you surreptitiously passed the word among your work\n> crews.\"\n>\n> The evidence of sedition was incontrovertible, and Ajax expected to be\n> rewarded for dealing with the problem.

What is your name?\"\n>\n> Shaping another menacing claw from his flowing metal limb-tip, Ajax\n> grasped the man's other hand.

He\n> especially enjoyed this part of his job, when he could improvise pain\n> and inflict it like a master designer.\n>\n> Some of the other Titans considered Ajax a loose cannon. But if a\n> leader couldn't show a little domination over a vanquished people,\n> what was the point of taking over the Old Empire in the first place?\n> Even in their glory days, Ajax had never been interested, like Xerxes,\n> in extravagant food and drink, or in a pampered lifestyle with toys\n> and pleasures like his own spoiled mate, Hecate.\n>\n> No, Ajax had joined the team for the sheer challenge of it. Early on,\n> when Tlaloc had made plans with his fellow conspirators, seductive\n> Juno had recruited Ajax to their cause. A tough and aggressive\n> fighter, Ajax had provided the muscle the Titans needed--- not just\n> physical strength, but the mindset of a warrior, a relentless\n> conqueror. Following the initial overthrow of the humans, he had done\n> his best to maintain order, regardless of the cost in the blood of\n> noncombatants.\n>\n> The vermin invariably attempted one uprising or another, but Ajax\n> easily extinguished these little brushfires. When the more organized\n> Hrethgir Rebellions threatened the Titans, Ajax had responded with\n> astonishing mayhem. He had gone to Walgis, the site of the rebellion's\n> initial sparks, and closed off the planet from space transportation.\n> He'd made a point of leaving communications open so that the doomed\n> populace could scream\n>\n> for help. That way, restless slaves on other Titan-controlled worlds\n> could experience the punishment vicariously.\n>\n> Then he set to work.\n>\n> The essential job had taken years, but Ajax finally succeeded in\n> exterminating every living human on Walgis--- committing most of the\n> murder with atomics, poison gas clouds, and customized diseases. To\n> finish off the survivors, Ajax had installed his brain canister inside\n> a monstrous and intimidating body and hunted the humans down like wild\n> animals. Accompanied by squads of Barbarossa's programmed robots, he\n> had burned cities, smashed buildings, ferreted out any human presence.\n> He killed every last one of the *hrethgir*, and enjoyed it\n> immeasurably.\n>\n> Truly, those had been the glory days of the Titans!\n>\n> The violence, however justified, had troubled his mate Hecate, the\n> weakest and most squeamish of the original twenty. Although she had\n> joined Tlaloc's rebellion to earn rewards for herself, she'd never\n> understood the necessities of the job and had gradually wilted from\n> it. After the Titans had sacrificed their human bodies in favor of an\n> immortal existence as cymeks, Hecate had remained with Ajax, all the\n> while trying unsuccessfully to change his personality. Despite their\n> disagreements, Ajax had been fond of her, though his need for a lover\n> had vanished with his physical form.\n>\n> Appalled at Ajax's bloodthirsty response to the Hrethgir Rebellions,\n> Hecate had \"resigned\" her position among the Titans. She wanted\n> nothing more to do with ruling humanity. Encased in a cymek body of\n> her own design, a long-range space vessel, Hecate simply departed,\n> leaving the remaining Titans to continue their death grip on humanity.\n>\n> Ironically, Hecate had chosen the perfect time to leave. Not long\n> after the obliteration of humans on Walgis, Xerxes's fatal error had\n> allowed the Omnius evermind to get loose. . . .\n>\n> Now, inside the blood-spattered Hall of Justice, Ajax raised his\n> intimidating body high. He powered up his systems so that neurelectric\n> fire gleamed\n>\n> through his insectlike limbs.\n>\n> The captive traitor screamed at the very thought of what was about to\n> happen to him.\n>\n> \"Now, Ohan Freer,\" Ajax said, \"let me ask you certain other questions.\n> I want you to pay close attention.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> BY COMMAND OF Omnius, the crew boss Iblis Ginjo brought his loyal\n> slaves into the Golden Age Square. Ajax was about to pronounce\n> sentence\n>\n> --- execution, no doubt--- upon a man he had taken captive, a crew\n> boss from another labor gang, Ohan Freer.\n>\n> Iblis had trained with the accused trustee in the special schools, but\n> he had never seen his fellow crew boss do anything illegal. Ajax\n> rarely needed much of an excuse, however. He himself had experienced\n> the Titan's displeasure more than once, but so far had managed to\n> survive. He doubted his compatriot would fare as well today.\n>\n> An ornate metal-worked column stood in the center of the square. A\n> roaring orange flame gushed from the top of the pillar, like an\n> ornamental smokestack. Fanciful facades of immense buildings, all\n> empty, surrounded the plaza like prison walls around a central\n> courtyard. Omnius's sentinel robots looked powerful and portentous in\n> formations along the sides of the square, ready to strike against any\n> perceived infraction by the expendable human slaves.\n>\n> Iblis guided his crew into the partitioned viewing areas, voicing a\n> few words of reassurance, though not enough to upset the cymeks. Ajax\n> loved showmanship, wanted to make certain every terrified eye\n> witnessed his actions. When Iblis and the other crew bosses blew\n> whistles to signal their readiness, Ajax emerged, carrying his maimed\n> prisoner.\n>\n> The Titan wore an antlike body with an impressive ellipsoidal core,\n> heavy walking legs, and four grasping arms in which he held Ohan\n> Freer.\n>\n> Hovering watcheyes captured images and fed a steady stream of data to\n> the evermind.\n>\n> Beneath the flaming pillar, Ajax clutched the squirming victim like a\n> giant ant soldier with a hapless enemy beetle. Doomed Ohan had been\n> burned, bloodied, and wounded; his left hand was only a charred stump.\n> Blossoming bruises discolored his skin. A thin, watery wail leaked\n> from his mouth.\n>\n> A mutter of dismay came from the human onlookers. Watching them, Iblis\n> knew these workers could not have been the source of the rebellion,\n> despite the mysterious and provocative messages he had received. What\n> if he was deluding himself and the secret call to freedom was simply a\n> wishful suggestion voiced by another desperate person?\n>\n> Lifting the unfortunate captive high, Ajax amplified his vocal\n> synthesizers so that his words boomed like a projectile cannon around\n> the enclosed square. \"Some of you have heard this criminal speak. Some\n> of you may have had the poor judgment to listen to his silly\n> imaginings about freedom and rebellion. You would be wiser to cut off\n> your ears than listen to such foolishness.\"\n>\n> The crowd held its collective breath. Iblis bit his lower lip, not\n> wanting to watch, but fixated on the imminent horror. If he averted\n> his gaze, the watcheyes might well detect it, and he would hear about\n> it later. As a consequence, Iblis stared at every unfolding second.\n>\n> \"This poor, deluded man is no longer necessary to the continued glory\n> of Omnius in the reign of the thinking machines.\"\n>\n> Ohan screamed, and struggled weakly. Ajax held the man's intact arm in\n> one roughly formed pincer claw and each leg in two others. With his\n> last claw, Ajax wrapped a long, sharp embrace around Ohan's chest,\n> under his armpits.\n>\n> \"He is no longer a worker. He is no longer even *hrethgir*, one of the\n> unruly humans who survive at our own sufferance. He is *garbage*.\"\n> Ajax paused.\n>\n> \"And garbage is to be discarded.\"\n>\n> Then, without a sound or any sign of effort, Ajax pulled his\n> artificial limbs in different directions, tearing the helpless Ohan\n> asunder. The man's arms and legs ripped free, his chest tore open and\n> broken bones pierced skin. Blood and entrails spilled onto the clean\n> flagstones of the Golden Age Square.\n>\n> Ajax flung the bloody parts into the screaming crowd. \"Enough of this\n> nonsense! There is no rebellion. Now get back to work.\"\n>\n> The sickened workers seemed only too eager to race back to their\n> tasks, looking to Iblis as they left, as if he could protect them. But\n> Iblis still stared in disbelieving amazement. Ohan Freer had been a\n> member of the rebellion! The crew boss had spread dissent, made plans,\n> perhaps sent and received messages.\n>\n> *Another rebel!*\n>\n> Appalled, Iblis knew the danger to himself was even greater now, if he\n> continued to act. Nonetheless, today's execution had shown him one\n> thing more clearly than ever: The brewing human rebellion was not just\n> his imagination.\n>\n> *It is real!*\n>\n> If Ohan had been part of it, then there must be others, too--- many of\n> them. This underground network of fighters, which included Iblis, was\n> safely separated into cells so that no one could betray the others.\n> Now he understood.\n>\n> He began to make plans with even greater conviction than before.\n>\n> *Humans deny a continuum of possibilities, an infinite number of\n> realms into which their species may enter.*\n>\n> --- ERASMUS,\n\nnotes on human nature\n\n> **I**t was a makeshift performance hall, inside a marble-walled\n> building on the robot's estate. Erasmus had worked his slave crews to\n> modify the interior, install seats, and retool the walls, all to\n> create perfect acoustics for this single performance. Erasmus had\n> studied records of the greatest human classical music, knew exactly\n> what was expected of grand symphonies, from the audience to the\n> setting. He had high standards for his artistic endeavors.\n>\n> The robot invited Serena Butler, now in her eighth month of pregnancy,\n> to sit in a large central chair for the concert. \"These other people\n> might experience pleasure from the melody and the sounds, but you have\n> different expectations. On Salusa Secundus, sophisticated music was a\n> part of your existence.\"\n>\n> With a pang, Serena thought of her brother and his musical\n> aspirations. She had learned to appreciate the enduring works of\n> long-vanished human composers. \"Music is not the only thing I miss,\n> Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \"You and I speak the same cultured language,\" he said, not noticing\n> her pointed remark. \"You will tell me how you enjoy this composition.\n> I had you in mind when I wrote it.\"\n>\n> He filled the performance hall with worker-caste slaves culled from a\n> variety of skilled labor assignments. They were cleaned up and dressed\n> according to Erasmus's concept of a high-class audience.\n>\n> Electronic portraits of great human composers lined the interior\n> walls, as if the robot wanted to count himself among their number.\n> Around the perimeter of the concert hall, museum-type display cases\n> held musical\n>\n> instruments--- a lute, a rebec, a gilded tambour, and an antique\n> fifteen-string baliset with inlaid vabalone shells on its case.\n>\n> In the center of the mezzanine stage beneath open rafters, Erasmus sat\n> alone before a grand piano, surrounded by music synthesizers,\n> speakers, and a sound-misting station. Wearing a formal black suit\n> with a cut similar to a tuxedo but redesigned to accommodate his\n> robotic body, Erasmus sat at attention, his face a smooth mirrored\n> oval, showing no expression.\n>\n> Shifting to find a more comfortable position for her back, Serena\n> watched the inquisitor robot. She rested a hand on her enormous\n> abdomen, felt the movements of the restless baby. Within weeks, she\n> would deliver her child.\n>\n> Around her, the captive audience shifted uneasily, not sure what to\n> expect, or what was expected of them. Erasmus turned his mirrored face\n> toward the audience, reflecting them as he waited, and waited. Finally\n> silence fell.\n>\n> \"Thank you for your attention.\" He turned to a shiny silver apparatus\n> beside him, a music synthesizer with dancing polymer fingertips that\n> produced familiar riffs and chords. The background music increased in\n> volume, laced with stringed instruments and mournful Chusuk horns.\n>\n> The robot listened for several moments, then continued, \"You are about\n> to experience something truly remarkable. To demonstrate my respect\n> for the creative spirit, I have composed a new symphony especially for\n> you, my hardworking slaves. No human has ever heard it before.\"\n>\n> He played a rapid mixture of melodies on the piano, running through\n> three short passages in an apparent effort to confirm that the\n> instrument was tuned properly. \"After detailed analysis of the field,\n> I have written a symphony comparable to the works of the great human\n> composers Johannes Brahms and Emi Chusuk. I developed my piece\n> according to strict principles of order and mathematics.\"\n>\n> Serena perused the audience, doubting any of the humans raised in\n> captivity were familiar with the classical music the robot had\n> mentioned. Schooled on Salusa Secundus, where music and art were\n> integral parts of the culture,\n>\n> Serena had listened to the renowned works of many composers, even\n> discussing them at length with Fredo.\n>\n> With a mental pulse Erasmus linked his gelcircuitry mind to the\n> synthesizer, producing a strange, repetitious melody. Then his\n> mechanical fingers danced over the keyboard, and he made frequent\n> sweeping gestures as he played, as if imitating a famous concert\n> pianist.\n>\n> Serena found the composition pleasant enough, but unremarkable. And,\n> although she did not recognize the precise melody, it had a strangely\n> familiar character, as if the robot had mathematically analyzed an\n> existing piece measure by measure and followed the pattern, changing a\n> rhythm here, a polyphonic passage there. The music felt lackluster,\n> with no powerful driving force.\n>\n> Erasmus apparently believed it was a human instinct to appreciate a\n> new work, that his captive audience would intrinsically note the\n> nuances and complexities of his structurally perfect composition. The\n> slaves around Serena shifted in their seats and listened; to them,\n> this was a pleasant enough diversion but just another work assignment.\n> The conscripted audience seemed to enjoy the soothing notes of the\n> melody, but it did not move them in the way the robot desired.\n>\n> When at last he ceased his performance, Erasmus sat back from the\n> piano, deactivated the symphonic support equipment, and let the\n> silence deepen. The reverberating tones faded.\n>\n> For a moment, the slaves hesitated as if waiting for instructions.\n> Erasmus said, \"You may give an ovation if you enjoyed the piece.\" They\n> didn't seem to understand the reference, until he said, \"Signify by\n> clapping your hands.\"\n>\n> An initial wave of applause came as a sparse patter like raindrops,\n> then swelled into louder clapping--- as was expected of them. Serena\n> joined in politely, though not enthusiastically. A small act of\n> honesty that she was sure Erasmus would notice.\n>\n> The robot's shining mask had shifted into a proud smile. In his formal\n> black garment he walked smoothly down a staircase from the mezzanine\n> stage to the main floor. The slaves continued to applaud, and he\n> basked in the apparent adulation. When the acclamation receded, he\n> summoned sentinel guards to escort the audience back to their regular\n> work assignments.\n>\n> Serena could see that Erasmus believed he had created an enduring work\n> of merit that possibly surpassed what humans had achieved. But she\n> didn't want to discuss it with him, and tried to slip away to her\n> greenhouse work. She moved slowly because of her pregnancy, however,\n> and Erasmus caught up with her. \"Serena Butler, I wrote this symphony\n> for your benefit. Are you not impressed by it?\"\n>\n> She selected her words carefully, avoiding a candid answer. \"Perhaps I\n> am simply sad because your symphony reminds me of other performances I\n> watched on Salusa Secundus. My late brother wanted to be a musician.\n> Those were happier times for me.\"\n>\n> He looked at her closely, his optic threads sparkling. \"Nuances of\n> human behavior tell me that my symphony has disappointed you. Explain\n> why.\"\n>\n> \"You don't want an honest opinion.\"\n>\n> \"You misjudge me, for I am a seeker of truth. Anything else is faulty\n> data.\" His cherubic expression caused her to lower her guard. \"Is\n> there something wrong with the acoustics in this hall?\"\n>\n> \"It's nothing to do with the acoustics. I'm sure you tested everything\n> to technical perfection.\" The audience continued to move toward the\n> exits, some looking over their shoulders at Serena with pity that the\n> robot had taken a special interest in her. \"It was the symphony\n> itself.\"\n>\n> \"Continue,\" Erasmus said. His voice was flat.\n>\n> \"You assembled that piece, you didn't *create* it. It was based on\n> precise models developed ages ago by human composers. The only\n> creativity I heard came from their minds, not yours. Your music was a\n> mathematical\n>\n> extrapolation, but nothing that inspired me in any way. The tune you .\n> . .*engineered* evoked no images or feelings within me. There was no\n> fresh element that you contributed, nothing emotionally compelling.\"\n>\n> \"How am I to quantify such an ingredient?\"\n>\n> Forcing a smile, Serena shook her head. \"Therein lies your mistake,\n> Erasmus. It is impossible to quantify creativity. How does a person\n> hear a thunderstorm and use that experience to write the 'William Tell\n> Overture'? You would simply imitate the sounds of thunder and rain,\n> Erasmus, but you wouldn't *evoke the impression* of a storm. How did\n> Beethoven look at a peaceful meadow and adapt that experience into his\n> 'Pastorale'? Music should make the spirit soar, take the breath away,\n> touch the soul. Your work was just . . . pleasant tones, adequately\n> performed.\"\n>\n> The robot took several seconds to change the expression on his face,\n> and finally looked at her with perplexity, even defensiveness. \"Your\n> opinion seems to be in the minority. The rest of the audience greatly\n> appreciated the work. Did you not notice their applause?\"\n>\n> She sighed. \"First of all, those slaves have no knowledge of music, no\n> basis of comparison. You could have stolen any symphony from a\n> classical composer, note for note, and called it your own. They\n> wouldn't have known the difference.\n>\n> \"Second, sitting in a concert hall--- comfortable, clean, and\n> well-dressed--- is probably the best work assignment you've ever given\n> them. Why wouldn't they clap for that reason alone?\"\n>\n> She looked at him. \"Finally, and most important, you *told* them to\n> applaud. How are they supposed to react, when they know you could have\n> them killed at any moment? Under such circumstances, Erasmus, you will\n> never get a fair and honest response.\"\n>\n> \"I do not understand, cannot understand.\" Erasmus repeated this\n> several times. Abruptly, he whirled and swung a hardened fist into the\n> face of a\n>\n> man who walked past. The unexpected blow sent the victim crashing over\n> the chairs, bleeding.\n>\n> \"Why did you do that?\" Serena demanded, rushing over to help the man.\n>\n> \"Artistic temperament,\" Erasmus said calmly. \"Is that not what humans\n> call it? He tried to deceive me about how he really felt.\"\n>\n> She tried to soothe the man, but when he looked up to see the robot,\n> the slave struggled away, holding a hand up to stop the blood dripping\n> from his nose. Serena rounded on Erasmus. \"True artists are sensitive\n> and compassionate. They don't need to *hurt* people to make them\n> feel.\"\n>\n> \"You are not afraid to voice your opinion, even when you believe it\n> might displease me?\"\n>\n> Serena looked directly into his unnatural face. \"You hold me prisoner,\n> Erasmus. You claim to want my opinion, so I give it. You can hurt me,\n> even murder me, but you have already taken me away from my life and\n> the man I love. Any further pain pales in comparison.\"\n>\n> Erasmus stared at her, assessing what she had said. \"Humans are\n> perplexing to me--- and you more than anyone, Serena Butler.\" His\n> flowmetal countenance took on a smiling expression. \"But I will keep\n> trying to understand. Thank you for your insights.\"\n>\n> As Serena left the hall, Erasmus returned to the piano and began\n> practicing.\n>\n> *Above all, I am a man of honor. This is how I wish to be remembered.*\n\n--- XAVIER HARKONNEN,\n\ncomment to his men\n", "metadata": {}, "type": null, "config": {}, "parent": null, "children": [{"id": "f0860994-c11e-4c2e-a481-c82975833c69", "name": "The Titans' Secret Meeting on a Planetoid", "content": "The Titans' Secret Meeting on a Planetoid", "body": "", "metadata": {}, "type": null, "config": {}, "parent": null, "children": [], "start": 1983, "end": 1948, "full_body": ""}, {"id": "24c2a528-ed24-47e9-8a27-fa4c1e257cbb", "name": "Agamemnon's Plan to Strike Against Omnius", "content": "Agamemnon's Plan to Strike Against Omnius", "body": "> so that we may plan a strike against Omnius.\"\n>\n> \"It's about time,\" Ajax said, his voice a deep grumble.\n>\n> \"Do you believe the evermind has grown complacent, my love--- like the\n> humans of the Old Empire?\" Juno asked.\n>\n> \"I have noted no particular sign of weakness,\" Dante interjected, \"and\n> I keep careful track of such things.\"\n>\n> \"There are always weaknesses,\" Ajax said, twitching one of his heavy\n> armored legs and gouging a hole in the ground, \"*if* you're willing to\n> use enough muscle to exploit them.\"\n>\n> Barbarossa clacked one of his metal forelegs on the hard rock. \"Do not\n> be fooled by artificial intelligence.

My father teaches me that,\n> despite our many weaknesses, we humans have a trump card with our very\n> unpredictability.\" Smiling, Vorian went to the robot captain's side\n> and studied the metric screens. \"Why do you think Omnius asks me to\n> throw a wrench into his careful simulations every time he plans an\n> encounter with the *hrethgir*?\"\n>\n> \"Your outrageous and reckless chaos is the only reason you are able to\n> beat me in any strategy game,\" Seurat said. \"It certainly has nothing\n> to do with your innate skills.\"\n>\n> \"A winner has more skills than a loser,\" Vor said, \"no matter how you\n> define the competition.\"\n>\n> The update ship traveled on a regular, continuous route throughout the\n> Synchronized Worlds. One of fifteen such vessels, the *Dream Voyager*\n> carried copies of the current version of Omnius to synchronize the\n> separate computer everminds on widely separated planets.\n>\n> Circuitry limitations and electronic transmission speeds constrained\n> the physical size of any individual machine; thus, the same computer\n> evermind could not viably extend beyond a single planet. Nonetheless,\n> duplicate copies of Omnius existed everywhere, like mental clones.\n> With regular updates continually exchanged by ships like the *Dream\n> Voyager*, all the separate Omnius incarnations remained virtually\n> identical across the machine-dominated autarchy.\n>\n> After many voyages, Vor knew how to operate the ship and could access\n> all onboard data banks using Seurat's codes. Over the years, he and\n> the robot captain had become fast friends in a way that others were\n> not likely to understand. Because of the extended time they shared in\n> deep space, talking about many things, playing games of skill, telling\n> stories--- they bridged much of the gap between machine and man.\n>\n> Sometimes, for amusement, Vor and Seurat traded places, and Vor\n> pretended to be the captain of the ship, while Seurat became his\n> robotic underling, as in the days of the Old Empire. During one\n> role-playing session, Vorian had impulsively christened the ship\n> *Dream Voyager*, a bit of poetic nonsense that Seurat not only\n> tolerated, but maintained.\n>\n> As a sentient machine, Seurat routinely received new instructions and\n> memory transfers from the overall Omnius brain, but because he spent\n> so much time disconnected while journeying between the stars, he had\n> developed his own personality and independence. In Vor's opinion,\n> Seurat was the best of the machine minds, although the robot could be\n> irritating at times. Especially with that peculiar sense of humor.\n>\n> Vor clasped his hands and cracked his knuckles. He sighed with\n> pleasure. \"Sure feels good to loosen up. Too bad it's something you\n> can't do.\"\n>\n> \"I do not require loosening up.\"\n>\n> Vorian didn't admit that he, too, found his own organic body to be\n> inferior in many ways, fragile and prone to aches, sicknesses, and\n> injuries that any machine could have easily fixed. He hoped that his\n> physical form would remain functional long enough for him to be made\n> into one of the enduring neo-cymeks, all of whom had once been valued\n> trustee humans, like himself. One day Agamemnon would receive\n> permission from Omnius for that, if Vor worked very hard to serve the\n> evermind.\n>\n> The *Dream Voyager* had been in space on a long update run, and the\n> young trustee was glad to be going home. He would see his eminent\n> father soon.\n>\n> As the *Dream Voyager* soared between stars, undisturbed, Seurat\n> suggested a friendly competition. The two sat at a table and engaged\n> in one of their customary diversions, an amusing private game they had\n> developed through frequent practice. The strategy involved an\n> imaginary space battle between two alien races--- the \"Vorians\" and\n> the \"Seurats\"--- each of which had a space fleet with precise\n> capabilities and limitations. Though the robot captain had a perfect\n> machine memory, Vor still fared well, as he invariably came up with\n> creative tactics that surprised his opponent.\n>\n> Now, as they took turns placing warships in the various sectors of\n> their fanciful space battlefield, Seurat reeled off an endless\n> succession of human jokes and riddles he had found in his old\n> databases. Annoyed, Vor finally said, \"You're making an overt attempt\n> to distract me. Where did you learn to do that?\"\n>\n> \"Why, from you, of course.\" The robot proceeded to mention the many\n> times in which Vor had teased him, threatening to sabotage the ship\n> without ever really intending to do so, concocting extraordinarily\n> unpredictable emergencies. \"Do you consider it cheating? On your part,\n> or on mine?\"\n>\n> This revelation astonished Vor. \"It saddens me to think that, even in\n> jest, I have taught you deception. It makes me ashamed to be human.\"\n> No doubt, Agamemnon would be disappointed in him.\n>\n> After two more rounds, Vor lost the tactical game. His heart was no\n> longer in it.\n>\n> *Every endeavor is a game, is it not?*\n\n--- IBLIS GINJO,\n\n*Options for Total Liberation*\n\n> **O**n a garden terrace overlooking the scarred ruins of Zimia, Xavier\n> Harkonnen stood somberly by himself, dreading the upcoming \"victory\"\n> parade. Afternoon sunlight warmed his face. Birdsong had replaced the\n> screams and explosions; breezes had scoured away the worst of the\n> poisonous smoke.\n>\n> Still, the League would be a long time recovering. Nothing would ever\n> be the same.\n>\n> Even days after the attack, he still saw smears of smoke wafting from\n> the rubble and trailing into a cloudless sky. He could not smell the\n> soot, though. The cymeks' poison gas had so damaged his tissues that\n> he would never smell or taste much of anything again. Even breathing\n> had become no more that a mechanical act, not an enjoyable inhalation\n> of sweet fresh air.\n>\n> But he could not wallow in misery when so many others had lost much\n> more. In the aftermath of the cymek attack, he had been kept alive by\n> the heroic efforts of a Salusan medical team. Serena Butler had come\n> to him at the hospital, but he remembered her only through a fog of\n> pain, drugs, and life-support systems. In an extraordinary procedure,\n> Xavier had received a double lung transplant, healthy organs provided\n> by the mysterious Tlulaxa. He knew Serena had worked vigorously with\n> the brilliant battlefield surgeons and a Tlulaxa flesh merchant named\n> Tuk Keedair to get him the treatment he needed.\n>\n> Now he could breathe again, despite intermittent bursts of pain.\n> Xavier would live to fight the machines another time. Thanks to\n> pharmaceuticals and advanced healing techniques, he had been able to\n> leave the hospital soon after the medical procedure.\n>\n> At the time of the attack, the flesh merchant Keedair had been in\n> Zimia on a routine sales call and barely escaped with his life. On the\n> Unallied Planet of Tlulax in the distant Thalim solar system, his\n> people ran organ farms, growing human hearts, lungs, kidneys, and\n> other body parts from viable cells. After the cymeks were driven away,\n> the secretive Tlulaxa had offered his biological wares to the\n> battlefield surgeons at Zimia's main field hospital. His ship's\n> cryogenic lockers were filled with sample body parts. A stroke of\n> luck, Keedair had admitted with a smile, that he could be there to\n> help the grievously injured Salusan citizens during their time of\n> great need.\n>\n> Following the successful surgery, Keedair had come to see Xavier in\n> the medical center. The Tlulaxa was a man of middle height but slight\n> of build, with dark eyes and an angular face. A long, dark braid hung\n> at the left side of his head, plaited tightly.\n>\n> Breathing in, carefully modulating his raspy voice, Xavier said, \"It\n> was fortunate you were here with new organs already stored aboard your\n> ship.\"\n>\n> Keedair rubbed his long-fingered hands together. \"If I had known the\n> cymeks would strike so ferociously, I would have brought a larger\n> supply of material from our organ farms. Your Salusan survivors could\n> use many more replacement parts, but additional ships cannot arrive\n> from the Thalim system for months.\"\n>\n> Before the flesh merchant left Xavier's room, he turned back and said,\n> \"Consider yourself one of the lucky ones, Tercero Harkonnen.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> IN BATTLE-SCARRED ZIMIA, grief-stricken survivors searched for their\n> dead, and buried them. As rubble was cleared, the death toll mounted.\n> Bodies were recovered, names of the missing were compiled. In spite of\n> such pain and sorrow, because of the attack free humanity grew\n> stronger.\n>\n> Viceroy Manion Butler had insisted that the people show only\n> determination in the aftermath. On the streets below Xavier's terrace,\n> final preparations were under way for a celebration of thanksgiving.\n> Banners\n>\n> with the open-hand sigil of human freedom fluttered in the wind.\n> Rough-looking men in dirty coats struggled to control magnificent\n> white Salusan stallions that had become agitated by the commotion. The\n> horses' manes were braided with tassles and bells, and their tails\n> swept behind them like waterfalls of fine hair. Festooned with ribbons\n> and flowers, the animals pranced, eager to march down the broad\n> central boulevard that had been washed clean of debris, soot, and\n> bloodstains.\n>\n> Xavier glanced uncertainly at the sky. How could he ever look at the\n> clouds again without dreading that he might see more pyramidal\n> dropcarriages plunging through the scrambler shields? Missiles were\n> already being installed, increased batteries to protect against an\n> attack from space. More patrols would be launched, circling the system\n> on the highest state of alert.\n>\n> Instead of attending a parade, he should be preparing the Salusan\n> Militia for another attack, increasing the number of picket ships and\n> scouts at the edge of the system, working out a more efficient rescue\n> and response plan. It was only a matter of time before the thinking\n> machines returned.\n>\n> The next meeting of the League Parliament would devote itself to\n> emergency measures and reparations. The representatives would sketch\n> out a reconstruction plan for Zimia. The cymek warrior-forms left\n> behind must be dismantled and analyzed for weaknesses.\n>\n> Xavier hoped the League would immediately dispatch a summons to\n> Poritrin, calling the brilliant Tio Holtzman to inspect his recently\n> installed scrambler shields. Only the great inventor himself could\n> devise a stopgap measure against the technical flaw the cymeks had\n> discovered.\n>\n> When Xavier mentioned his concerns to Viceroy Butler, the florid-faced\n> leader had nodded, but stopped further discussion. \"First, we must\n> have a day of affirmation, to celebrate the fact that we are alive.\"\n> Xavier saw deep sadness behind the Viceroy's mask of confidence. \"We\n> are not machines, Xavier. There must be more to our lives than war and\n> revenge.\"\n>\n> Hearing footsteps on the terrace, Xavier turned to see Serena Butler\n> smiling at him, her eyes flashing with a secret depth that she shared\n> with him now\n>\n> that no one could see the two of them. \"There is my heroic tercero.\"\n>\n> \"A man responsible for letting half a city be destroyed isn't usually\n> called a hero, Serena.\"\n>\n> \"No, but the term does apply to a man who saved the rest of the\n> planet. As you are fully aware, if you hadn't made your hard choice,\n> all of Zimia, all of Salusa, would have been crushed.\" She put a hand\n> on his shoulder and stood very close to him. \"I won't have you\n> wallowing in guilt during the victory parade. One day won't make much\n> difference.\"\n>\n> \"One day could very well make a *huge* difference,\" Xavier insisted.\n> \"We barely drove off the attackers this time because we were too\n> confident in the new scrambler shields, and because we foolishly\n> thought Omnius had decided to leave us alone after so many decades.\n> This would be the perfect time for them to hit us again. What if\n> they've launched a second wave?\"\n>\n> \"Omnius is still licking his wounds. I doubt his force has even\n> returned to the Synchronized Worlds yet.\"\n>\n> \"Machines don't lick wounds,\" he said.\n>\n> \"You're such a serious young man,\" she said. \"Please, just for the\n> parade? Our people need to have their spirits uplifted.\"\n>\n> \"Your father already gave me the same lecture.\"\n>\n> \"You know, of course, that if two Butlers say a thing, it's bound to\n> be true.\"\n>\n> He gave Serena a firm hug, then followed her from the terrace toward\n> the parade reviewing stand, where he would sit in a place of honor\n> beside the Viceroy.\n>\n> Since they'd been children, Xavier had always found himself attracted\n> to Serena; as they matured, they had grown confident of their\n> deepening feelings toward each other. Both he and Serena considered it\n> a foregone\n>\n> conclusion that they would wed, a rare perfect match of politics,\n> acceptable bloodlines, and romance.\n>\n> Now, though, with the sudden increase in hostilities, he reminded\n> himself of his greater priorities. Thanks to the disaster that had\n> killed Primero Meach, Xavier Harkonnen was interim commander of the\n> Salusan Militia, which forced him to face larger issues. He wanted to\n> do so much, but he was only one man.\n>\n> An hour later, the assemblage sat on a grandstand in the central\n> plaza. Scaffolding and temporary girders shored up the broken facades\n> of government buildings. The ornamental fountains no longer\n> functioned, but the citizens of Zimia knew there could be no other\n> place for such a presentation.\n>\n> Even burned and damaged, the tall edifices looked magnificent:\n> constructed in Salusan Gothic style with multilevel roof lines,\n> spires, and carved columns. Salusa Secundus was the seat of the League\n> government, but it also hosted the leading cultural and\n> anthropological museums. In surrounding neighborhoods, the crowded\n> dwellings were of simpler construction but pleasing to the eye,\n> whitewashed with lime taken from chalk cliffs. Salusans prided\n> themselves on having the best craftsmen and artisans in the League.\n> They did most of their production by hand instead of with automated\n> machinery.\n>\n> Along the parade route, the citizens dressed in colorful raiment of\n> magenta, blue, and yellow. People chattered and pointed as the\n> remarkable stallions passed them, followed by marching musicians and\n> folk dancers on hover-floats. One monstrous Salusan bull, drugged into\n> a near stupor to control it, plodded down the street.\n>\n> Though Xavier made the best of it all, he found himself constantly\n> glancing at the sky, and at the scars of the wounded city. . . .\n>\n> At the conclusion of the parade, Manion Butler delivered a speech\n> celebrating the successful defense but acknowledging the high cost of\n> the battle, tens of thousands killed or wounded. \"We have much healing\n> and\n>\n> recovery to do, but we also have an unbroken spirit, no matter what\n> the thinking machines may attempt.\"\n>\n> Addressing the crowd, the Viceroy summoned Xavier to the central\n> platform. \"I present for you our greatest hero, a man who stood firm\n> against the cymeks and made the *necessary* decisions to save us all.\n> Few others would have been strong enough to do the same.\"\n>\n> Feeling out of place, Xavier stepped forward to receive a military\n> medal on a striped blue, red, and gold ribbon from the Viceroy. In the\n> midst of cheers, Serena kissed him on the cheek. He hoped no one in\n> the crowd could see him blush.\n>\n> \"With this commendation comes a promotion to the rank of Tercero,\n> First Grade. Xavier Harkonnen, I charge you with studying defensive\n> tactics and installations for the entire League Armada. Your duties\n> will encompass the local Salusan Militia, along with responsibility\n> for improving the military security of the entire League of Nobles.\"\n>\n> The young officer felt awkward from the attention, but he graciously\n> accepted the accolades. \"I look forward to beginning the hard work of\n> our survival . . . and advancement.\" He favored Serena with an\n> indulgent smile. \"Following today's festivities, of course.\"\n>\n> *Dune is the planet-child of the worm.*\n\n--- from \"The Legend of Selim Wormrider,\" Zensunni Fire Poetry\n\n> **F**or an entire day and deep into the night, the monstrous sandworm\n> raced across the desert, forced beyond its normal territorial range.\n>\n> As the two moons rose and shone their curious light down upon Selim,\n> he clung to his metal staff, completely exhausted. Though he had\n> escaped being devoured by the wild and confused creature, he might\n> soon perish from the interminable ride. Buddallah had saved him, but\n> now seemed only to be toying with him.\n>\n> While thrusting the corroded spear, the youth had wedged himself into\n> a gap between worm segments, hoping he wouldn't be buried alive if the\n> demon plunged beneath the dunes. He huddled against rank flesh that\n> smelled of rotten meat impregnated with pungent cinnamon. He didn't\n> know what to do, but prayed and contemplated, searching for an\n> explanation.\n>\n> *Perhaps it is a test of some kind.*\n>\n> The sandworm continued to flee across the desert, its undersized brain\n> seemingly resigned to never again finding peace or safety. The beast\n> wanted to wallow into the dunes and hide from this malicious imp, but\n> Selim pried the spear as if it were a lever, irritating the wound\n> anew.\n>\n> The worm could only surge onward. Hour after hour.\n>\n> Selim's throat was parched, his eyes caked with grit. He must have\n> crossed half the desert already, and recognized no landforms on the\n> monotonous open bled. He had never been so far from the cave\n> community--- no one had, as far as he knew. Even if he somehow escaped\n> this giant monster, he would be doomed in the unforgiving Arrakis\n> wasteland because of his unjust sentence.\n>\n> He was certain his faithless friend Ebrahim would be exposed one day,\n> and the truth would come out; the traitor would violate other tribal\n> rules, and would eventually be recognized for the thief and liar that\n> he was. If Selim ever saw him again, he would challenge Ebrahim to a\n> fight to the death, and honor would win out.\n>\n> Perhaps the tribe would applaud him, since no one in even the grandest\n> fire poems had ever braved a giant sandworm and lived. Maybe the\n> saucy, dark-eyed young Zensunni women would look at Selim with bright\n> smiles. Dust-covered but with his head held high, he would stand\n> before stern Naib Dhartha and demand readmittance to the community. To\n> have ridden a desert demon and *lived!*\n>\n> But, though Selim had already managed to survive longer than he had\n> ever hoped, the outcome was by no means assured. What was he to do\n> now?\n>\n> Beneath him, the worm made peculiar, agitated noises, an invertebrate\n> sound beyond the loud whisper of hot sand. The weary beast shuddered,\n> and a tremor ran down its sinuous body. Selim could smell flint and an\n> overpowering aroma of spice. Friction-induced furnaces burned inside\n> the worm's gullet, like the depths of Sheol itself.\n>\n> As lemony dawn tinged the sky, the worm became more unruly and\n> desperate. It thrashed about, trying to dig itself into the sand, but\n> Selim wouldn't permit that. The monster slammed its blunt head into a\n> dune, smashing a dust spray into the air. The youth had to throw all\n> of his body weight against the spear, digging into the raw, exposed\n> worm segment.\n>\n> \"You are as sore and exhausted as I am, aren't you, Shaitan?\" he said\n> in a voice as thin and dry as paper. *Almost exhausted unto death*.\n>\n> Selim didn't dare let go. The moment he dropped off onto the barren\n> dunes, the sandworm would turn about and devour him. He had no choice\n> but to keep driving the creature. The ordeal seemed endless.\n>\n> As daylight grew brighter, he noticed a faint haze on the far horizon,\n> a distant storm with winds bearing flakes of sand and dust. But the\n>\n> disturbance was far away, and Selim had other concerns.\n>\n> At last, the demon worm ground itself to a halt not far from a ridge\n> of rocks, and refused to move. With a final convulsion, it slumped its\n> serpentine head onto a dune crest and lay like a slain dragon,\n> quivering . . . then went utterly still.\n>\n> Selim trembled with absolute weariness, fearing this was some kind of\n> final trick. The monster might be waiting for him to drop his guard so\n> it could swallow him up. Could a sandworm be devious? Was it truly\n> Shaitan?*Or did I ride it to death?*\n>\n> Gathering his energy, Selim straightened. His cramped muscles\n> trembled. He could barely move. Joints were numb; nerves prickled as\n> they awakened with the creeping fire of restored circulation. At last,\n> risking all, he yanked the metal spear from the pink flesh between the\n> callused segments.\n>\n> The worm didn't even twitch.\n>\n> Selim slid down the rounded bulk and hit the sand running. His boots\n> pumped up little dust clouds as he raced across the undulating\n> landscape. The far-off rocks were black mounds of safety protruding\n> from golden dunes.\n>\n> He refused to look behind him and ran on, gasping. Each breath was\n> like dry fire in his throat. His ears tingled, anticipating the hiss\n> of sand, the rippling approach of the vengeful creature. But the\n> sandworm remained still.\n>\n> Filled with desperate energy, Selim sprinted for half a kilometer.\n> Reaching the rock barricade, he scrambled up and finally allowed\n> himself to collapse. Drawing his knees against his chest, he sat\n> gazing out into the wash of daylight, watching the worm.\n>\n> It never moved. *Is Shaitan playing a trick? Is Buddallah testing me?*\n>\n> By now Selim was very, very hungry. He shouted at the sky, \"If you\n> have saved me for some purpose, then why not offer a bit of food?\" In\n> the extremity of his exhaustion, he began to chuckle.\n>\n> *One does not make demands of God*.\n>\n> Then he realized that there was food, of a sort. In his flight to the\n> rock sanctuary, Selim had crossed a thick ochre patch of spice, veins\n> of melange like those the Zensunni sometimes found when they ventured\n> onto the sands. They gathered the substance, using it as a food\n> additive and stimulant. Naib Dhartha kept a small stockpile within the\n> cave warrens, occasionally brewing from it a potent spice beer, which\n> the tribe members consumed on special occasions and traded at the\n> Arrakis City spaceport.\n>\n> He sat in the uncertain shade for nearly an hour, looking for any sign\n> of movement from the monster. Nothing. The day became hotter, and the\n> desert lapsed into a sluggish silence. The distant storm seemed to\n> move no closer. Selim felt as if the world itself was holding its\n> breath.\n>\n> Then, growing brash again--- after all, he had ridden Shaitan!---\n> Selim crawled down from the rocks and scurried out to the patch of\n> melange. There, he raised a wary gaze in the direction of the ominous\n> hulk.\n>\n> Standing in the rust-hued sand, he scrabbled with his hands, scooping\n> up the dry red powder. He gobbled it, spat out a few grains of sand,\n> and immediately felt the stimulant of raw spice, a large quantity to\n> take all at once. It made him dizzy, gave him an explosion of energy.\n>\n> Finally sated, he stood at a distance from the flaccid worm, hands on\n> his hips, glaring. Then he waved his arms, shouting into the utter\n> silence, \"I defeated you, Shaitan! You meant to eat me, old crawler,\n> but I conquered you instead!\" He waved his hands again. \"Can you hear\n> me?\"\n>\n> But he detected not even a flicker. Euphoric from the melange and\n> foolishly brave, he marched back toward the long sinuous body that lay\n> on the dune crest. Only a few footsteps away, he stared up into the\n> face. Its cavernous\n>\n> mouth was studded with glittering internal thorns. The long fangs\n> looked like the tiniest of hairs in relation to the creature's immense\n> size.\n>\n> Now the dust storm approached, accompanied by skirling hot breezes.\n> The wind seized grains of sand and fragments of rock, whipping them\n> against his face like tiny darts. Gusts stole around the curved\n> carcass of the worm with a whispery, hooting sound. It seemed as if\n> the ghost of the beast was *daring him*, prodding him forward. The\n> spice thrummed in Selim's bloodstream.\n>\n> Boldly, he strode to the worm's maw and peered into the black infinity\n> of its mouth. The hellish friction-fires inside were cold; not even an\n> ember remained.\n>\n> He shouted again, \"I killed you, old crawler. I am Worm Slayer.\" The\n> sandworm did not respond even to this provocation.\n>\n> He looked up at the daggerlike fangs, curved shards that lined the\n> wide, smelly mouth. Buddallah seemed to be urging him on, or maybe it\n> was simply his own desire. Moving before common sense could catch up\n> with him, Selim climbed over the lower lip of the worm and reached the\n> nearest sharp tooth.\n>\n> The young outcast grabbed it with both hands, feeling how hard it was,\n> a material even stronger than metal. He twisted and wrenched. The\n> worm's body was soft, as if the tissues of its throat were losing\n> integrity. With a suppressed grunt, Selim uprooted the fang. It was as\n> long as his forearm, curved and pure and glistening with milky\n> whiteness. It would make an excellent knife.\n>\n> He staggered back out, holding his prize, utterly terrified at the\n> realization of what he had done. An unprecedented act, as far as he\n> knew. Who else would have risked not only riding Shaitain, but\n> stepping into its maw? His body trembled to its core. He couldn't\n> believe what he had dared--- and accomplished! No other person on all\n> of Arrakis possessed a treasure such as this tooth-knife!\n>\n> Although the remaining crystalline fangs hung down like stalactites,\n> hundreds of them that he could sell in the Arrakis City spaceport (if\n> he could ever find the place again), he felt suddenly weak. The rush\n> of the melange he'd consumed was beginning to fade.\n>\n> He scrambled backward onto the soft sand. The storm was almost on top\n> of him now, reminding him of his Zensunni desert survival training. He\n> must make his way back to the rocks and find some sort of shelter, or\n> he too would soon lie dead upon the dunes, a victim of the elements.\n>\n> But he no longer thought that would happen. *I have a destiny now, a\n> mission from Buddallah . . . if only I can understand it*.\n>\n> He backed away, then turned and ran toward the line of rocks, cradling\n> the fang in his hands. The wind nudged him onward as if anxious to get\n> him away from the carcass.\n>\n> *Humans tried to develop intelligent machines as secondary reflex\n> systems, turning over primary decisions to mechanical servants.\n> Gradually, though, the creators did not leave enough to do for\n> themselves; they began to feel alienated, dehumanized, and even\n> manipulated. Eventually humans became little more than decisionless\n> robots themselves, left without an understanding of their natural\n> existence.*\n\n--- TLALOC,\n\n*Weaknesses of the Empire*\n\n> **A**gamemnon was not eager to face Omnius. Having already lived more\n> than a thousand years, the cymek general had learned to be patient.\n>\n> As patient as a machine.\n>\n> Following their secret rendezvous near the red dwarf star, he and his\n> fellow Titans reached Corrin after an interstellar voyage of nearly\n> two months. The robotic fleet had arrived days before, delivering the\n> battle images captured by the watcheyes. The evermind already knew\n> about the defeat. All that remained was for Omnius to issue rebukes\n> and reprimands, especially to Agamemnon, who had been in command.\n>\n> As he landed his ship under the blazing giant sun of Corrin, the cymek\n> general reached out with his sensor network, accepting data through\n> his thoughtrodes. Omnius would be waiting, as always, after a mission.\n>\n> Perhaps by now the evermind would have accepted the failure.\n>\n> A false hope, Agamemnon knew. The all-pervasive computer did not react\n> in the manner of a human.\n>\n> Before emerging from his ship, the Titan general chose an efficient\n> mobile body, little more than a streamlined cart that carried his\n> brain canister and life-support systems connected to the framework.\n> The cymek moved out\n>\n> onto the paved boulevards under the enormous baleful eye of the red\n> giant.\n>\n> Harsh crimson light washed the flagstoned streets and white facades.\n>\n> Millennia ago, the bloated star had expanded, growing so large that\n> its outer layers swallowed the inner planets of the system. Corrin\n> itself had once been a frozen outlying world, but the increased heat\n> from the swollen giant now made the planet habitable.\n>\n> After the atmosphere thawed and the icy seas boiled away, Corrin's\n> landscape became a blank slate on which the Old Empire established a\n> colony during its younger, ambitious days. Most of the ecosystem had\n> been transplanted from elsewhere, but even after thousands of years\n> Corrin still seemed an *unfinished* world, missing many of the\n> ecological details necessary for a thriving planet. Omnius and his\n> independent robot Erasmus liked the place because it seemed new and\n> unburdened by the baggage of history.\n>\n> Agamemnon trundled along the streets, followed by hovering watcheyes\n> that monitored him like electronic guard dogs. With surveillance\n> monitors and speakers throughout the city, the evermind could have\n> conferred with him anywhere on Corrin. Omnius, however, insisted on\n> receiving the cymek general in a lavish central pavilion built by\n> human slave labor. This pilgrimage of contrition was part of\n> Agamemnon's penance for the Salusa failure. The powerful computer\n> understood the concept of dominance.\n>\n> The electrafluid surrounding his brain churned blue as Agamemnon\n> prepared to defend himself against a rigorous interrogation. His\n> mobile body passed under tall arches supported by scrolled white-metal\n> columns. Eccentric and earnest, the robot Erasmus had copied\n> ostentatious trappings from historical records of human empires. The\n> awesome gateway was designed to make visitors tremble, though the\n> Titan doubted Omnius cared about such things.\n>\n> The cymek general halted at the center of a courtyard where fountains\n> trickled from gaps in the walls. Tame sparrows flitted about the eaves\n> and\n>\n> nested atop the pillars. Inside terra cotta urns, scarlet lilies\n> bloomed in violent explosions of petals.\n>\n> \"I have arrived, Lord Omnius,\" Agamemnon announced through his voice\n> synthesizer--- a mere formality, because he had been closely observed\n> since emerging from his ship. He waited.\n>\n> In the echoing pavilion, the mirror-faced Erasmus was nowhere to be\n> seen. Omnius wanted to upbraid his general without the curious\n> scrutiny of the independent and annoying robot. Though Erasmus fancied\n> that he understood human emotions, Agamemnon doubted the eccentric\n> machine would show even a glimmer of compassion.\n>\n> The voice boomed from a dozen speakers in the walls, like an angry\n> deity. No doubt the effect was intentional. \"You and your cymeks have\n> failed, General.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon already knew how the discussion would play out--- as did\n> Omnius. Surely the evermind himself had run simulations. Yet, this was\n> a dance that must be continued.\n>\n> \"We fought hard, but could not achieve victory, Lord Omnius. The\n> *hrethgir* put up an unexpectedly fierce defense and were surprisingly\n> willing to sacrifice their city rather than let the shield generators\n> fall. As I have said many times, feral humans are dangerously\n> unpredictable.\"\n>\n> Omnius responded without hesitation. \"You have repeatedly insisted\n> that cymeks are far superior to the human vermin, combining the best\n> advantages of machine and man. How, then, could you be rebuffed by\n> such untrained, uncivilized creatures?\"\n>\n> \"In this instance, I was in error. The humans realized our true\n> objective faster than we had anticipated.\"\n>\n> \"Your forces did not fight hard enough,\" Omnius said.\n>\n> \"Six neo-cymeks were destroyed. The gladiator body of the Titan Xerxes\n> was demolished, and he barely escaped in a launch pod.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, but the remainder of your cymeks survived. A mere twenty-one\n> percent loss does not equate with 'fighting to your fullest.'\" Around\n> the courtyard, chirping sparrows flitted about, oblivious to the\n> tension between Omnius and his top military officer. \"You should have\n> been willing to sacrifice all your cymeks to bring down the scrambler\n> shields.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon was glad he no longer displayed human expressions, which the\n> computer mind might be able to interpret. \"Lord Omnius, cymeks are\n> irreplaceable *individuals*, unlike your robotic thinking machines. In\n> my estimation, risking the loss of your most vital Titans was not a\n> reasonable exchange for one insignificant planet infested with feral\n> humans.\"\n>\n> \"Insignificant? Before the mission you emphasized the extreme\n> importance of Salusa Secundus to the League of Nobles. You claimed\n> that its fall would precipitate a complete collapse of free humanity.\n> *You* were in command.\"\n>\n> \"But is the League itself worth the obliteration of your remaining\n> Titans? We created you, established the foundation for your\n> Synchronized Worlds. The Titans should be used for more than cannon\n> fodder.\" Agamemnon was curious as to how the evermind would respond to\n> this line of reasoning. Perhaps by setting up the Titans to fall in\n> battle against feral humans, Omnius planned to bypass the choke-hold\n> of Barbarossa's protective programming.\n>\n> \"Let me ponder that,\" Omnius said. Screens on the pavilion walls\n> projected watcheye images from the battle on Zimia. \"The *hrethgir*\n> are smarter than you presumed. They saw your target. You made an error\n> in judgment thinking your cymeks would be able to push forward\n> easily.\"\n>\n> \"I miscalculated,\" Agamemnon admitted. \"The humans have a clever\n> military commander. His unexpected decisions allowed them to mount a\n> successful resistance. Now, at least, we have tested their scrambler\n> fields.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon's explanations rapidly degenerated into a succession of\n> rationalizations and excuses. Omnius analyzed and dismissed them,\n> leaving the Titan feeling bare and humiliated.\n>\n> In the serene courtyard, bright flowers bloomed and birds sang.\n> Trickling fountains added their musical sounds . . . and Agamemnon\n> contained his outrage within himself. Even his sensitive mechanical\n> body showed no sign of agitation. A thousand years ago, he and his\n> fellow Titans had controlled these damnable thinking machines. *We\n> created you, Omnius. One day, we will also destroy you.*\n>\n> While it had taken the visionary Tlaloc and his group of rebels only a\n> few years to conquer the sleepy Old Empire, Omnius and his thinking\n> machines proved to be a far superior adversary, never sleeping, always\n> watching. But even machines made mistakes. Agamemnon just needed to\n> exploit them.\n>\n> \"Is there anything else, Lord Omnius?\" he interrupted. Further\n> arguments and excuses would serve no purpose. Above all else, machines\n> craved efficiency.\n>\n> \"Only my next set of instructions, Agamemnon.\" The Omnius voice moved\n> from speaker to speaker, giving the impression that he was everywhere\n> at once. \"I am dispatching you and your Titans back to Earth. You will\n> accompany Erasmus, who intends to continue his studies of captive\n> humans there.\"\n>\n> \"As you command, Lord Omnius.\" Though surprised, Agamemnon showed no\n> reaction. *Earth* . . . a very long journey. \"We will determine other\n> ways to destroy this blight of humanity. The Titans exist only to\n> serve you.\"\n>\n> It was one of the few advantages of Agamemnon's human side: Even\n> though the evermind was filled with a vast quantity of data, Omnius\n> did not know how to recognize a simple lie.\n>\n> *From a certain perspective, defense and offense encompass nearly\n> identical tactics.*\n\n--- XAVIER HARKONNEN,\n\nraddress to Salusan Militia\n\n> **N**ew duties, new responsibilities . . . and more good-byes. As a\n> mostly recovered Xavier Harkonnen stood with Serena Butler inside the\n> Zimia Spaceport, the departure facility seemed a sterile environment\n> with echoing plaztile floors. Even the warmth of Serena's expression\n> did not compensate for the utilitarian structure. Window walls looked\n> out onto the fused pavement where shuttles took off and landed every\n> few minutes, going to and from the larger long-distance ships that\n> waited in orbit.\n>\n> In one wing of the spaceport, work crews shored up sections of a\n> hangar damaged during the cymek attack. Large cranes lifted temporary\n> walls and braces into place. Out on the landing field, huge blast\n> craters had been filled in.\n>\n> Dressed in a crisp gold-and-black Armada uniform reflecting his new\n> grade, Xavier gazed deeply into Serena's unusual lavender eyes. He\n> knew how she saw him. His facial features were not particularly\n> striking--- ruddy complexion, pointed nose, generous lips--- but\n> overall she found him attractive, especially the soft brown eyes and\n> his infectious, though rarely used, smile.\n>\n> \"I wish we could spend more time together, Xavier.\" She fingered a\n> white rose floweret on her lapel. The spaceport drone of other people,\n> noisy repair crews and heavy machinery surrounded them.\n>\n> Xavier noticed Serena's younger sister Octa watching them. A\n> seventeen-year-old with long strawberry-blond hair, she'd always had a\n> crush on Xavier. Willowy Octa was a nice enough girl, but recently he\n> wished she would give him and Serena a little more privacy, especially\n> now that they would be apart for so long.\n>\n> \"So do I. Let's make these minutes count.\" Surrendering to the urge he\n> knew they both shared, he leaned forward to kiss her, as if his lips\n> were drawn by a magnetic force. The kiss lingered, then grew intense.\n> At last Xavier pulled back. Serena looked disappointed, more with the\n> situation than with him. They both had important duties, demands on\n> their time and energy.\n>\n> Newly installed in his position, Xavier was about to embark with a\n> group of military specialists on an inspection tour of League\n> planetary defenses. After the nearly successful cymek strike against\n> Salusa two months ago, he would make certain there were no weaknesses\n> on other League Worlds. The thinking machines would exploit the\n> tiniest flaw, and free humans could not afford to lose any of their\n> remaining strongholds.\n>\n> Serena Butler, meanwhile, would focus on expanding the League domain.\n> After the battlefield surgeons had been so successful with the fresh\n> tank-grown organs provided by Tuk Keedair, Serena had spoken\n> passionately about the services and resources the Unallied Planets\n> such as Tlulaxa could provide. She wanted them to formally join the\n> union of free humans.\n>\n> Already, more flesh merchants had arrived on Salusa with their\n> biological wares; previously, many nobles and League citizens had been\n> uneasy about the mysterious outsiders, but now that the war-wounded\n> faced terrible losses of limbs and organs, they were willing to accept\n> cloned replacement parts. The Tlulaxa never explained where they had\n> developed or obtained such sophisticated biological technology, but\n> Serena praised their generosity and resources.\n>\n> At any other time, her speech in the Hall of Parliament might have\n> been forgotten, but the cymek attack had underscored her point about\n> the vulnerability of the Unallied Planets. What if the machines next\n> chose to wipe out the Thalim system and thereby eliminate the Tlulaxan\n> ability to give sight to blind veterans, new limbs to amputees?\n>\n> She had studied hundreds of survey documents and ambassadorial\n> reports, trying to determine which of the nonsignatory planets were\n> the best\n>\n> candidates for induction into the League brotherhood. Unifying the\n> remnants of humanity had become her passion, to make the free people\n> strong enough to put down any machine aggression.\n>\n> Despite her youth, she had already led two successful aid missions,\n> the first when she was only seventeen. In one she had taken food and\n> medical supplies to refugees from an abandoned Synchronized World, and\n> in the other she had provided relief for a biological blight that\n> almost destroyed the pristine farms on Poritrin.\n>\n> Neither she nor Xavier had time for themselves.\n>\n> \"When you return, I promise I will make it up to you,\" she said, her\n> eyes dancing. \"I'll give you a banquet of kisses.\"\n>\n> He allowed himself a rare laugh. \"Then I plan to arrive very hungry\n> indeed!\" Xavier took her hand and kissed it gallantly. \"When we dine\n> again, I shall come calling with flowers.\" He knew their next\n> rendezvous could be months away.\n>\n> She gave him a warm smile. \"I have a particular fondness for flowers.\"\n>\n> He was about to pull Serena close, but they were interrupted by a\n> familiar brown-skinned child coming from another direction--- Xavier's\n> eight-year-old brother, Vergyl Tantor. The boy had been permitted to\n> leave school to see him off. Breaking free of an elderly instructor\n> escort, Vergyl ran to hug his idol, nuzzling his face into the crisp\n> uniform shirt.\n>\n> \"Take care of our estate while I am gone, little brother,\" Xavier\n> said, playfully rubbing his knuckles on the boy's wiry hair. \"You are\n> in charge of tending my wolfhounds--- you understand?\"\n>\n> The boy's brown eyes widened, and he nodded gravely. \"Yes.\"\n>\n> \"And obey your parents, otherwise you can't hope to grow up to become\n> a good officer in the Armada.\"\n>\n> \"I will!\"\n>\n> An announcement summoned the inspection team to board the shuttle.\n> Hearing it, Xavier promised to bring something back for Vergyl, Octa,\n> and Serena. While Octa watched from a distance, smiling hopefully, he\n> hugged his little brother again, squeezed Serena's hand, and strode\n> off with the officers and engineers.\n>\n> Staring at the window wall where they could watch the waiting military\n> shuttle, Serena glanced down at the boy and thought of Xavier\n> Harkonnen. Xavier had been only six years old when thinking machines\n> had killed his natural parents and his older brother.\n>\n> Because of interfamily agreements and the written wills of Ulf and\n> Katarina Harkonnen, young Xavier had been raised as the foster son of\n> powerful and then-childless Emil and Lucille Tantor. The noble couple\n> had already made arrangements for their holdings to be administered by\n> Tantor relatives, distant cousins and nephews who would not normally\n> have inherited anything. But when Emil Tantor began to raise Xavier,\n> he was quite taken with the orphan and legally adopted him, though\n> Xavier retained his Harkonnen name and all associated noble rights.\n>\n> After the adoption, Lucille Tantor unexpectedly conceived a son,\n> Vergyl, who was twelve years younger than Xavier. The Harkonnen heir,\n> not worried about dynastic politics, concentrated on a course of\n> military studies, intending to join the League Armada. At the age of\n> eighteen Xavier received the legal entitlement to the original\n> Harkonnen holdings, and a year later he became an officer in the\n> Salusan Militia. With his impeccable performance and rapid promotions,\n> everyone could see Xavier was a rising star in the military ranks.\n>\n> Now three people who cared about him watched the shuttle lift into the\n> sky on a plume of orange exhaust. Vergyl held Serena's hand, bravely\n> trying to comfort her. \"Xavier will be all right. You can count on\n> him.\"\n>\n> She felt a pang for her departing love, but smiled warmly at the\n> wide-eyed boy. \"Of course we can.\"\n>\n> She would have it no other way. Love was one of the things that\n> separated humans from machines.\n>\n> *The answer is a mirror of the question.*\n\n--- COGITOR KWYNA,\n\nCity of Introspection archives\n\n> **T**he temporary meeting chamber for the League delegates had\n> originally been the home of the first Viceroy, Bovko Manresa. Before\n> the Titans had taken over the weak Old Empire, Manresa had built the\n> mansion on then-isolated Salusa Secundus as a way of celebrating\n> wealth garnered from his planetary land dealings. Later, when refugee\n> humans began arriving, driven out by the cruel rule of the Twenty\n> Titans, the big house had become a meeting hall, with chairs and a\n> lectern set up in the grand ballroom, as they were today.\n>\n> Months ago, within hours of the cymek attack, Viceroy Butler had stood\n> on a pile of rubble beneath the broken central dome of the Hall of\n> Parliament. While the poisonous dust settled in the streets and fires\n> still blazed in damaged buildings, he had vowed to repair the\n> venerable old facility that had served the League for centuries.\n>\n> The governmental edifice was more than just a building: It was\n> hallowed ground on which legendary leaders had debated great ideas and\n> formulated plans against the machines. The damage to the roof and\n> upper floors was severe, but the basic structure remained sound. Just\n> like the human spirit it represented.\n>\n> It was a frosty morning outside, with fog on the windows. Leaves on\n> the hills had begun to turn lovely autumn shades of yellow, orange,\n> and brown. Serena and the representatives came inside the temporary\n> meeting hall, still clinging to their coats.\n>\n> She gazed at the walls of the crowded old ballroom, at paintings of\n> long-dead leaders and depictions of past victories. She wondered what\n> the future would bring, and what her place might be in it. She wanted\n> so badly to *do* something, to help in the great crusade of humankind.\n>\n> Most of her life she had been an activist, always willing to get her\n> hands dirty, to assist in aiding the victims of other tragedies such\n> as natural disasters or machine attacks. Even during pleasant times,\n> she had joined the work crews of harvesters to pick grapes from the\n> Butler estate vineyards or olives from the gnarled groves.\n>\n> She took a seat in the first row, then watched as her soft-featured\n> father made his way across the wood parquet floor to the antique\n> lectern. Viceroy Butler was followed by a monk in a red-velvet tunic\n> carrying a large plexiplaz container that held a living human brain in\n> viscous electrafluid. The monk lovingly placed the container on an\n> ornate table beside the lectern, then stood beside it.\n>\n> From her front-row seat, Serena saw the pinkish gray tissue undulate\n> slightly within the pale-blue life-support liquid. Separated from the\n> senses and distractions of the physical world for more than a\n> millennium, stimulated by constant intense contemplation, the female\n> Cogitor's once-human brain had grown larger than its original size.\n>\n> \"The Cogitor Kwyna does not often leave the City of Introspection,\"\n> Viceroy Butler said, sounding both formal and excited. \"But in these\n> times we require the best thoughts and advice. If any mind can\n> understand the thinking machines, it will be Kwyna's.\"\n>\n> These esoteric disembodied philosophers were seen so infrequently that\n> many League representatives did not understand how they managed to\n> communicate. Compounding the mystery that surrounded them, Cogitors\n> rarely said much, choosing instead to marshall their energies and\n> contribute only the most important thoughts.\n>\n> \"The Cogitor's Secondary will speak for Kwyna,\" the Viceroy said, \"if\n> she has any insights to offer.\"\n>\n> Beside the brain canister, the red-robed monk removed the sealed lid,\n> exposing the agitated viscous fluid. Blinking his round eyes rapidly,\n> he stared into the tank. Slowly, the monk slid one naked hand into the\n> soup, immersing his fingers. He closed his eyes, drawing deep breaths,\n> as he\n>\n> tentatively touched the convoluted brain. His brows furrowed with\n> concentration and acceptance as the electrafluid soaked into his\n> pores, linking the Cogitor with the Secondary's neural system, using\n> him as an extension in much the same way cymeks used artificial\n> mechanical bodies.\n>\n> \"I understand nothing,\" said the monk in a strange, distant voice.\n> Serena knew that was the first principle the Cogitors adopted, and the\n> contemplative brains spent centuries in deep study, adding to that\n> sense of nothingness.\n>\n> Centuries before the original Titans, a group of spiritual humans had\n> enjoyed studying philosophy and discussing esoteric issues, but too\n> many frailties and temptations of the flesh inhibited their ability to\n> concentrate. In the ennui of the Old Empire, these metaphysical\n> scholars had been the first to have their brains installed in\n> life-support systems. Freed of biological constraints, they spent all\n> their time learning and thinking. Each Cogitor wanted to study the\n> entirety of human philosophy, bringing together the ingredients to\n> understand the universe. They lived in ivory towers and contemplated,\n> rarely bothering to note the superficial relationships and events of\n> the mundane world.\n>\n> Kwyna, the two-thousand-year-old Cogitor who resided in Salusa's City\n> of Introspection, claimed to be politically neutral. \"I am ready to\n> interact,\" she announced through the monk, who stared with glazed eyes\n> at the assembly. \"You may begin.\"\n>\n> With intense blue eyes, Viceroy Butler gazed around the packed\n> ballroom, pausing to look at a number of faces, including Serena's.\n> \"My friends, we have always lived under the threat of annihilation,\n> and now I must ask every one of you to devote your time, energies, and\n> money to our cause.\"\n>\n> He gave tribute to the tens of thousands of Salusans who had died in\n> the cymek onslaught, along with fifty-one visiting dignitaries. \"The\n> Salusan Militia remains on full alert here, and messenger ships have\n> been dispatched to all League Worlds, warning them of the danger. We\n> can only hope that no other planets were attacked.\"\n>\n> The Viceroy then called upon Tio Holtzman, recently arrived after\n> nearly a month in transit from his laboratories on Poritrin. \"Savant\n> Holtzman, we are anxious to hear your assessment of the new defenses.\"\n>\n> Holtzman had been eager to inspect his orbital scrambler fields, to\n> see how they might be modified and improved. On Poritrin, the\n> flamboyant nobleman Niko Bludd funded the Savant's research. Given his\n> past accomplishments, League members always held out the hope that\n> Holtzman would pull some other miracle out of his pocket.\n>\n> Slight of body, Holtzman moved with grace and an enormous stage\n> presence, wearing clean and stylish robes. The iron gray hair that\n> hung to his shoulders was square-cut, framing a narrow face. A man of\n> immense confidence and ego, he loved to speak to important dignitaries\n> in the Parliament, but now he appeared uncharacteristically troubled.\n> In truth, the inventor could not bring himself to admit a mistake.\n> Unquestionably, his scrambler network had failed. The cymeks had\n> broken through! What would he say to these people who had relied on\n> him?\n>\n> Reaching the speaking platform, the great man cleared his throat and\n> looked around, glancing oddly at the imposing presence of the Cogitor\n> and the looming attendant monk. This was a most delicate matter. How\n> could he shift the blame from himself?\n>\n> The scientist used his best voice. \"In warfare, whenever one side\n> makes a technological breakthrough, the other attempts to top it. We\n> recently witnessed this with my atmospheric scrambler fields. Had they\n> not been installed here, the full thinking machine fleet would have\n> laid waste to Salusa. Unfortunately, I did not factor in the unique\n> abilities of the cymeks. They found a chink in the armor and\n> penetrated it.\"\n>\n> No one had accused him of lax work or poor planning, but this was the\n> closest Holtzman would come to admitting that he had overlooked a\n> major flaw. \"Now it is our turn to surpass the machines with a new\n> concept. I hope to be inspired by this tragedy, pushing my creativity\n> to its limits.\" He then\n>\n> stalled and looked embarrassed, even endearing. \"I'll be working on\n> that, as soon as I get back to Poritrin. I hope to have a surprise for\n> you very soon.\"\n>\n> A tall, statuesque woman glided toward the lectern, drawing attention\n> to herself. \"Perhaps I have a suggestion.\" She had pale eyebrows,\n> white hair, and luminous skin that made her seem ethereal, but charged\n> with power.\n>\n> \"Let us hear from the women of Rossak. I gladly yield to Zufa Cenva.\"\n> Looking relieved, Holtzman hurried back to his seat and slumped into\n> it.\n>\n> The pale woman carried an air of mystery about her; she wore glowing\n> jewelry on a black, diaphanous gown that revealed much of her perfect\n> body. Pausing at the Cogitor's life-support case, Zufa Cenva peered\n> inside at the enlarged brain. Her brow furrowed as she concentrated,\n> and as she did so, the brain itself seemed to vibrate; the\n> electrafluid swirled, bubbles formed. Alarmed, the devout attendant\n> monk withdrew his hand from the liquid.\n>\n> The tall woman relaxed, satisfied, and stepped to the podium. \"Because\n> of oddities in our environment, many of the females born on Rossak\n> exhibit enhanced telepathic abilities.\" Indeed, the powerful\n> Sorceresses of the dense, barely habitable jungles had parlayed their\n> mental quirks into political influence. Rossak men exhibited no such\n> telepathic enhancements.\n>\n> \"The League of Nobles was formed a thousand years ago for our mutual\n> defense, first against the Titans and then against Omnius. Since then,\n> we have barricaded ourselves, trying to protect our worlds from the\n> enemy.\" Her eyes flashed like highly polished stones. \"We need to\n> rethink this strategy. Perhaps it is time for *us* to take the\n> offensive against the Synchronized Worlds. Otherwise, Omnius and his\n> minions will never leave us alone.\"\n>\n> The League representatives muttered at this, looking fearful,\n> especially after the devastation Zimia had just endured. The Viceroy\n> was first to respond. \"That is a bit premature, Madame Cenva. I'm not\n> sure we have the capability.\"\n>\n> \"We barely survived the last attack!\" a man shouted. \"And we had only\n> a handful of cymeks to contend with.\"\n>\n> Manion Butler looked deeply concerned. \"Confronting Omnius would be a\n> suicide mission. What weapons would we use?\"\n>\n> In response, the imposing woman squared her shoulders and spread her\n> hands, while closing her eyes and concentrating. Although Zufa was\n> known to have extrasensory powers, she had never before displayed them\n> in Parliament. Her milky pale skin seemed to heat up with an inner\n> light. The air in the enclosed chamber stirred, and static electricity\n> crackled around the assemblage, making hair stand on end.\n>\n> Lightning flickered at her fingertips, as if she were holding a barely\n> contained thunderstorm inside herself. Her own white hair coiled and\n> writhed like snakes. When Zufa's eyes opened again, a dazzling energy\n> seemed ready to shoot out of them, as if the universe lived behind her\n> pupils.\n>\n> Gasps echoed through the delegates. Serena's skin crawled and her\n> scalp tingled, as if a thousand poisonous spiders skittered over her\n> mind. In her preservation tank, the Cogitor Kwyna churned.\n>\n> Then Zufa relaxed, throttling back the chain reaction of mental\n> energy. Letting out a long, cold breath, the Sorceress smiled grimly\n> at the startled onlookers. \"*We* have a weapon.\"\n>\n> *The eyes of common perception do not see far. Too often we make the\n> most important decisions based only on superficial information.*\n>\n> --- NORMA CENVA,\n\nunpublished laboratory notebooks\n\n> **A**fter delivering her announcement to the League assembly, Zufa\n> Cenva returned to Rossak. She had been in transit for weeks, and her\n> shuttle now landed on a dense section of the jungle canopy that had\n> been paved over with a polymer to seal and fuse the branches and\n> leaves into a solid mass. To enable the trees to receive adequate\n> moisture and gas exchange, the polymer was porous, synthesized from\n> jungle chemicals and organics.\n>\n> Toxic oceans made the native Rossak planktons, fish, kelp, and sea\n> creatures poisonous to humans. Rugged, sterile lava plains covered\n> much of the planet's land area, dotted with geysers and brimstone\n> lakes. Since the botanical chemistry did not rely on chlorophyll, the\n> general cast of all plants was silvery purple; nothing here was fresh\n> and green.\n>\n> In a tectonically stable zone girdling the equator, large rifts in the\n> continental plate created broad sanctuary valleys where the water was\n> filtered and the air breathable. In these protected rift ecosystems,\n> hardy human settlers had constructed sophisticated cave-cities like\n> hives tunneled into the black cliffs. The declivitous external walls\n> were overgrown with silvery-purple vines, drooping ferns, and fleshy\n> moss. Comfortable chambers looked out upon a thick jungle canopy that\n> pressed against the settlement cliffs. People could venture directly\n> onto the upper rubbery branches and descend to the dense underbrush,\n> where they harvested edibles.\n>\n> As if to make up for the dearth of life elsewhere on Rossak, the rift\n> valleys teemed with aggressive living things--- mushrooms, lichens,\n> berries, flowers, orchidlike parasites, and insects. The Rossak men,\n> lacking the telepathic enhancement of their women, had turned their\n> talents to developing and extracting drugs, pharmaceuticals, and\n> occasional poisons\n>\n> from nature's larder. The entire place was like a Pandora's box that\n> had been opened only a crack. . . .\n>\n> Now the tall, luminous Sorceress watched as her much younger paramour,\n> Aurelius Venport, crossed a suspended bridge from the open cliffs to\n> the foamy purple treetops. His patrician features were handsome, his\n> dark hair curly, his face long and lean. Tagging along behind him on\n> stubby legs came Zufa's disappointing fifteen-year-old daughter by a\n> prior relationship.\n>\n> *Two misfits. No wonder they get along so well*.\n>\n> Prior to seducing Aurelius Venport, the chief Sorceress had arranged\n> conjugal relationships with four other men during her peak breeding\n> times, selecting them for their proven bloodlines. After generations\n> of research, miserable miscarriages, and defective offspring, the\n> women of Rossak had compiled detailed genetic indices of various\n> families. Because of heavy environmental toxins and teratogens, the\n> odds were against any child being born strong and healthy. But for\n> every stillborn monster or talentless male, a miraculous pale-skinned\n> Sorceress might occur. Each time a woman conceived a child, it was\n> like playing a game of roulette. Genetics was never an exact science.\n>\n> But Zufa had been so careful, checking and double-checking the\n> bloodlines. Only one of those conjugal encounters had resulted in a\n> living child--- Norma, a dwarf barely four feet tall, with blocky\n> features, mousy brown hair, and a tedious, bookish personality.\n>\n> Many offspring on Rossak had defective bodies, and even the apparently\n> healthy ones rarely exhibited the strong mental powers of the elite\n> Sorceresses. Nevertheless, Zufa felt deep disappointment, even\n> embarrassment, that *her* daughter had no telepathic skills. The\n> greatest living Sorceress should have been able to pass along her\n> superior mental abilities, and she desperately wanted her daughter to\n> carry on the fight against the machines. But Norma showed no potential\n> whatsoever. And despite Aurelius Venport's impeccable genetic\n> credentials, Zufa had never been able to carry one of his babies to\n> term.\n>\n> *How many more times must I keep trying before I replace him with\n> another breeder?* Once more, she decided--- she would attempt to get\n> pregnant again, within the next few months. It would be Venport's last\n> chance.\n>\n> Zufa was also disappointed in Norma's independence and defiance. Too\n> often the teenager spun off on obscure mathematical tangents that no\n> one could comprehend. Norma seemed lost in her own world.\n>\n> *My daughter, you should have been so much more!*\n>\n> No one had a heavier burden of responsibility than the small clan of\n> Sorceresses on the planet, and Zufa's burden was the greatest of all.\n> If only she could count on everyone else, especially in light of this\n> latest danger from the cymeks.\n>\n> Since stunted Norma could never take part in the mental battle, Zufa\n> had to concentrate on her daughters in spirit, those few young women\n> who had won the \"genetic lottery\" and acquired superior mental\n> abilities. Zufa would train and encourage them, showing them how to\n> eradicate the enemy.\n>\n> From her cliffside perch, she watched her lover Aurelius and young\n> Norma reach the other side of the suspension bridge and begin to\n> negotiate a circular network of ladders that led to the deeply\n> shadowed jungle floor. Like two happy-go-lucky outcasts, Norma and\n> Aurelius had grown close emotionally, using one another as crutches.\n>\n> Engrossed in their own petty concerns that had nothing to do with\n> victory, neither of them had even noticed Zufa's return on the\n> shuttle. No doubt the two misfits would spend hours poking through the\n> foliage in search of new drug resources, which Aurelius would\n> incorporate into his business ventures.\n>\n> The Sorceress shook her head, not understanding his priorities. Those\n> drugs the men developed were of little more use than Norma's arcane\n> mathematics. Admittedly, Aurelius was a highly intelligent and skilled\n> businessman, but what good were enormous profits if free humanity was\n> doomed to enslavement?\n>\n> Disappointed in both of them, knowing that she and her Sorceresses\n> would have to do the real fighting, Zufa set out to find the most\n> powerful young women she had recruited to learn the devastating new\n> technique she planned to unleash against the cymeks.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AS NORMA FOLLOWED him through the fleshy underbrush, Aurelius consumed\n> capsules of a focused stimulant that his expert chemists had\n> synthesized from the pungent pheromones of a boulder-sized burrowing\n> beetle. Venport felt stronger, his perceptions sharpened, his reflexes\n> enhanced. Not quite like the telepathic powers of icy Zufa, but better\n> than his natural abilities.\n>\n> Someday he would make a breakthrough, allowing him to meet the\n> powerful Sorceress on his own terms. Maybe he and Norma would do it\n> together.\n>\n> Aurelius maintained a benign fondness for the girl's stern mother. He\n> tolerated Zufa's moods and scornful attitude with good grace; Rossak\n> women rarely allowed themselves the luxury of romantic love.\n>\n> Though Aurelius knew full well that Zufa had selected him for his\n> breeding potential, he saw through the woman's stoic, demanding\n> exterior. Attempting to conceal her weaknesses, the powerful Sorceress\n> showed her doubts on occasion, afraid that she could not fulfill the\n> responsibilities she had placed on herself. Once, when Aurelius\n> commented that he knew how strong she was trying to be, Zufa had grown\n> embarrassed and angry. \"Somebody has to be strong\" was all she had\n> said.\n>\n> Since he lacked telepathic ability, Zufa had little interest in\n> engaging him in conversation. Perhaps she recognized his skills as a\n> businessman, investor, and politician, but she valued none of those\n> abilities as much as her own narrow goals. The Sorceress frequently\n> tried to make him feel like a failure, but her derision only served to\n> ignite his ambition, especially his desire to find a drug that would\n> give him telepathic powers equivalent to her own.\n>\n> There were other ways to fight a war.\n>\n> The silvery-purple jungles offered a treasure-trove to cure diseases,\n> expand the mind, and improve human abilities. The choices were\n> overwhelming, but Aurelius sought to investigate everything. From\n> proper development and marketing, the products of Rossak had already\n> put him on the path to great wealth. He was even grudgingly respected\n> by a number of the Sorceresses--- except by his own mate.\n>\n> As a visionary entrepreneur, he was accustomed to exploring\n> alternatives. Like paths through a dense jungle, many routes could\n> lead to the same place. Sometimes, one just had to hack through with a\n> machete.\n>\n> So far, though, the right drug eluded him.\n>\n> In another venture, he had proudly distributed Norma's exotic\n> mathematical work among scholarly scientific circles. Though he didn't\n> understand her theorems, he had a gut feeling that she might come up\n> with something important. Maybe she had already done so, and it took\n> expert eyes to recognize it. Venport liked the intense girl, acting as\n> a big brother to her. As far as he was concerned, Norma was a\n> mathematical prodigy, so who cared about her height or her appearance?\n> He was willing to give her a chance, even if her mother never would.\n>\n> Beside him, Norma studied the design of a broad purple leaf, using a\n> light-beam caliper to measure its various dimensions and the\n> relationships among angles in the sap-filled veins. The depth of her\n> concentration added a wistful cast to her plain features.\n>\n> Glancing back at him, Norma said in a surprisingly mature voice, \"This\n> leaf has been designed and constructed by the Earth mother Gaia, or\n> the Master Creator God, or Buddallah, or whatever you want to call\n> it.\" With blunt fingers, she held up the fleshy leaf and passed a beam\n> of light through it, so that the intricate cellular designs showed\n> clearly. \"Patterns within patterns, all tied together in complex\n> relationships.\"\n>\n> In his drug-enhanced, euphoric state, Aurelius found the design\n> hypnotic. \"God is in everything,\" he said. The stimulant he had taken\n> seemed to supercharge his synapses. He squinted through the\n> illuminated fabric of the leaf as she pointed to the internal shapes.\n>\n> \"God is the mathematician of the universe. There is an ancient\n> correlation known as the Golden Mean, a pleasing ratio of form and\n> structure that is found in this leaf, in seashells, and in the living\n> creatures of many planets. It is the tiniest part of the key, known\n> since the time of the Greeks and Egyptians of Earth. They used it in\n> their architecture and pyramids, in their Pythagorean pentagram and\n> Fibonacci sequence.\" She discarded the leaf. \"But there is so much\n> more.\"\n>\n> Nodding, Venport touched a moistened fingertip to a pouch of fine\n> black powder at his belt; he rubbed the powder under the sensitive\n> tissue of his tongue and felt another drug penetrating his senses,\n> merging with the remnants of the last one. Norma kept talking; though\n> he did not follow her logical development, he was certain the\n> revelations must be fabulous.\n>\n> \"Give me a practical example,\" he slurred. \"Something with a function\n> that I can understand.\"\n>\n> He had grown accustomed to Norma spouting off obscure formulations.\n> Her basis might have been in classical geometry, but she applied her\n> knowledge in much more complex ways. \"I can envision calculations all\n> the way to infinity,\" she said, as if in a trance. \"I don't have to\n> write them down.\"\n>\n> *And she doesn't even need mind-enhancement drugs to accomplish it,*\n> Aurelius marveled.\n>\n> \"At this very moment I envision a huge and efficient structure that\n> could be built at a reasonable cost, tens of kilometers long--- and\n> based upon the ratio of the Golden Mean.\"\n>\n> \"But who would ever need something so immense?\"\n>\n> \"I cannot peer into the future, Aurelius.\" Norma teased him. Then they\n> trudged deeper into the weird jungle, still curious and intent on what\n> they might discover. Norma's face was radiant with energy. \"But there\n> might be something . . . something I haven't thought of yet.\"\n>\n> *Careful preparations and defenses can never guarantee* *victory.*\n>\n> *However, ignoring these precautions is an almost certain recipe for\n> defeat.*\n>\n> ---*League Armada Strategy Manual*\n>\n> **F**or four months, Tercero Xavier Harkonnen and his six Armada\n> survey vessels traveled along a predetermined route, stopping to\n> inspect and assess the military facilities and defensive preparations\n> of the League Worlds. After many years of no more than a few\n> skirmishes, no one knew where Omnius might strike next.\n>\n> Xavier had never wavered from the difficult decision he'd made during\n> the cymek attack on Zimia. The Viceroy had praised him for his nerve\n> and determination; even so, Manion Butler had wisely sent the young\n> officer away during the major rebuilding activities, giving Salusans\n> time to heal their wounds without looking for a scapegoat.\n>\n> Xavier listened to no excuses from tightwad nobles unwilling to commit\n> the necessary resources. No expense must be spared. Any free world\n> that fell to machine aggression would be a loss for the entire human\n> race.\n>\n> The survey ships traveled from the mines of Hagal to the broad river\n> plains of Poritrin, then made their way to Seneca where the weather\n> was poor and the rain so corrosive that even thinking machines would\n> break down soon after a conquest.\n>\n> The League planets of Relicon followed, then Kirana III, then Richese,\n> with its burgeoning high-tech industries that made so many other\n> League noblemen uneasy. In theory, the sophisticated manufacturing\n> devices contained no computerization or artificial intelligence, but\n> there were always questions, always doubts.\n>\n> Finally Xavier's team arrived at their final inspection stop, Giedi\n> Prime. At last, his tour was about to end. He could return home, see\n> Serena again, and they could make good on their promises to each\n> other. . . .\n>\n> All other League Worlds had installed scrambler field towers. The\n> shields' known weakness against cymeks did not completely devalue\n> Holtzman's ingenious work, and the costly barriers still provided\n> substantial protection against all-out thinking machine offensives. In\n> addition, every human world had long ago built up enormous stockpiles\n> of atomics as part of a doomsday defense. With so many nuclear\n> warheads, an iron-willed planetary governor could turn his world into\n> slag rather than allowing it to fall to Omnius.\n>\n> Although the thinking machines also had access to atomics, Omnius had\n> concluded that atomics were an inefficient and nonselective way to\n> impose control, and radioactive cleanup afterward was difficult.\n> Besides, with unlimited resources and a deep reservoir of patience,\n> the relentless evermind had no need of such weapons.\n>\n> Now, as Xavier disembarked from the lead survey ship at the Giedi City\n> spaceport, he blinked under bright sunlight. The well-maintained\n> metropolis sprawled in front of him, with its habitation complexes and\n> productive industrial buildings amid manicured parks and canals. The\n> colors were bright and fresh, and flowers bloomed in ornate beds,\n> although with his new Tlulaxa lungs and tissues he could smell only a\n> hint of the most potent scents, even when he breathed deeply.\n>\n> \"This would be a fine place to bring Serena one day,\" he said\n> wistfully as he stood in the heat-shimmer of spaceship exhaust. If he\n> married her, perhaps this would be a suitable world for their\n> honeymoon. During the current inspection tour, he had kept his eyes\n> open, trying to find a likely spot.\n>\n> After four months in space, Xavier missed Serena terribly. He knew the\n> two of them were destined for each other. His life operated on a\n> smooth, clearly defined path. When he returned to Salusa, he promised\n> himself that he would formalize their betrothal. He saw no point in\n> waiting any longer.\n>\n> Viceroy Butler already treated him like a son, and the young officer\n> had received the blessing of his adoptive father Emil Tantor. As far\n> as Xavier\n>\n> could determine, everyone in the League agreed it would be a fine\n> joining of noble houses.\n>\n> He smiled, thinking of Serena's face, of her intriguing lavender eyes\n> . . . and then looked across the landing field to see Magnus Sumi\n> approaching the survey ships. The elected leader was accompanied by a\n> dozen members of the Giedi Prime Home Guard.\n>\n> The Magnus was a thin man in late middle age with pale skin and\n> gray-blond hair that hung to his shoulders. Sumi raised a hand. \"Ah,\n> Tercero Harkonnen! We welcome the League Armada and are eager to see\n> how Giedi Prime can improve its defenses against the thinking\n> machines.\"\n>\n> Xavier snapped a stiff bow in return. \"Your cooperation pleases me,\n> Eminence. Against Omnius, we must not use low-cost materials or\n> stopgap systems that would not adequately protect your people.\"\n>\n> After the Battle of Zimia, Xavier's corps of engineers had made\n> requests for mandatory strategic improvements throughout the League.\n> The nobles dug into their coffers, increasing taxes on their subjects\n> and spending the necessary money to build up their defenses. At each\n> stop, planet after planet, month after month, Xavier had assigned\n> teams of engineers and Armada troops where he deemed they were most\n> needed.\n>\n> Soon, though, he would be going back home. *Soon*. As the time drew\n> near, he thought of Serena more and more.\n>\n> Well dressed and well armed, the Home Guard stood at attention around\n> the survey ships. Magnus Sumi gestured for Xavier to follow him. \"I\n> look forward to clarifying everything over a sumptuous banquet,\n> Tercero Harkonnen. I've set up twelve fine courses with dancers,\n> musicians, and our best poets. You and I can relax in my government\n> residence while we discuss plans. I am certain you must be weary from\n> your journey. How long can you stay with us?\"\n>\n> Xavier could form only a tight smile, thinking of how far away he was\n> from Salusa Secundus. Even after leaving Giedi Prime, the ships would\n> still need\n>\n> another month of fast space travel to return home. The sooner he\n> departed here, the sooner he could hold Serena in his arms again.\n>\n> \"Eminence, this is the final stop on our long tour. If it pleases you,\n> I would prefer to spend less time with festivities and more on the\n> inspection.\" He gestured toward his survey ship. \"We have a schedule\n> to keep. I'm afraid I can allot only two days for Giedi Prime. It is\n> best that we concentrate on our work.\"\n>\n> The Magnus looked crestfallen. \"Yes, I suppose celebration is not\n> appropriate after the damage done to Salusa Secundus.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> FOR TWO DAYS, Xavier gave the planetary defenses a quick, almost\n> cursory inspection. He found Giedi Prime to be a dazzling and\n> prosperous world with many resources, perhaps even a suitable place to\n> settle down and start an estate of his own one day.\n>\n> He gave a favorable assessment, accompanied by a warning. \"This is\n> undoubtedly a planet the thinking machines will want to conquer,\n> Eminence.\" He studied the city blueprints and the distribution of\n> resources across the main continents. \"Any cymek attack would most\n> likely attempt to keep the industries intact so that robots could\n> exploit them. Omnius preaches efficiency.\"\n>\n> Beside him, Magnus Sumi reacted with pride. He pointed out substations\n> on the diagrams. \"We intend to install secondary field-transmitting\n> towers at several strategic points.\" As he spoke, highlights appeared\n> on the blueprint screen. \"We have already built a completely redundant\n> transmitting station on one of the uninhabited islands in the northern\n> sea, which can provide full overlap from a polar projection. We hope\n> to have it online within another month.\"\n>\n> Xavier nodded distractedly, his mind weary from months of such\n> details. \"I am glad to hear that, though I doubt a second transmitting\n> complex is entirely necessary.\"\n>\n> \"We want to feel safe, Tercero.\"\n>\n> When the two men stood under silvery parabolic towers that throbbed\n> into the sky over Giedi City, Xavier paced around the plascrete\n> embankments that blocked access to large vehicles. He had no doubt a\n> cymek warrior could easily crash through.\n>\n> \"Eminence, I suggest you station more ground troops and obstacles\n> here. Increase your planetside missile-defense batteries to protect\n> against any intrusion from space. On Salusa, the cymek strategy was to\n> focus their entire attack on the destruction of the towers, and they\n> might try that again.\" He rapped his knuckles against the tower's\n> heavy paristeel support pillar. \"These shields are your first and last\n> line of defense, your most effective blockade against thinking\n> machines. Do not neglect them.\"\n>\n> \"Indeed. Our munitions factories are building heavy artillery and\n> armored ground vehicles. As soon as possible, we intend to surround\n> this complex with a large concentration of military power.\"\n>\n> As for the uncompleted secondary generating station, it was too\n> isolated to be protected from a massive assault. But its existence\n> seemed to comfort the Magnus and his populace.\n>\n> \"Very good,\" Xavier said, then glanced at the chronometer on his\n> wrist. Everything was going so well, perhaps his survey ships could\n> depart before sunset. . . .\n>\n> The Magnus continued, his voice uncertain, \"Tercero, are you concerned\n> about Giedi Prime's limited space military defenses? Our Home Guard\n> has few large ships in orbit to drive back an approaching machine\n> fleet, and our picket ships and scouts are minimal. I admit to feeling\n> vulnerable in that area. What if Omnius attacks us directly from\n> orbit?\"\n>\n> \"You have ground-based missile defenses in place, and they have always\n> proved reliable.\" Impatient, Xavier looked up into the clear sky. \"I\n> believe your best hope is to protect your shield complex here on the\n> ground. No quantity of Armada battleships can match the deterrent\n> power of scrambler\n>\n> shields. When the robot fleet attacking Salusa realized they could not\n> take down the scramblers, they retreated.\"\n>\n> \"But what if they blockade Giedi Prime from orbit?\"\n>\n> \"Your world is self-sufficient enough to wait out any siege until the\n> arrival of a League rescue force.\" Anxious to be back at the\n> spaceport, Xavier decided to appease the governor. \"Nevertheless, I\n> will recommend that a javelin-class destroyer or two be stationed\n> around Giedi Prime.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THAT EVENING, THE Magnus threw a departure banquet for the Armada\n> service performed on his behalf. \"Someday,\" he said, \"we may all thank\n> you for our lives.\"\n>\n> Xavier excused himself midway through the meal. The food and wine\n> seemed to lack taste. \"My apologies, Eminence, but my squadron must\n> not miss the optimal departure window.\" He bowed at the doorway, then\n> hurried to his vessel. Some of his troops would have liked to remain\n> longer, but most were also eager to get home. They had their own\n> sweethearts and families, and these soldiers had more than earned\n> furloughs.\n>\n> With his inspection tour behind him, Xavier left lovely Giedi Prime,\n> confident that he had seen and done everything necessary.\n>\n> And completely unaware of the vulnerabilities he had not bothered to\n> discover. . . .\n>\n> *In the process of becoming slaves to machines, we transferred\n> technical knowledge to them--- without imparting proper value\n> systems.*\n\n--- PRIMERO FAYKAN BUTLER,\n\n*Memoirs of the Jihad*\n\n> **T**he *Dream Voyager* neared Earth, humanity's original home and now\n> the central Synchronized World.

A circle has no end.\"\n>\n> \"Earth-Omnius is the beginning and the end.\"\n>\n> \"You're too literal. That's why I beat you in so many strategy games.\"\n>\n> \"Only forty-three percent of the time, young man,\" Seurat corrected.\n> He activated the exit ramp.\n>\n> \"Around half.\" Vorian headed toward the hatch, anxious to get outside\n> and breathe fresh air. \"Not bad for someone susceptible to illnesses,\n> distractions, physical weaknesses, and any number of other frailties.\n> I'm gaining ground on you, too, if you care to examine trends.\" He\n> bounded down to the sprawling field of fused plascrete.\n>\n> Loader robots scurried among larger pieces of AI equipment that moved\n> about on glider fields.

At the core of its\n> artificial body hung the protected brain jar that contained the mind\n> of an ancient human general.\n>\n> The cymek swiveled its turret sensors, as if targeting him, then\n> altered its path toward Vor, raising its front grappling arms. Heavy\n> pincers clacked.\n>\n> Vorian waved and rushed forward. \"Father!\"\n>\n> Since cymeks regularly exchanged temporary bodies in response to the\n> physical requirements of various activities, they were difficult to\n> distinguish from each other. However, Vor's father came to see him\n> whenever the *Dream Voyager* returned from its update-delivery\n> missions.\n>\n> Many enslaved humans lived on the Synchronized Worlds, serving the\n> evermind.

Like the times described in your\n> memoirs, when Titans were in complete control.\"\n>\n> Inwardly, the cymek general frowned at the comments. Agamemnon's optic\n> threads detected numerous watcheyes floating around them as the two\n> walked. \"I do not wish for the old days, of course,\" he said,\n> presently. \"You have been reading my memoirs again?\"\n>\n> \"I never tire of your stories, Father. The Time of Titans, the great\n> Tlaloc, the First Hrethgir Rebellions . . . everything is so\n> fascinating.\" Accompanying the magnificent cymek made Vor feel\n> special. He always remained alert, within the limitations of his\n> position, for ways to better himself. He wanted to prove himself\n> worthy of the opportunities he'd been given . . . and of more. \"I\n> would be happy to learn of this new *hrethgir* defensive system,\n> Father. Perhaps I can assist you in finding a way to defeat it?\"\n>\n> \"Omnius is analyzing the data and will decide what to do. I have only\n> recently arrived back on Earth.\"\n>\n> With human ambitions still a fundamental part of their psyches, the\n> Titans always had monumental construction projects under way:\n> megalithic buildings and monuments to themselves that celebrated the\n> lost age of humanity and glorified the Time of Titans. Captive human\n> artists and\n>\n> architects were ordered to develop original designs and sketches that\n> the cymeks modified or approved.\n>\n> Nearby, machinery lifted the components of skyscraper buildings into\n> place, adding upper floors to existing complexes, though the thinking\n> machines had little need for further expansion. At times, the\n> extravagant construction seemed to Vor like mere busy-work for the\n> slaves. . . .\n>\n> He had never known his mother, and understood only that ages ago,\n> before the Titans had surgically converted themselves into cymeks,\n> Agamemnon had created his own sperm bank, from which he had germinated\n> Vorian. Over the centuries, the general could create any number of\n> offspring using acceptable surrogate mothers.\n>\n> Though he had never learned about any siblings, Vorian suspected they\n> were out there somewhere. He wondered what it would be like to meet\n> them, but in machine society, emotional attachments were not\n> practical. He only hoped that his siblings had not proven to be\n> disappointments to Agamemnon.\n>\n> When his father was off on his frequent missions, Vor often tried to\n> talk with the remaining Titans, curious about the events recorded in\n> Agamemnon's celebrated and voluminous memoirs. He used his responsible\n> position to better himself. Some of the original cymeks--- especially\n> Ajax--- were arrogant and treated Vor as a nuisance. Others, like Juno\n> or Barbarossa, found him amusing. All of them spoke with utmost\n> passion about Tlaloc, the first of the great Titans, who had sparked\n> the revolution.\n>\n> \"I wish I'd been able to meet Tlaloc,\" Vor said, trying to keep the\n> conversation going. Agamemnon loved to speak of his glory days.\n>\n> \"Yes, Tlaloc was a dreamer with ideas I had never heard before,\" the\n> cymek mused as he strode down the boulevards. \"At times he was a bit\n> na\u00efve, not always understanding the practical repercussions of his\n> ideas. But I pointed them out to him. That was why we made such a\n> great team.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon seemed to pick up speed when he spoke of the Titans. Weary\n> from trying to keep up the rapid pace, Vorian gasped for breath.\n>\n> \"Tlaloc took his name from an ancient rain god. Among the Titans,\n> Tlaloc was our visionary, while I was the military commander. Juno was\n> our tactician and manipulator. Dante watched over statistics,\n> bureaucracy, and population-accounting. Barbarossa saw to the\n> reprogramming of the thinking machines, making certain they had the\n> same goals as we did. He gave them ambition.\"\n>\n> \"And a good thing, too,\" Vorian said.\n>\n> Agamemnon hesitated, but did not voice any objections, wary of the\n> watcheyes. \"When he visited Earth, Tlaloc realized how the human race\n> had gone stagnant, how people had become so dependent on machines that\n> they had nothing left but apathy. Their goals were gone, their drive,\n> their passion. When they should have had nothing to do but unleash\n> their creative impulses, they were too lazy to perform even the work\n> of the imagination.\" His vocal speakers made a disgusted sound.\n>\n> \"But Tlaloc was different,\" Vor said, on cue.\n>\n> The cymek's voice took on more emotion. \"Tlaloc grew up in the Thalim\n> system, on an outer colony world where life was difficult, where labor\n> was not accomplished without sweat, blood, and blisters. He had to\n> fight his way and earn his position. On Earth, he saw that the human\n> spirit had all but died---*and the people hadn't even noticed!*\n>\n> \"He gave speeches attempting to rally the humans, to make them see\n> what was happening. A few watched him with interest, considering him a\n> novelty.\" Agamemnon raised one of his powerful metal arms. \"But they\n> heard his words only as a diversion. Soon the bored audiences returned\n> to their slothful, hedonistic pursuits.\"\n>\n> \"But not you, Father.\"\n>\n> \"I was dissatisfied with my uneventful life. I had already met Juno,\n> and the two of us had dreams. Tlaloc crystallized them for us. After\n> Juno and I joined him, we set in motion the events that led to the\n> downfall of the Old Empire.\"\n>\n> Father and son arrived at the central complex where the Earth-Omnius\n> resided, although redundant nodes of the evermind were distributed\n> around the planet in a network of armored vaults and high towers.\n> Vorian followed the cymek into the main structure, eager to do his\n> part. This was a ritual they had completed many times.\n>\n> The walker body strode through wide halls and entered a maintenance\n> facility filled with lubricant tubes, bubbling nutrient cylinders,\n> polished tabletops, and flickering analysis systems. Vor retrieved a\n> tool kit, then turned on vacuum hoses and high-pressure water jets,\n> found soft rags and polishing lotions. He considered it his most\n> important task as a trustee.\n>\n> In the center of the sterile room, Agamemnon halted beneath a lifting\n> apparatus. A magnetic claw-hand came down and attached itself to the\n> preservation canister that held his ancient brain. Neural connection\n> ports popped open, and thoughtrode cables spiraled away. The lifting\n> arm raised the canister, still attached to temporary batteries and\n> life-support systems.\n>\n> Vorian came forward with an armload of equipment. \"I know you can't\n> feel this, Father, but I like to think it makes you more comfortable\n> and efficient.\" He blasted the connection ports with high-pressure air\n> and streams of warm water, using a wadded cloth to polish every\n> surface. The cymek general transmitted wordless gratified murmurings.\n>\n> Vor completed the cleaning and polishing, then adjusted wires and\n> cables and hooked up diagnostics. \"All functions optimal, Father.\"\n>\n> \"With your attentive maintenance, it is no wonder. Thank you, my son.\n> You take such good care of me.\"\n>\n> \"It is my honor to do so.\"\n>\n> His synthesized voice purring, Agamemnon said, \"One day, Vorian, if\n> you continue serving me so well, I will recommend you for the greatest\n> reward. I will ask Omnius to surgically convert you into a cymek, like\n> me.\"\n>\n> At the mention of this wonderful prospect, Vorian again polished the\n> canister, then looked lovingly at the creamy contours of the brain\n> inside. He tried to hide his flush of eager embarrassment, but tears\n> came to his eyes. \"That is the best a human can hope for.\"\n>\n> *Humans, with such fragile physical forms, are easily crushed. Is it\n> any challenge to hurt or damage them?*\n\n--- ERASMUS,\n\nuncollated laboratory files\n\n> **G**azing out upon the skies of Earth again through hundreds of\n> appraising optic threads, Erasmus was not pleased. The robot stood in\n> a high bell tower of his villa, staring through a curving expanse of\n> armored windowplate. The landscape of this world, with its oceans and\n> forests and cities built upon the bones of other cities had already\n> seen countless civilizations rise and fall. The scope of history made\n> his own accomplishments seem small and contrived.\n>\n> Therefore, he would have to try harder.\n>\n> Neither Omnius nor any of his delegated architect robots understood\n> true beauty. To Erasmus, the buildings and the layout of the rebuilt\n> city resembled components with sharp angles, abrupt discontinuities. A\n> city must be more than an efficient circuit diagram. Under his\n> multiphased scrutiny, the metropolis looked like an elaborate\n> mechanism, designed and constructed with utilitarian force. It had its\n> own clean lines and systematic efficiency, which resulted in a\n> completely serendipitous beauty . . . but there was no finesse\n> whatsoever.\n>\n> It was such a disappointment when the omniscient evermind refused to\n> live up to his potential. Sometimes, gloriously unrealistic human\n> ambitions had a certain merit.\n>\n> Omnius either ignored or intentionally refuted the graceful beauty of\n> Golden Age human architecture. But such cold and petulant superiority\n> was not logical. Admittedly, Erasmus could see a certain beauty in\n> streamlined machines and components--- he rather liked his own\n> burnished platinum skinfilm, the smooth grace of his mirrored face\n> with which he formed facial\n>\n> expressions. But he saw no point in maintaining ugliness just to spite\n> a perceived enemy's concept of beauty.\n>\n> How could a vast computer mind distributed across hundreds of planets\n> exhibit even a hint of narrow-mindedness? To Erasmus, with his\n> detached and mature understanding developed through long\n> contemplation, Omnius's attitude revealed a lack of comprehensive\n> thinking.\n>\n> Making the sound of an exaggerated sigh that he had copied from\n> humans, he transmitted a thought-command that caused projection shades\n> to drop over the windows in the bell tower. Choosing his mood, he\n> projected artificial, pastoral views from other worlds. So soothing\n> and peaceful.\n>\n> On one wall he paused at a clothing synthesizer, selected the design\n> he wanted, and waited while a garment was prepared for him. A\n> traditional painter's smock. When it was ready, he draped it over his\n> sleek body and crossed the room to an easel where he had already set\n> up a blank canvas, a palette of paints, and fine brushes.\n>\n> At a wave of his hand, the projection shades shifted to display\n> enlarged images of masterpiece paintings, each one highlighting a\n> different great master. He selected \"Cottages at Cordeville\" by an\n> ancient Earth artist, Vincent Van Gogh. It was bold and colorful but\n> basically crude in its implementation, with inept lines and childish\n> pigment applications that featured thick globs of paint and smears of\n> color. Yet when considered as a whole, the painting itself possessed a\n> certain raw energy, an indefinable primitive vibrancy.\n>\n> After deep concentration, Erasmus thought he had a delicate\n> understanding of Van Gogh's technique. But the comprehension of *why*\n> anyone would want to create it in the first place eluded him.\n>\n> Although he had never painted before, he copied the artwork exactly.\n>\n> Brushstroke for brushstroke, pigment for pigment. When he was\n> finished,\n>\n> Erasmus examined his masterpiece. \"There, the sincerest form of\n> flattery.\"\n>\n> The nearest wall-mounted screen brightened to a pale gray wash of\n> light. Omnius had been watching, as always. Erasmus would no doubt\n> have to justify his activities, since the evermind would never\n> understand what the independent robot was doing.\n>\n> He studied the painting again. Why was it so hard to understand\n> creativity? Should he just change some of the components at random and\n> call it an original work? As the robot finished his scrutiny,\n> satisfied that he had made no mistakes, that he had not deviated from\n> the tolerances he could see in the image of the painting, Erasmus\n> waited for a rush of comprehension.\n>\n> Slowly, he came to realize that what he had just completed was not\n> really *art*, any more than a printing press created literature. He\n> had only *copied* the ancient composition in every detail. He had\n> added nothing, synthesized no newness. And he burned with the need to\n> understand the difference.\n>\n> Frustrated, Erasmus took a different tack. In an implacable voice, he\n> summoned three servants and ordered them to carry his painting\n> supplies out to one of the laboratory buildings. \"I intend to create a\n> new work of art, all my own. A still life, of sorts. You three will be\n> vital parts of the process. Rejoice in your good fortune.\"\n>\n> In the sterile environment of the laboratory, with the cold assistance\n> of his personal robot guards, Erasmus proceeded to vivisect the trio\n> of victims, oblivious to their screams. \"I want to get to the heart of\n> the matter,\" he quipped, \"the lifeblood of it.\"\n>\n> With stained metal hands he studied the dripping organs, squeezed\n> them, watched their juices flow and cellular structures collapse. He\n> performed a cursory analysis, discovering sloppy mechanics and\n> inefficient circulatory systems that were unnecessarily complex and\n> prone to failure.\n>\n> Then, feeling a vibrant energy, an *impulsiveness*, Erasmus set up a\n> tableau to paint. A new work, completely unique! It would be his own\n> arrangement, and he would tint the images using different filters,\n> making a few intentional mistakes to better approximate human\n> imperfection and uncertainty.\n>\n> At last, he must be on the right track.\n>\n> At his command, the sentinel robots brought in a vat filled with\n> fresh, uncoagulated human blood. Erasmus began removing the\n> interesting array of human organs--- still warm to the touch--- from\n> his table, and instructed two cleaning drones to scrape out the\n> insides from the donor bodies. Contemplating the arrangement and\n> order, he dropped organ after organ into the blood and watched them\n> bob in the liquid--- eyes, livers, kidneys, hearts.\n>\n> Slowly assessing each step of the process, he set up exactly what his\n> \"creative urges\" told him to do. Whim upon whim. Erasmus added more\n> ingredients to the grisly stew. Pursuant to something he had learned\n> about the artist Van Gogh, he sliced an ear off one of the corpses and\n> tossed it into the vat as well.\n>\n> Finally, his metal hands dripping gore, he stepped back. A beautiful\n> arrangement--- one that was totally original to him. He could think of\n> no famous human artist who had worked on such a canvas. No one else\n> had ever done anything approaching this.\n>\n> Erasmus wiped his smooth metallic hands and began to paint upon a\n> virgin canvas. On the blank medium, he astutely drew one of the three\n> hearts, showing in perfect detail the ventricals, auricles, and aorta.\n> But this was not meant to be a realistic dissection image.\n> Dissatisfied, he smeared some of the lines to add an artistic flair.\n> True art required the right amount of uncertainty, just as gourmet\n> cooking needed the proper spices and flavors.\n>\n> This must be how creativity worked. As he painted, Erasmus tried to\n> imagine the kinesthetic relationship between his brain and his\n> mechanical fingers, the thought impulses that set the fingers into\n> motion.\n>\n> \"Is *that* what the humans define as art?\" Omnius said from a\n> wallscreen.\n>\n> For once, Erasmus did not debate with the evermind. Omnius was correct\n> in his skepticism. Erasmus had not attained true creativity. Yes, he\n> had produced an original and graphic arrangement. But in human\n> artwork, the\n>\n> sum of the components added up to more than the individual items. Just\n> ripping organs from victims, floating them in blood, and painting them\n> brought him no closer to understanding human inspiration. Even if he\n> manipulated the details, he remained imprecise and uninspired.\n>\n> Still, this might be a step in the right direction.\n>\n> Erasmus could not carry this thought to the next logical step, and he\n> came to understand why. The process was not ratiocinative at all.\n> Creativity and the precision of analysis were mutually exclusive.\n>\n> Frustrated, the robot gripped the macabre painting in his powerful\n> hands, broke the frame, and tore the canvas to shreds. He would have\n> to do better than this, much better. Erasmus shifted his metallic\n> polymer face to a stylized pensive mask. He was no closer to\n> comprehending humans, despite a century of intensive research and\n> musings.\n>\n> Walking slowly, Erasmus went to his private sanctuary, a botanical\n> garden where he listened to classical music piped through the cellular\n> structures of plants. \"Rhapsody in Blue,\" by a composer of Old Earth.\n>\n> In the contemplative garden, the troubled robot sat in the ruddy\n> sunlight and felt warmth on his metal skin. This was another thing\n> that humans seemed to enjoy, but he did not understand why. Even with\n> his sensory enhancement module, it just seemed like *heat*.\n>\n> And machines that overheated broke down.\n>\n> *The tapestry of the universe is vast and complex, with infinite\n> patterns. While threads of tragedy may form the primary weave,\n> humanity with its undaunted optimism still manages to embroider small\n> designs of happiness and love.*\n>\n> --- COGITOR KWYNA,\n\nCity of Introspection archives\n\n> **A**fter his long sojourn in space, Xavier could think only of being\n> home, and back in the warm embrace of Serena Butler.\n>\n> On furlough, he returned to the Tantor estate where he was welcomed by\n> his adoptive parents and their enthusiastic son Vergyl. The Tantors\n> were a soft-spoken older couple, gentle and intelligent, with dark\n> skin and hair the color of thick smoke. Xavier seemed to be cut from\n> the same mold, with similar interests and high moral values. He had\n> grown up in this warm and spacious manor house, which he still\n> considered home. Though he had legally inherited other Harkonnen\n> holdings--- mining and industrial operations on three planets--- many\n> rooms in the Tantor mansion were still set aside for his use.\n>\n> As he entered his familiar large suite, Xavier found a pair of shaggy\n> gray wolfhounds awaiting him, wagging their tails. He dropped his bags\n> and wrestled with the dogs. The animals, larger than his little\n> brother, were always playful and delighted to see him.\n>\n> That evening, the family feasted on the cook's specialty of sage fowl\n> roasted with honey, slivered nuts, and olives from the Tantors' own\n> groves. Unfortunately, after his exposure to the cymeks' searing gas,\n> the subtle nuances of flavors and aromas now eluded him. The cook gave\n> him an alarmed look when he dumped salt and seasoning--- which he\n> needed to taste anything at all--- onto the delicate food.\n>\n> Another thing the thinking machines had taken from him.\n>\n> Afterward, Xavier lounged in a heavy oak chair before a roaring fire,\n> sipping a red wine from the Tantor family vineyards--- also,\n> unfortunately, nearly tasteless. He luxuriated in relaxing at home,\n> away from military protocol. He had spent almost half a year aboard\n> the efficient but bare-bones Armada survey ships; tonight he would\n> sleep like a babe in his own bedchamber.\n>\n> One of the gray wolfhounds snored loudly, resting a furry muzzle on\n> Xavier's stockinged feet. Emil Tantor, with a fringe of smoky hair\n> around his bald crown, sat in the chair opposite his adopted son. Emil\n> asked about the strategic positions of the Synchronized Worlds and the\n> military capabilities of the Armada. \"What are the chances of the war\n> escalating after the attack on Zimia? Can we ever do more than drive\n> them back?\"\n>\n> Xavier finished his wine, poured another half glass for himself and a\n> full one for the older man, then sat back in the chair again, all\n> without disturbing the gray dog. \"The situation looks grim, Father.\"\n> Barely remembering his own parents, he had always called the Tantor\n> lord his father. \"But, then, it has always looked grim, ever since the\n> Time of Titans. Perhaps we lived too comfortably in the days of the\n> Old Empire. We forgot how to be ourselves, how to live up to our\n> potential, and for a thousand years afterward we've paid the price. We\n> were easy prey--- first for evil men, then for soulless machines.\"\n>\n> Emil Tantor sipped his wine, and stared into the fireplace. \"So is\n> there hope, at least? We must have something to cling to.\"\n>\n> Xavier's lips formed a gentle smile. \"We are human, Father. As long as\n> we hold onto that, there is always hope.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THE NEXT DAY Xavier sent a message to the Butler estate, asking\n> permission to accompany the Viceroy's daughter on the annual\n> bristleback hunt, scheduled in two days. Serena would already know\n> that Xavier had returned. His survey ships had arrived with much\n> fanfare, and Manion Butler would have been expecting his note.\n>\n> Still, Salusan society was formal and extravagant. In order to court\n> the beautiful daughter of the Viceroy, one had to bow to certain\n> expectations.\n>\n> In late morning a messenger pounded on the doors of the Tantor manor\n> house; Vergyl stood beside his big brother, grinning when he saw the\n> expression on Xavier's face. \"What is it? Can I come along? Did the\n> Viceroy say yes?\"\n>\n> Xavier made a mock-stern expression. \"How could he possibly turn down\n> the man who saved Salusa Secundus from the cymeks? Remember that,\n> Vergyl, if you ever wish to win the affections of a young lady.\"\n>\n> \"I need to save a *planet* just to have a girlfriend?\" The boy sounded\n> skeptical, though wary of outright disbelief when it came to Xavier's\n> words.\n>\n> \"For a woman as magnificent as Serena, that is exactly what you must\n> do.\" He strode into the great house to tell the Tantors his plans.\n>\n> The next dawn, Xavier dressed in his finest equestrian outfit and rode\n> into brightening daylight toward the Butler property. He borrowed his\n> father's chocolate-brown Salusan stallion, a fine beast with a braided\n> mane, narrow muzzle, and bright eyes. The animal's ears were large,\n> and its gait flowed without the jarring rhythm of less conditioned\n> horses. On the crest of a grassy hill stood a cluster of ornate\n> whitewashed buildings--- a main house, stables, servants' quarters,\n> and storage sheds arranged as outbuildings along the perimeter of a\n> split-rail fence. As his horse climbed, he saw impressive vistas of\n> the white spires of Zimia far behind him.\n>\n> A path paved with crushed limestone wound up to the crest. The gravel\n> crunched under the stallion's hooves as Xavier rode, breathing the\n> crisp air. He could feel the moist chill of early spring, saw fresh\n> leaves on the trees, a dazzle of wildflowers in their first bloom. But\n> each breath he drew into his new lungs smelled flat.\n>\n> Grapevines lined the hill like green corduroy, carefully tended and\n> watered, each vine tied to cables between stakes so that the clusters\n> would hang off the ground for easy picking. Twisted olive trees\n> surrounded the main house,\n>\n> their low branches awash with white flowers. Each year, the first\n> pressings of grapes and olives were cause for feasting in every\n> Salusan household; local vineyards vied against each other to see\n> which could produce the best vintages.\n>\n> As Xavier rode through the gates and into the courtyard, other\n> horsemen in hunting outfits milled about. Barking dogs dodged around\n> the stallion's legs, but the chocolate-brown horse stood majestically,\n> ignoring the hounds as if they were ill-mannered little boys.\n>\n> Contract huntsmen grabbed the leashes and pulled the dogs back into\n> order. A number of short black hunting horses pranced about, as\n> impatient as the dogs. Two of the huntsmen whistled loudly and others\n> joined them, ready to begin the day's festivities.\n>\n> Manion Butler strolled out of the stables, calling up his team like a\n> military commander positioning troops for battle. He glanced at the\n> young officer, raised a hand in greeting.\n>\n> Then Xavier saw Serena riding out on a gray mare with beautiful lines\n> and an ornate saddle. She wore high boots, jodhpurs, and a black\n> riding jacket. Her eyes were like electric sparks as her gaze met his.\n>\n> She cantered over to where Xavier sat astride his mount, a smile\n> forming at the edges of her mouth. Even with all the barking dogs,\n> restless horses, and shouting huntsmen, Xavier wanted to kiss her so\n> badly that he could barely restrain himself. Yet Serena remained\n> coolly formal, extending a gloved hand in greeting. He took it,\n> holding her fingertips.\n>\n> How he wished he could be telepathic like the Sorceresses of Rossak,\n> just to send her his thoughts. But from the obvious delight suffusing\n> her face, he thought Serena understood his feelings well enough, and\n> reciprocated them.\n>\n> \"The journeys across space were so long,\" he said. \"And I thought\n> about you all the time.\"\n>\n> \"*All* the time? You should have been concentrating on your duties.\"\n> She gave him a skeptical smile. \"Perhaps we can find time alone during\n> today's hunt, and you will tell me what you dreamed of.\"\n>\n> Playfully, she urged her gray mare to trot over to where her father\n> waited. Conscious of the eyes watching them, she and Xavier maintained\n> an acceptable distance. He rode forward and clasped her father's\n> black-gloved hand. \"I thank you for allowing me to participate in the\n> hunt, Viceroy.\"\n>\n> Manion Butler's florid face rearranged itself into a grin. \"I'm glad\n> you could join us, Tercero Harkonnen. This year I'm certain we'll\n> track down a bristleback. The beasts are definitely in these woods---\n> and I, for one, have been craving hams and roasts. And bristlebacon,\n> especially. There's nothing like it.\"\n>\n> Her eyes dancing, Serena looked at him. \"Perhaps, Father, if you\n> brought along fewer barking dogs, galloping horses, and men crashing\n> through the underbrush, some of those shy animals would be easier to\n> find.\"\n>\n> In response, Manion smiled as if she were still a precocious little\n> girl. Glancing at Xavier, he said, \"I'm glad you'll be there to\n> protect her, young man.\"\n>\n> The Viceroy raised his right arm. Horns sounded and a brass gong\n> clanged from the stables. The purebred hounds began to bay, clustering\n> toward the far fence. Ahead, the path led beyond the blossoming olive\n> groves and into the scrubby Salusan forest. Two eager-eyed boys swung\n> open the gates, already anticipating their first bristleback hunt.\n>\n> The party rode out like a rowdy gang, dogs pushing first through the\n> gates, followed by the big horses that carried the professional\n> huntsmen. Manion Butler rode with them, blowing an antique bugle that\n> had been with his family since Bovko Manresa's first settlement on\n> Salusa.\n>\n> The followers rode lesser mounts, hurrying behind the horses. These\n> helper crews would set up camp and dress and skin whatever wild game\n> the\n>\n> huntsmen caught. They would also prepare the feast once the party\n> returned to the main house.\n>\n> The hunters had already spread out, with each chief taking a point and\n> plunging into the outskirts of the forest. Unhurried, Xavier and\n> Serena trotted toward the dark green woods. One bright-eyed young man,\n> trailing behind, glanced over his shoulder and winked at Xavier, as if\n> he knew that the young couple had no intention of enjoying the hunt\n> for its own sake.\n>\n> Xavier urged his stallion forward. Serena rode beside him, and they\n> chose their own path through thinning trees to a muddy streambed wet\n> with spring flow. Smiling secretively at each other, they listened to\n> the distant sounds of dogs and her father's continuing bugle blasts.\n>\n> The Butler's private forest covered hundreds of acres, crisscrossed by\n> game trails. Mostly it was left as a preserve, with meadows and\n> sparkling creeks, nesting birds, and lush patches of flowers that\n> bloomed in successive splashes of color as the patches of crusty snow\n> faded.\n>\n> Xavier was simply happy to be alone with Serena. Riding side by side,\n> they brushed arms and shoulders, intentionally. He would reach up to\n> hold green branches away from her face, and Serena pointed out birds\n> and small animals, identifying them.\n>\n> In his comfortable hunting outfit, Xavier carried a sheathed\n> ceremonial dagger, a bullwhip, and a Chandler pistol that shot\n> jacketed crystal fragments. Serena carried her own knife and a small\n> pistol. But neither of them expected to bring down any prey. To them,\n> their hunt was for each other, and both knew it.\n>\n> Serena chose her path without hesitation, as if she had spent time\n> during Xavier's survey mission riding through the forest in search of\n> places where they could be alone. Finally, she led him through a stand\n> of dark pines to a meadow with tall grasses, starlike flowers, and\n> thick reeds taller than her head. The reeds surrounded a mirror-smooth\n> pond, a shallow old tarn created by winter snow melt and refreshed by\n> an underground spring.\n>\n> \"The water has bubbles in it,\" she said. \"It tingles your skin.\"\n>\n> \"Does that mean you want to go for a swim?\" Xavier's throat tightened\n> at the prospect.\n>\n> \"It'll be cold, but the spring has some natural heat. I'm willing to\n> risk it.\" With a smile, Serena dismounted and let her mare graze. She\n> heard a splash out in the pond, but the reeds blocked their view.\n>\n> \"Sounds like a lot of fish, too,\" Xavier said. He slid down from his\n> stallion, patted the muscular neck, and let his mount sniff at the\n> thick grasses and flowers near the gray mare.\n>\n> Serena pulled off her riding boots and stockings, then lifted her\n> loose jodhpurs above her knees as she walked barefoot into the rushes.\n> \"I'm going to test the water.\" She pushed the hollow grasses aside.\n>\n> Xavier checked the fastenings on his stallion's saddle. He worked open\n> one of the leather compartments and brought out a bottle of fresh\n> citrus water to share. He followed Serena toward the reeds, already\n> imagining how it would be to swim beside her, just the two of them\n> stroking naked through this lonely forest lake, kissing each other. .\n> . .\n>\n> Without warning, a monstrous bristleback charged out of the reeds,\n> spraying mud and water from its cool wallowing hole. Serena let out a\n> cry, more of alarm than terror, and fell backward into the mud.\n>\n> The bristleback pawed at the rushes with its cloven hooves. Long tusks\n> protruded from a squarish snout, each a bony maul for uprooting\n> saplings and eviscerating enemies. The animal had wide-set eyes, large\n> and black. It made loud grunts as if preparing to breathe fire. In\n> tales of great bristleback hunts, many men, hunting dogs, and horses\n> had died--- but there were so few of the animals anymore.\n>\n> \"Into the water, Serena!\"\n>\n> The bristleback turned as it heard his shout. Serena did exactly as\n> Xavier said, splashing away from the rushes, deeper into the pond. She\n> began to swim, knowing the boar could not charge her if she was in\n> deep enough water.\n>\n> The bristleback stomped out of the rushes. The two horses squealed and\n> skittered back toward the edge of the meadow.\n>\n> \"Look out, Xavier!\" Waist deep now, Serena drew her hunting knife, but\n> knew she couldn't help him.\n>\n> Xavier planted his legs firmly, held a knife in one hand and the\n> Chandler pistol in the other. Without flinching, he aimed the\n> crystal-shard weapon and shot the bristleback three times in the face.\n> The sharp projectiles tore through the animal's cheek and forehead,\n> gouging the thick skull. Another shot splintered one of the tusks. But\n> the bristleback kept charging toward him, caught up in its own\n> solitary stampede.\n>\n> Xavier fired twice more. The mangled creature bled profusely, mortally\n> wounded--- but even imminent death did not diminish its momentum. As\n> the beast thundered toward him, Xavier jumped to one side and slashed\n> the sharp knife across its throat, opening jugular and carotid\n> vessels. The bristleback turned, gushing blood upon him even as its\n> heart began to fade.\n>\n> The weight of the falling creature knocked Xavier to the ground, but\n> he wrestled it away, avoiding the convulsive thrusts of the razor\n> tusks. The killing done, Xavier climbed back to his feet and staggered\n> away, shivering in shock. His hunting outfit was soaked with the\n> beast's blood.\n>\n> He sprinted into the trampled rushes at the edge of the water.\n> \"Serena!\" \"I'm all right,\" she called, splashing toward the shore.\n>\n> He looked at his reflection in the placid pond, saw his shirt and face\n> covered with gore. He hoped none of it was his own. He cupped his\n> hands and splashed cool water on his skin, then dunked his head to\n> wash the stink from his hair. He scrubbed his hands with peaty sand.\n>\n> Serena came to him, her clothes drenched, wet hair clinging to her\n> skull. She used a corner of her riding jacket to dab the blood from\n> his neck and cheeks. Then she opened his shirt, wiping his chest as\n> well.\n>\n> \"I don't have a scratch on me,\" he said, not sure if it was true. The\n> skin on one side of his neck felt raw and hot, as if chafed, and his\n> chest was sore from the collision with the attacker. He clutched her\n> arm, pulling her closer. \"Are you sure you're not hurt? You aren't\n> cut, no bones broken?\"\n>\n> \"You're asking me?\" she said with teasing disbelief. \"*I'm* not the\n> brave boar fighter here.\"\n>\n> Serena kissed him. Her lips were cold from the water, but he held them\n> against his own, awakening her touch with his until their mouths\n> opened slightly, their breath warm inside each other as the kiss\n> deepened. He took her from the edge of the pond, through the rushes,\n> and to the soft meadow grass, far from the dead bristleback.\n>\n> The young lovers stroked the wet hair away from their ears and eyes,\n> and kissed again. The brush with death made them feel intensely alive.\n> Xavier's skin was hot, and his heart kept pounding, even though the\n> danger was past. A new excitement mounted. He wished he could better\n> enjoy the seductive scent of her perfume, but could detect only a\n> tantalizing thread.\n>\n> Serena's sodden clothes were cold, and Xavier noticed goosebumps on\n> her pale arms. All he could think to do was to remove the wet fabric.\n> \"Here, let me warm you.\"\n>\n> She helped him unfasten the black riding jacket and her blouse while\n> her own fingers worked at his bloodstained shirt. \"Just to make\n> certain you're not hurt,\" Serena said. \"I don't know what I would have\n> done if you'd been killed.\" Her words came fast and hard between\n> kisses.\n>\n> \"It takes more than a wild boar to keep me away from you.\"\n>\n> She yanked his shirt down over his shoulders and fumbled with his cuff\n> so she could take it off entirely. The meadow was soft and lush.

His concepts and achievements sparked dreams and\n> fostered confidence in human technological capabilities against the\n> thinking machines.\n>\n> The mantra had also been picked up by his patron, Lord Niko Bludd, and\n> by representatives in the League of Nobles. Early in his career,\n> Holtzman had realized that it was not always the best scientists who\n> received the accolades or funding. Instead, it was the best *showmen*,\n> the most effective politicians.\n>\n> To be sure, Savant Holtzman was an adequate scientist. He had an\n> exceptional technical background and had achieved marked success with\n> his inventions and weapons systems, all of which had been put to good\n> use against Omnius. But he had arranged for more publicity and\n> attention than the inventions themselves warranted. Through his\n> oratory skills and by coloring certain details, he had constructed a\n> pedestal of fame on which he now stood. Holtzman had made himself into\n> the Hero of Poritrin, rather than just another nameless inventor. His\n> ability to enchant audiences, to spark a sense of wonder and\n> possibility in their minds, exceeded his scientific skills.\n>\n> To maintain his mythology, Holtzman constantly hungered for new\n> *ideas*--- which required inspiration and long periods of\n> uninterrupted thought. He liked to let possibilities roll like pebbles\n> down a steep mountain slope. Sometimes the pebbles would come to rest,\n> making a bit of noise but\n>\n> ultimately yielding nothing; on other occasions, such notions might\n> spark an avalanche.\n>\n> *Anything imagined can be made real*.\n>\n> But first it must be imagined, seen in the vision of the creator.\n>\n> After returning home from the devastation on Salusa Secundus, he had\n> booked himself a private cabin aboard a luxurious driftbarge, one of\n> the quiet zeppelin craft that rose from the delta city of Starda and\n> drifted inland on currents of warm air, cruising across the seemingly\n> endless Poritrin plains.\n>\n> Holtzman stood on the driftbarge's open deck, looking at the\n> grasslands that flowed in a sea of green and brown, dappled with\n> lakes. Below him, birds flew like schools of fish. The slow aircraft\n> floated with no hurry, no schedule.\n>\n> He stared toward the open horizon. Limitless distances, endless\n> possibilities. Hypnotic, meditative . . . inspirational. Such places\n> opened his mind, allowed him to pursue crazy concepts and run them\n> down like a predator pursuing prey.\n>\n> The driftbarge passed over geometric shapes like tattoos on the\n> ground, carefully sectioned acreage for the labor-intensive farming of\n> sweet cane. Other fields grew plump grains and fibrous threads to make\n> Poritrin cloth. Armies of human slaves worked the farms and ranches\n> like insects from a hive.\n>\n> Following a bucolic derivative of Navachristianity, the people of\n> Poritrin had outlawed computerized harvesting apparatus and restored\n> their society to humbler roots. Without sophisticated machinery, they\n> required a great deal of manual labor. Long ago, Sajak Bludd had been\n> the first League nobleman to introduce actual slavery as a means of\n> making large-scale agriculture viable.\n>\n> That Poritrin lord had justified his act by choosing only those who\n> owed a debt to humanity, mostly Buddislamic cowards who had fled\n> instead of fighting against the repressive Titans and thinking\n> machines. If they hadn't been afraid to help defend humanity, Sajak\n> Bludd said, their added numbers might have been enough to turn the\n> tide of war. Working the fields was a small enough price for their\n> descendants to pay. . . .\n>\n> Holtzman paced the driftbarge's deck, acquired a fluted glass of\n> sugary juice from a server, and sipped it as he pondered. Looking down\n> at the sea of grasses, he relished his mental sojourn. No distractions\n> . . . but as yet no inspiration, either. The great scientist often\n> embarked on such journeys to pull his thoughts together, simply\n> staring and thinking--- and *working*, though everyone else aboard\n> seemed to be taking a holiday.\n>\n> Because of Holtzman's previous successes, Niko Bludd gave him free\n> reign to develop whatever innovative defenses and weapons struck his\n> fancy. Unfortunately, during the past year the scientist had faced a\n> growing conviction that he was running out of ideas.\n>\n> Genius was nothing without creative impulse. Of course, the Savant\n> could coast for a while on his earlier triumphs. Still, he had to\n> offer up new inventions regularly, or even Lord Bludd would begin to\n> doubt him.\n>\n> Holtzman could never permit that. It was a matter of pride.\n>\n> He'd been embarrassed that the cymeks so easily penetrated his\n> scrambler shields on Salusa Secundus. How could he--- and all the\n> other engineers and technicians on the project--- have ignored the\n> fact that cymeks had human minds, not AI gelcircuitry? It was a\n> significant, devastating lapse.\n\nStill, the outpouring of faith and hope--- not to mention substantial\nfunding\n\n> --- made him feel a crippling pressure. The people would never allow\n> him to retire now. He must find some other solution, save the day once\n> more.\n>\n> While back in the blufftop laboratories at his Starda residence, he\n> searched constantly, reading dissertations and theoretical papers\n> transmitted to him, combing them for exploitable possibilities. Many\n> of the reports were\n>\n> esoteric, beyond even his comprehension, but occasionally an idea\n> struck his fancy.\n>\n> Holtzman had brought along numerous recordings for this mental sojourn\n> over the Poritrin plains. One ambitious and intriguing paper had been\n> written by an unknown theorist from Rossak named Norma Cenva. She had\n> no credentials, as far as he could determine, but her concepts were\n> nothing short of amazing. She thought of simple things in a completely\n> different light. He had a gut feeling about her, an instinct. And she\n> had such a low profile. . . .\n>\n> As starlight fell over the vast bowl of Poritrin sky, he sat alone in\n> his cabin drinking a warm fruity beverage. He stared at Norma's\n> calculations, working them repeatedly in his mind, watchful for errors\n> while trying to understand. This young, unknown mathematician seemed\n> to harbor no pretensions, as if she simply pulled new ideas out of the\n> clouds and wanted to share them with a man she considered her\n> intellectual comrade. Stymied by some of her derivations, he realized\n> that his doubts were more about his own lack of ability than about her\n> postulations. Norma Cenva seemed divinely inspired.\n>\n> Exactly what he needed.\n>\n> Restless, Holtzman thought long and hard into the night. Finally, with\n> the arrival of dawn, he relaxed and drifted off to sleep, his decision\n> made. The airborne barge rocked in gentle breezes and continued to\n> float across the flat landscape. He dozed off with a smile on his\n> face.\n>\n> Soon he would meet Norma for himself. Perhaps some of her concepts\n> might be applicable to devices he wanted to employ against the\n> thinking machines.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THAT AFTERNOON THE Savant wrote a personal invitation to Norma Cenva\n> and dispatched it to Rossak by League courier. This young woman\n>\n> who had grown up isolated in the jungles just might prove to be his\n> salvation . . . if he handled the situation properly.\n>\n> *Opportunities are a tricky crop, with tiny flowers that are difficult\n> to see and even more difficult to harvest.*\n>\n> --- ANONYMOUS\n>\n> **F**eeling like an intruder, Norma Cenva stood in her mother's study,\n> overlooking the canopied purple trees. A sour, misty rain fell\n> outside; some of the droplets from the high skies contained impurities\n> and poisonous chemicals from spewing volcanic fumes in the distance.\n> On the far horizon, she monitored dark clouds as they drew closer.\n> Soon there would be a downpour.\n>\n> What did Aurelius Venport want her to find in here?\n>\n> Her stern mother maintained an austere room with chalky-white interior\n> walls. An alcove contained the Sorceress's fine clothes, articles that\n> were much too large and fanciful for Norma to wear. Zufa Cenva had an\n> intimidating beauty, a luminous purity that made her as perfect--- and\n> as hard--- as a classic sculpture. Even without telepathic powers, she\n> could draw men like ants to honey.\n>\n> But the chief Sorceress had only a superficial loveliness, concealing\n> an implacability about subjects she never permitted Norma to see. It\n> wasn't that Zufa didn't trust her daughter; she simply considered the\n> girl beneath grand concerns. Like her telepathic companions, Zufa\n> seemed to thrive on secrecy.\n>\n> But Aurelius had seen something here. \"You won't be sorry if you find\n> it, Norma,\" he had told her, smiling. \"I trust your mother to tell you\n> about it eventually . . . but I don't believe it is high in her\n> priorities.\"\n>\n> *I have never been high in her priorities.* Curious, but wary of being\n> caught, Norma continued to investigate.\n>\n> Her gaze settled on a fibersheet notebook resting on a worktable. The\n> thick book had a maroon cover with indecipherable lettering as arcane\n> as the\n>\n> mathematical notations Norma had developed. Once, eavesdropping on the\n> Sorceresses and their intricate plans, Norma heard them refer to their\n> private language as \"Azhar.\"\n>\n> Since returning from Salusa Secundus, her mother had been even more\n> detached and aloof than usual. She seemed driven to attempt greater\n> things, because of the cymek attack. When Norma inquired about the war\n> effort, Zufa had merely frowned at her. \"We will take care of it.\"\n>\n> The chief Sorceress spent much of her time sequestered with a\n> cabalistic clique of women, whispering secret things. Zufa had a fresh\n> passion, a new idea to use against the thinking machines. If her\n> mother had dreamed of any way Norma could contribute, she would have\n> pressed the dwarf girl into service. Instead, Zufa had entirely\n> written off her daughter without giving her a chance.\n>\n> The most talented women, numbering around three hundred, had\n> established a security zone in the deep fungoid jungle, cutting off\n> the pharmaceutical scavengers hired by Aurelius Venport. Any explorer\n> who ventured into the secluded area encountered strange shimmering\n> barricades.\n>\n> Ever alert, Norma had noticed unexplained explosions and fires out\n> where Zufa's hand-picked Sorceresses spent weeks of intensive\n> training. Her mother rarely came back to her cliffside chambers. . . .\n>\n> Now, in her mother's room, Norma discovered two pieces of fine white\n> paper beneath the maroon notebook: the bleached parchment often used\n> by League couriers. This must be what Aurelius had wanted her to find.\n>\n> Dragging a stepstool to the table, she climbed up. She could see the\n> heading on the top sheet of parchment--- a formal document from\n> Poritrin. Curious, afraid her mother might return from the jungles,\n> she removed the pages and was astonished to read in black chancery\n> lettering, SAVANT TIO HOLTZMAN.\n>\n> For what possible purpose had the great inventor written a letter to\n> her mother? Leaning down, the girl read the salutation line: \"Dear\n> Norma\n>\n> Cenva.\" With a scowl, she scanned the message, then reread it with\n> mounting delight mixed with anger. *Tio Holtzman wants me to\n> apprentice with him on Poritrin! He thinks I am brilliant? I can't\n> believe it*.\n>\n> Her own mother had attempted to conceal, or at least delay, the\n> transmittal! Zufa had said nothing, possibly unable to believe the\n> Savant would want anything to do with her daughter. Luckily, Aurelius\n> had told her about it.\n>\n> Norma hurried off to the business district of the cliffside\n> settlement. She found Venport in a tea shop, concluding a meeting with\n> a seedy-looking trader. As the dark-skinned man rose from his seat,\n> Norma hurried over with her off-kilter gait and slid into his place at\n> the table.\n>\n> Venport smiled warmly at her. \"You look excited, Norma. You must have\n> found the letter from Savant Holtzman?\"\n>\n> She thrust the parchment forward. \"My mother tried to prevent me from\n> seeing his offer!\"\n>\n> \"Zufa is a maddening woman, I know, but you must try to understand\n> her. Since neither of us can do the things she values most, Zufa\n> disregards our abilities. Oh, she's aware of your mathematical\n> talents, Norma, and she knows I'm a competent businessman, but our\n> skills do not count for anything with her.\"\n>\n> Norma squirmed on the seat, not wanting to give her mother the benefit\n> of the doubt. \"Then why did she hide this letter?\"\n>\n> Venport laughed. \"She was probably embarrassed by the attention you\n> received.\" He squeezed her hand. \"Don't worry, I will intervene if\n> your mother attempts to block this. In fact, since she's so\n> preoccupied with the other Sorceresses, I can't see how she would\n> object if I were to complete the necessary paperwork for you.\"\n>\n> \"You would do that? Doesn't my mother---\"\n>\n> \"Let me take care of everything. I'll handle her.\" He gave Norma a\n> quick, warm hug. \"I believe in what you can do.\"\n>\n> Acting in Zufa's stead, Aurelius Venport dispatched a formal letter of\n> response to the famous inventor, agreeing to send Norma away. The\n> young woman would study with him on Poritrin and assist him in his\n> laboratories. For Norma, it was the opportunity of a lifetime.\n>\n> Her mother might not even notice she was gone.\n>\n> *Home can be anywhere, for it is a part of one's self.*\n>\n> --- Zensunni saying\n>\n> **E**ven in the wasteland, with wind whipping around him, Selim's luck\n> continued to hold. Survival itself became a wondrous game out in the\n> desert.\n>\n> Leaving the dead sandworm behind, he'd tried to find a small cave or\n> gully in the rocks where he could crouch from the approaching storm.\n> Desperately thirsty, Selim poked around for any signs of human\n> habitation, though he doubted any other man had ever set foot so far\n> out in the arid wilderness.\n>\n> Certainly no one who had lived.\n>\n> After wandering from planet to planet, the Zensunni had come to\n> Arrakis, where they scattered in widely separated settlements. For\n> several generations, the scavenger people had scraped a meager\n> existence from the desert, but only occasionally did they venture from\n> their protected areas, fearful of giant worms.\n>\n> The wild sandworm had taken Selim far from the spaceport, far from the\n> vital supplies that even the most resourceful Zensunni would require.\n> His prospects for survival seemed bleak indeed.\n>\n> So when he stumbled upon an ancient botanical testing station\n> camouflaged in the rocks, Selim could hardly believe his good fortune.\n> Undoubtedly, it was another sign from Buddallah. A miracle!\n>\n> He stood before the domed enclosure erected by long-forgotten\n> ecologists who had studied Arrakis and found it wanting. Perhaps a few\n> Old Empire scientists had lived here and recorded data during a storm\n> season. The rugged structure consisted of several low outbuildings\n> built into the rocks, half-disguised by time and windblown sand.\n>\n> As the howling tempest peppered him with stinging sand, Selim\n> scrambled around the abandoned station. He saw tilted weather vanes,\n> dented wind collectors and other data-gathering devices that looked\n> long dead. Most important, he found an entry hatch.\n>\n> With sore hands and aching arms from his worm-riding ordeal, Selim\n> pounded against the barrier, searching for a way inside. He scooped\n> powdery debris away, looking for some sort of manual mechanism, since\n> batteries would have long since died. He needed to get into the\n> shelter before the storm wind slammed into him with full intensity.\n>\n> Selim had heard of such places. A few had been found and raided by\n> Zensunni scavengers. These self-reliant stations had been placed on\n> Arrakis during humanity's glory days, before the thinking machines had\n> taken over, before Buddislamic refugees had fled to safety. This\n> automated facility was at least a thousand years old, probably more.\n> But in the desert, where the environment remained unchanged for\n> millennia, time ran at a different pace.\n>\n> Selim finally located the mechanism that controlled the hatch. As he\n> had feared, the power cells were dead, providing only enough of a\n> spark to make the door groan open the barest crack.\n>\n> The wind howled. Blown sand hung like fog on the horizon, obscuring\n> the sun. Dust tingled against his raw ears and face, and Selim knew it\n> would soon become a deadly scouring.\n>\n> Growing more desperate, he wedged his sandworm tooth into the dark\n> opening and used it as a pry bar. The aperture widened a little, but\n> not enough. Cold, stale air gasped out. He used the aching muscles in\n> his arms, dug his feet against the rocks to throw his body weight into\n> the effort, and pushed hard on the makeshift lever.\n>\n> With a last groan of resistance, the hatch grated partway open. Selim\n> laughed and tossed the curved worm fang into the interior, where it\n> made a tinkling clatter on the metal floor. He squirmed through into\n> the station, heard the muffled roar of the sandstorm increasing\n> outside. It was on top of him.\n>\n> Impeded by wind and blown sand, Selim grasped the lip of the hatch and\n> pushed hard. Incoming sand fell through a grating in the floor, into a\n> receptacle below. He needed to hurry. The wind let up for only a\n> second, but that was enough. He got the door shut, sealing himself in,\n> away from the violent weather.\n>\n> Safe . . . unbelievably safe. He laughed at his good fortune, then\n> gave a prayer of thanks, more sincere than any he had uttered in his\n> life. How could he question such blessings?\n>\n> Selim used the shaft of wan daylight to look around. Luckily, the\n> abandoned station had plaz windows. Though scratched and pitted from\n> prolonged exposure, they allowed fading illumination inside.\n>\n> The place was like a cave of treasure. Guided by the dust-filtered\n> light from the windows, he found a few old glowstrips which he coaxed\n> into brightening the small shelter. Then he ransacked cupboards and\n> storage vaults. Much of what remained was useless: unreadable\n> data-plaques, dead computerized recording systems, strange instruments\n> that bore the names of archaic corporations. He did, however, find\n> capsules of well-preserved food that had not deteriorated even in all\n> the time this facility had been abandoned.\n>\n> He broke open a capsule and ate the contents. Though the flavors were\n> unusual, the food tasted wonderful, and he felt energy seeping back\n> into his weary flesh. Other containers held concentrated juices, which\n> were like ambrosia to him. Most valuable of all, he found distilled\n> water, hundreds of literjons of it. Undoubtedly it had been collected\n> over the centuries by automated moisture extractors left behind by the\n> long-ago scientific expedition.\n>\n> This was personal wealth beyond anything Selim had imagined possible.\n> He could pay back the brackish water he'd been accused of taking from\n> the tribe a thousand times over. He could return to the Zensunni as a\n> hero. Naib Dhartha would have to forgive him. But Selim had never\n> committed the crime in the first place.\n>\n> While Selim sat comfortable and satisfied, he vowed never to give\n> Dhartha the satisfaction of seeing him return. Ebrahim had betrayed\n> his friendship, and the corrupt Naib had falsely condemned him. His\n> own people had exiled him, never expecting him to survive. Now that he\n> had found a way to live by himself, why would Selim ever want to go\n> back and surrender it all?\n>\n> For two straight nights, the young man slept. At dawn on the second\n> day he awoke and opened more of the sealed boxes and cabinets. He\n> discovered tools, rope, durable fabric, construction material. The\n> possibilities filled him with joy, and Selim found himself chuckling\n> all alone inside the botanical testing station.\n>\n> *I'm alive!*\n>\n> The storm had rattled past as he slept, unsuccessfully scratching\n> against the walls of the shelter like a monster trying to get in. Most\n> of the sand had been deflected, so very little was piled around the\n> enclosure. From the vantage of the station's largest window, Selim\n> gazed across the desert sea that he had crossed on the back of the\n> sandworm. The dunes were fresh and spotless. All signs of the dead\n> worm had been erased, scoured clean. Only this solitary young man\n> remained.\n>\n> He envisioned a long journey ahead of him, and thought he must have a\n> particular calling. Why else would Buddallah have gone to so much\n> trouble to allow poor Selim to live?\n>\n> *What do you want me to do?*\n>\n> Smiling, the outcast looked out upon the desert, wondering how he\n> could possibly cross such an expanse again. The vista filled him with\n> a sensation of supreme solitude. He made out a few rocks in the\n> distance, etched by eternal winds. Here and there were a few hardy\n> plants. Small animals scurried into burrows. Dune merged into dune,\n> desert into desert.\n>\n> Enthralled by his own memories and feeling recklessly invulnerable,\n> Selim decided what he must do, sooner or later. The first time had\n> been an incredible fluke, but he understood better how to do it now.\n>\n> He must ride a sandworm again. And the next time it would not be an\n> accident.\n>\n> *One of the questions the Butlerian Jihad answered with violence was\n> whether the human body is simply a machine that a* man-made *machine\n> can duplicate.

RAJID SUK,\n\n*Post-Trauma Analysis of the Human Species*\n\n> **W**earing a new warrior-form designed to strike terror into the\n> humans on Giedi Prime, Agamemnon strode on armored legs through the\n> broken industries and flaming ruins of the city. The *hrethgir* hadn't\n> stood a chance.\n>\n> Giedi Prime had been conquered easily.\n>\n> The invading machine troops plodded forward, targeting habitation\n> complexes and setting them aflame, blasting parks into blackened\n> fields. In accordance with Agamemnon's orders--- citing the glory of\n> Omnius--- the neo-cymeks and robotic warriors left the Giedi City\n> industries essentially intact.\n>\n> Agamemnon had sworn that Giedi Prime would make up for the cymeks'\n> humiliation on Salusa. Even now, watcheyes flew overhead, recording\n> the carnage, seeing how efficiently the two Titans guided the military\n> operation.\n>\n> Accompanied by his comrade Barbarossa, Agamemnon scanned the\n> topography of the metropolis and located the Magnus's magnificent\n> residence. It was an appropriate place to establish the new center of\n> Synchronized government, a symbolic gesture of domination as well as\n> an affront to the defeated populace.\n>\n> The cymek general's warrior-form was the most monstrous multilegged\n> system he had ever conceived. Electrical discharges fired through\n> artificial muscles, pulling fiber cables taut and moving\n> weapon-studded limbs. He flexed his flowmetal claws and crushed\n> construction blocks in his grip,\n>\n> imagining them to be the skulls of enemies. Following in his own\n> ferocious configuration, Barbarossa laughed at the showmanship.\n>\n> Marching forward on many limbs, the cymeks thundered through the\n> wreckage-strewn streets. Nothing stood in the way of these former\n> warlords. The situation reminded both of them of a thousand years\n> before, when twenty Titans had conquered the Old Empire by trampling\n> the bodies of their foes.\n>\n> This was the way it should be. It only whetted their appetite for\n> more.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> PRIOR TO THE attack, Agamemnon had studied Giedi Prime's defenses,\n> analyzing images taken by spy watcheyes that zoomed through the system\n> like tiny meteoroids. From those readings, the cymek general had\n> concocted a brilliant tactical move, exploiting a slight weakness in\n> planetary defenses. Omnius had been willing to pay the necessary price\n> to take over a League World, and it had not cost the life of a single\n> Titan, not even one of the lesser neo-cymeks. Only a single robotic\n> cruiser. Perfectly acceptable, as far as Agamemnon was concerned.\n>\n> The humans had erected scrambler fields here like those on Salusa,\n> centering their transmitting towers in Giedi City. The field-generator\n> facility had been guarded by kindjal fighter craft, supposedly\n> impregnable embankments, and massively armored ground vehicles. The\n> feral humans had learned a lesson on Salusa Secundus. But it was not\n> enough to protect them from obliteration.\n>\n> Giedi Prime's first-line orbital protective forces had been brushed\n> aside by the unstoppable force of the giant machine fleet. All robot\n> losses were acceptable. When Agamemnon led the cymek ships in, along\n> with the sacrificial cruisers, the planetbound human defenders could\n> not hope to drive them back.\n>\n> To begin the assault, the huge robotic cruiser had positioned itself\n> above Giedi Prime, its cargo holds filled with explosives. Dozens of\n> other robot\n>\n> cruisers moved with machine grace, sleek and streamlined, lining up\n> for the assault. Guided by a thinking machine intelligence, the\n> enormous craft fired its engines and accelerated at full speed toward\n> its target.\n>\n> \"Descent approach in progress,\" the battleship's robot mind had\n> reported, transmitting images to the waiting fighters. Ahead, thirty\n> decoy vessels shot downward, also hoping to strike the target but\n> designed to be targets for the ground-based missile defenses. The plan\n> relied on brute force and overwhelming numbers, not finesse.\n> Nevertheless, it would be effective.\n>\n> With its engines at full speed, the sacrificial vessel had accelerated\n> white-hot into Giedi Prime's atmosphere, faster than any ground-based\n> human missile defenses could target and respond. The other cruisers\n> approached the invisible scrambler shield. Already, gray-white\n> blossoms of smoke and explosions marked where the ground-launched\n> missiles had found targets. The numbers dwindled, as did the distance.\n> The humans could never stop all the invaders.\n>\n> The doomed robot ship sent final images back to the watcheyes so\n> Omnius would have a complete record of the conquest of Giedi Prime.\n> Every nanosecond--- until it passed through the scrambler net, which\n> effectively erased the AI guidance brain. The transmissions became\n> static, then an empty carrier wave.\n>\n> Still, the juggernaut had continued to descend. Even with its\n> gelcircuitry brain neutralized, the plummeting cruiser fell like an\n> asteroidsized hammer.\n>\n> Kindjal fighter craft directly engaged the last explosive-laden\n> vessel, but the inbound ship was too big and too hot to be swerved.\n> The defenders' shots amounted to little more than pellets.\n>\n> The giant dead vessel slammed into the field transmitters on the\n> outskirts of Giedi City. A crater half a kilometer wide flashed into\n> steam; the transmitters, the overwhelmed defenses, and the surrounding\n> inhabited areas all vanished.\n>\n> Shockwaves had toppled buildings for kilometers around and shattered\n> windows. Holtzman's scrambler shields were neutralized in the blink of\n> an eye, and the Giedi Home Guard was crippled.\n>\n> After that, the cymeks and robots had come down in full force.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> \"BARBAROSSA, MY FRIEND, shall we make our grand entrance?\" Agamemnon\n> said, arriving at the residence of the Magnus.\n>\n> \"Just like when we followed Tlaloc into the halls of the Old Empire,\"\n> his fellow Titan agreed. \"It has been a long time since I've enjoyed a\n> victory so much.\"\n>\n> They led enthusiastic neo-cymeks easily through the reeling\n> metropolis. The stunned human inhabitants could not even put up a\n> fight. Behind the cymek conquerors marched robotic troops to help\n> secure the territory.\n>\n> Although part of Giedi Prime's population might flee underground and\n> hide, the citizenry would break, given time. It might take years to\n> root out the last cells of feral resistance.

Within moments, the robots brought blond-haired\n> Magnus Sumi before the two Titans.\n>\n> \"We claim your planet in the name of Omnius,\" Barbarossa declared.\n> \"Giedi Prime is now a Synchronized World. We require your cooperation\n> to consolidate our victory.\"\n>\n> Magnus Sumi, trembling with fear, nevertheless spat on the broken\n> floor where the weight of the cymek warrior-forms had crushed his\n> carefully laid tiles.\n>\n> \"Bow to us,\" Barbarossa said.\n>\n> The Magnus laughed. \"You're mad. I would never---\"\n>\n> Agamemnon swung one of his sleek metal arms sideways. He had not fully\n> tested this new body and was not aware of the magnitude of his\n> strength. He had meant to strike the governor in the face, an\n> instinctive angry slap. Instead, the arm delivered a blow so forceful\n> that it ripped the man's torso in half.

Manion Butler served up exquisite roasts\n> of beef, spice-crusted fowl, and stuffed fishes. Serena provided\n> colorful flowers from her extensive gardens, which she had faithfully\n> tended since she was a child.\n>\n> Famous Salusan performers tied ribbons on shrubs in the courtyard, and\n> presented folk dances there. The women secured their dark hair with\n> jeweled combs and wore white dresses adorned with embroidered\n> patterns. The flowing skirts flew like whirlwinds about their waists,\n> while dapper gentlemen strutted around them like peacocks in a mating\n> challenge. Brassy music offset by soulful balisets drifted through the\n> afternoon.\n>\n> Xavier and Serena wore impressive outfits befitting a proud military\n> officer and the talented daughter of the League Viceroy. They strolled\n> among the assembled guests, careful to address each family\n> representative by name. The couple sampled prized wines from dusty\n> bottles brought in by the scions of every household. Xavier, who could\n> taste none of the subtleties in the vintages, took care not to get too\n> drunk; he was already giddy at the prospect of his upcoming marriage.\n>\n> Serena's sister Octa, two years younger, seemed equally excited. With\n> her long chestnut hair adorned by fresh cornflowers, Octa's eyes were\n> wide\n>\n> with amazement, enchanted by her sister's beau and fantasizing about a\n> handsome young officer who might be her own husband one day.\n>\n> Amazingly, Serena's reclusive mother Livia came to spend the\n> celebratory weekend at the Butler manor. Manion's wife rarely left the\n> City of Introspection, a retreat where she kept herself from the cares\n> and nightmares of the world. The enlightened philosophical preserve,\n> owned by a Butler trust, had originally been established to study and\n> ponder the Zen Hekiganshu of III Delta Pavonis, the Tawrah and\n> Talmudic Zabur, even the Obeah Ritual. But under Butler patronage, the\n> City had gradually blossomed into something the likes of which had not\n> been seen for millennia.\n>\n> Xavier had not seen Serena's mother often, especially in recent years.\n> With her tanned skin and lean features, Livia Butler was a handsome\n> beauty. She rejoiced in the betrothal of her daughter and seemed to\n> enjoy herself as she danced with her jovial husband or sat beside him\n> at the banquet table. She looked not at all like a woman who had fled\n> from the world.\n>\n> Years ago, Livia and Manion's strong marriage had been envied by many\n> noble families. Serena was their eldest child, but they also had twins\n> two years younger: the calm and shy Octa and a sensitive, intelligent\n> boy, Fredo. While Serena underwent political schooling, the twins were\n> raised as close companions, though neither had the far-ranging\n> aspirations of their older sister.\n>\n> Fredo had been fascinated by musical instruments and folk songs,\n> traditions from the grandest planets of the former Empire. He learned\n> to be a musician and poet, while Octa was intrigued with painting and\n> sculpture. In Salusan society, artisans and creative people were\n> highly respected, as admirable as any politician.\n>\n> But at the age of fourteen, honey-voiced Fredo died of a wasting\n> disease, his skin splotched with purplish discolorations. For months,\n> he'd grown thinner and thinner, his muscles atrophying. His blood\n> would not clot, and he could not keep even the thinnest of broths in\n> his stomach. The Salusan\n>\n> doctors had never seen anything like it. Frantic, Viceroy Butler\n> begged the League for help.\n>\n> The men of Rossak offered a number of experimental drugs from their\n> fungoid jungles to treat Fredo's undiagnosed malady. Livia insisted on\n> trying everything. Unfortunately, the young man reacted poorly to the\n> third Rossak drug, an allergic response that caused his throat to\n> swell. Fredo went into convulsions and stopped breathing.\n>\n> Octa had mourned the loss of her brother and came to fear for her own\n> life as well. Fredo's disease was eventually determined to be\n> genetically based, meaning that she and her older sister were at risk\n> of contracting the fatal malady themselves. Octa took care with her\n> health and lived each day dreading that her life would come to a slow,\n> painful end like that of her brother.\n>\n> Fiercely confident and optimistic, Serena always tried to console her\n> sister, giving her a shoulder to cry on, offering encouragement.\n> Though neither sister had shown signs of the strange disease, Octa's\n> dreams had lost all momentum, and she gave up her artwork, becoming a\n> quieter, more pensive soul. She was a frail teenager now, hoping for a\n> spark of wonder to bring her back to the fullness of life.\n>\n> Though her husband had a brilliant political career and his importance\n> grew with each season, formerly vivacious Livia had withdrawn from\n> public life to her spiritual retreat, where she focused on\n> philosophical and religious pursuits. She donated large sums to the\n> imposing fortress to build additional meditation chambers, temples,\n> and libraries. After devoting many sleepless nights to frank\n> discussions with the Cogitor Kwyna, Livia became the Abbess of the\n> facility.\n>\n> In the aftermath of the tragedy, Manion Butler had immersed himself in\n> League work, while Serena felt a heavier burden and set higher goals.\n> Though she could do nothing to help her brother, she wanted to stop\n> the suffering of other people whenever she could. She plunged into\n> politics, working to stop the practice of human slavery still common\n> on some\n>\n> League Worlds, and pledging herself to finding a way to overthrow the\n> thinking machines. No one had ever accused her of lacking in vision or\n> energy. . . .\n>\n> Living separate lives now, Manion and Livia Butler remained pillars of\n> Salusan society, proud of each other's accomplishments--- not\n> divorced, not even emotionally separated . . . just following\n> different paths. Xavier knew that Serena's mother occasionally came\n> back to spend nights with her husband and enjoy weekends with her\n> daughters. But she always returned to the City of Introspection.\n>\n> Serena's betrothal had been important enough to bring her mother into\n> the public eye again. After Xavier danced with his future bride four\n> times in a row, Abbess Livia insisted on having a dance with her\n> future son-in-law.\n>\n> Later, during a long acoustic set of the Long March Ballads played by\n> native Salusan minstrels, Xavier and Serena slipped into the manor\n> house, leaving Livia to weep unabashedly as she watched the musicians\n> and remembered how Fredo had wanted to become a player himself. Manion\n> sat beside his wife, rocking her gently.\n>\n> At the event in their honor, Xavier and Serena had by now experienced\n> their fill of company and revelry, of greeting guests and sampling\n> food and wine. They laughed at every witticism, whether subtle or\n> crude, so as not to offend the grand families. By now, the two were\n> desperate for just a few moments alone.\n>\n> Finally they slipped away and hurried through the corridors of the\n> manor house, past hot kitchens and musty storerooms, to a small alcove\n> outside the Winter Sun room. In winter, slanted sunshine lit this room\n> with bronze rainbows. The Butler family traditionally took their\n> breakfasts here during the cold season, enjoying family conversation\n> while they watched the rising sun. It was a place of fond memories for\n> Serena.\n>\n> She crowded with Xavier into the alcove just outside the room;\n> glow-panels shone in the hall, but still allowed a few rich shadows.\n> Serena pulled him close and kissed him. He placed a hand behind her\n> neck and stroked her\n>\n> hair as he pulled her face close to his and kissed more deeply, hungry\n> for her.\n>\n> When they heard hurried footsteps in the hall, the lovers hid in\n> silence, quietly chuckling at their secret rendezvous. But fresh-faced\n> Octa easily found them. Flushed with embarrassment, Octa averted her\n> gaze. \"You must come back to the banquet hall. Father is ready to\n> serve dessert. And an offworld messenger is coming.\"\n>\n> \"A messenger?\" Xavier suddenly sounded military and formal. \"From\n> whom?\"\n>\n> \"He went to Zimia demanding an audience with the League Parliament,\n> but since most of the nobles are here for the banquet, he's on his way\n> up the hill.\"\n>\n> Bending his elbows outward, Xavier offered an arm to each sister. \"Let\n> us go together so we can hear what this messenger has to say.\" Forcing\n> a lighthearted tone, he said, \"After all, I haven't eaten enough\n> today. I could use a bowl of roast custard and a whole plateful of\n> candied eggs.\"\n>\n> Octa giggled, but Serena gave him a mock stern frown. \"I suppose I\n> must resign myself to life with a fat husband.\"\n>\n> They entered the large hall, where the guests gathered around a long\n> table, complimenting the array of extraordinarily beautiful desserts\n> that looked too precious to be eaten. Manion and Livia Butler stood\n> side by side, raising a toast to the couple.\n>\n> Sipping politely from his wine, Xavier detected an undercurrent of\n> worry in the Viceroy's manner. Everyone pretended to be unconcerned\n> about what news the messenger might bring, but the moment a pounding\n> sounded on the door, all activity stopped. Manion Butler himself\n> opened the wooden portal, gesturing for the man to enter.\n>\n> He wasn't a formal courier. His eyes were haunted and his officer's\n> uniform unkempt, as if he no longer cared about protocol or\n> appearances. Xavier\n>\n> recognized the insignia of the Giedi Prime Home Guard. Like other\n> League uniforms, it bore the gold sigil of free humanity on the lapel.\n>\n> \"I have grave news, Viceroy Butler. The fastest ships have brought me\n> directly here.\"\n>\n> \"What is it, young man?\" Manion's voice was filled with dread.\n>\n> \"Giedi Prime has fallen to the thinking machines!\" The officer raised\n> his voice against the guests' disbelieving outcries. \"The robots and\n> cymeks found a flaw in our defenses and destroyed our scrambler-field\n> transmitters. Much of our population has been slaughtered and the\n> survivors enslaved. A new Omnius evermind has already been activated.\"\n>\n> The people in the hall wailed at hearing of the devastating defeat.\n> Xavier clutched Serena's hand so tightly he feared he might hurt her.\n> Inside, he had turned to stone, his stomach filled with a cold\n> heaviness.\n>\n> He had just been to Giedi Prime, had inspected the defenses himself.\n> Xavier had been terribly anxious to finish his inspection tour so that\n> he could return to Serena. Could he possibly have missed something? He\n> squeezed his eyes shut as the questions and disbelieving comments\n> turned to a buzz around him. Was he to blame? Had a simple mistake, a\n> bit of impatience from a young man in love, caused an entire planet to\n> fall?\n>\n> Manion Butler placed both palms on the table to steady himself. Livia\n> reached over to touch her husband's shoulder, adding silent support.\n> She closed her eyes, and her lips moved as if in prayer.\n>\n> The Viceroy spoke. \"Another free planet lost to the Synchronized\n> Worlds, and one of our strongholds, too.\" He straightened, took a\n> shuddering breath. \"We must call an immediate war council, summon all\n> representatives.\" With a meaningful glance at Serena, he added, \"Let\n> us also include anyone who speaks for the Unallied Planets and wishes\n> to join us in this fight.\"\n>\n> *Everything in the universe contains flaws, ourselves included.

Inside her private chamber, Zufa Cenva lay\n> sweat-streaked on a pallet. She shrieked in pain, clenching her teeth,\n> her eyes glassy.\n>\n> Alone. No one dared come near a delirious Sorceress of Rossak.\n>\n> A metallic doorway curtain rattled with an invisible tele-kinetic\n> force. Wall shelves buckled in the aftershocks of Zufa's psychic\n> explosions, scattering pots and keepsakes all over the floor.\n>\n> Her long white hair was wild, quivering with internal energy. Her pale\n> hands gripped the sides of the pallet like scraping claws. If any\n> woman had come close enough to try to soothe her, Zufa would have\n> scratched her face and mentally hurled her against the whitewashed\n> walls.\n>\n> She screamed again. The chief Sorceress had endured several\n> miscarriages before, but never one so agonizing or disruptive. She\n> cursed worthless Aurelius Venport.\n>\n> Zufa's spine shuddered, as if someone had jolted her with electricity.\n> Delicate ornamental objects floated into the air on invisible strings,\n> then flew in every direction, smashing into shards. One hollowed-out\n> irongourd stuffed with dried flowers burst into white flames,\n> crackling and smoking.\n>\n> She gasped as her body cramped, squeezing her abdominal muscles. It\n> seemed as if this unborn child wanted to kill her, to drag her down to\n> death before she could expel it from her uterus.\n>\n> Another failure! And she so desperately wanted to produce a true\n> daughter, a successor to lead her fellow Sorceresses to new heights of\n> mental power. The genetic index had misled her again. Damn Venport and\n> his failings! She should have abandoned him long ago.\n>\n> Out of her head with pain and despair, Zufa wanted to kill the man who\n> had planted the child-seed inside her, even though the pregnancy had\n> been at her own insistence. She had completed the bloodline\n> calculations so carefully, had gone over the genes again and again.\n> Breeding with Venport should have produced only superior offspring.\n>\n> Nothing like this.\n>\n> Telepathic blasts echoed into the corridors, sending Rossak women\n> scurrying in terror. Then she saw Aurelius Venport himself standing at\n> the doorway, haggard with worry. His eyes were filled with concern.\n>\n> But Zufa knew he was a liar.\n>\n> Unafraid for his own safety, Venport entered their bedchamber,\n> displaying patience, concern, and tolerance. His lover's mental blasts\n> ricocheted around the large room, overturning furniture. In a petulant\n> attempt to slight him, she smashed a set of tiny hollownut sculptures\n> he had given her during their courtship and genetic testing.\n>\n> Still, he stepped forward, as if immune to her ferine outbursts. In\n> the hall behind him, muted voices urged caution, but he ignored them.\n> He came to her pallet, smiling with compassion and understanding.\n>\n> Venport knelt beside the bed, stroking her sweaty hand. He whispered\n> soothing nonsense in her ears. She couldn't understand his words, but\n> she grasped his fingers until she expected to feel the bones snap. But\n> he remained frustratingly close, not intimidated by her in the least.\n>\n> Zufa hurled accusations of treachery at him. \"I can sense your\n> thoughts! I know you're thinking only of yourself.\"\n>\n> Her imagination concocted schemes, attributing them to his\n> deviousness. If the great Zufa Cenva was no longer there to protect\n> him, who would keep this man as a pet? Who would care for him? She\n> doubted he could take care of himself.\n>\n> Then, with greater fear:*Or could he?*\n>\n> Venport had sent Norma off on a long journey to Poritrin, arranging\n> everything behind Zufa's back, as if he believed that a man like Tio\n> Holtzman truly wanted to work with her daughter. What was he planning?\n> She gritted her teeth, wanting to prove that she understood his\n> intentions. Her threats came as sharp gasps. \"You can't . . . let me\n> die, bastard! No one . . . else would . . . have you!\"\n>\n> Instead, he looked at her, coolly patronizing. \"You've told me many\n> times that I come from a good genetic line, my darling. But I do not\n> desire someone else among the Sorceresses. I prefer to stay with you.\"\n> He lowered his voice, looking at her with an oddly intense love that\n> she could not quite fathom. \"I understand you better than you do\n> yourself, Zufa Cenva. Always pushing, constantly demanding more than\n> anyone can possibly give. Nobody--- not even you--- can be perfect all\n> the time.\"\n>\n> With a final prolonged shriek, she expelled her deformed, resistant\n> fetus, a monstrously abnormal creature. Seeing the bright blood,\n> Venport bellowed for assistance, and two brave midwives scurried into\n> the chamber. One reached down with a towel, placing it over the fetus\n> like a shroud, while the other bathed Zufa's skin, adding pain-numbing\n> salves distilled from jungle spores. Venport sent for the best drugs\n> from his own stockpiles.\n>\n> Finally, he took the squirming fetus himself, holding the bloody\n> larval thing in his hands. It had dark skin and strange mottled spots\n> that made it look as if proto-eyes had grown all over its limbless\n> body. He saw the thing twitch a final time, then it stopped moving.\n>\n> He wrapped it up in the towel, trying to ignore the tear in his eye.\n> His expression stony, Venport handed the corrupt fetus to one of the\n> midwives,\n>\n> saying nothing. It would be taken out into the jungles, and no one\n> would ever see it again.\n>\n> The exhausted Sorceress lay back, shuddering, just now beginning to\n> feel a sense of reality and despair again. The miscarriage had hurt\n> her, leaving her with a deep sadness that went beyond the goals of any\n> breeding program. Her vision returned to focus, and she noticed the\n> psychokinetic destruction she had caused in the room. It all spoke of\n> weakness, of lack of control.\n>\n> This was her third horrific miscarriage from mating with Venport. Deep\n> disappointment and anger boiled inside her. \"I chose you for your\n> bloodline, Aurelius,\" she muttered through dry lips. \"What went\n> wrong?\"\n>\n> He looked at her, still expressionless, as if his passion had been\n> washed away. \"Genetics is not an exact science.\"\n>\n> Zufa closed her eyes. \"Failures, always failures.\" She was the\n> greatest Sorceress of Rossak, and yet she had endured so many\n> disappointments. Sighing with disgust, Zufa thought of her stunted\n> daughter, not wanting to believe that the ugly dwarf was the best she\n> could achieve.\n>\n> Venport shook his head, uncharacteristically stern and impatient now\n> that the danger was past. \"You have had successes, Zufa. You just\n> don't know how to recognize them.\"\n>\n> She forced herself to rest, to recuperate. Eventually, Zufa would have\n> to try again, but with someone else.\n>\n> *Overly organized research is confining, and guaranteed to produce\n> nothing new.*\n>\n> --- TIO HOLTZMAN,\n\nletter to Lord Niko Bludd\n\n> **A**rriving on Poritrin at the conclusion of her first long space\n> voyage, Norma Cenva felt out of place. Her diminutive form drew\n> glances, but was not so unusual that people turned pitying stares upon\n> her. On the Unallied Planets there was a variety of races, some with\n> stunted statures. She didn't care about the opinions of others anyway.\n> She only wanted to impress Tio Holtzman.\n>\n> Before Norma's departure from Rossak, her aloof mother had looked down\n> at her with dismissive puzzlement. Zufa chose to believe that the\n> brilliant Savant had made a mistake or had misread one of Norma's\n> theoretical papers. She expected her daughter to return home before\n> long.\n>\n> Aurelius Venport had made all of the arrangements, used his own\n> profits to pay for a nicer cabin than Holtzman had offered. While her\n> mother continued to work with the Sorceress trainees, Venport had\n> accompanied Norma to the docking-transfer stations in Rossak orbit. He\n> had given her a gift of delicately petrified flowers and a chaste hug\n> before she'd climbed aboard the vessel. With a wry smile, he told her,\n> \"All of us disappointments need to stick together.\"\n>\n> Norma held onto that warm but troubling comment during the long\n> journey to Poritrin. . . .\n>\n> When the shuttle landed in the river-delta city of Starda, Norma\n> carefully inserted Venport's petrified flowers into her mousy brown\n> hair, a sprig of beauty that contrasted with the plainness of her wide\n> face, large head, and rounded nose. She wore a loose blouse and\n> comfortable hose, both woven from fernfibers.\n>\n> Jostled by other passengers crowded at the shuttle hatch, the girl\n> carried only a small travel pack. Climbing down the ramp, Norma felt\n> flushed and eager to meet the scientist she admired, a thinker who\n> took her seriously. She had heard many stories of Savant Holtzman's\n> mathematical prowess, and she would be hard pressed to contribute\n> anything the great man hadn't already developed. She hoped she would\n> not let him down.\n>\n> Scanning the waiting crowd, she immediately recognized the eminent\n> scientist. A clean-shaven man with shoulder-length gray hair, Holtzman\n> appeared to be in his late middle years. His hands and fingernails\n> were clean, his clothing impeccable and ornamented with stylish\n> designs and badges.\n>\n> He greeted her with a broad smile and open arms that let the sleeves\n> of his white robe droop. \"Welcome to Poritrin, Miss Cenva.\" Holtzman\n> placed both hands on her shoulders in formal greeting. If he\n> experienced any disappointment upon seeing Norma's stature and coarse,\n> unattractive features, he did not show it. \"I certainly hope you've\n> brought your imagination with you.\" He gestured toward a doorway. \"We\n> have a lot of work to do together.\"\n>\n> He steered her through the spaceport crowds, away from their curious\n> stares, then took her away from Starda Spaceport in a private\n> limo-barge that floated high above the graceful Isana River.\n>\n> \"Poritrin is a peaceful world, where I can let my mind wander and\n> think of things that might save the human race.\" Holtzman smiled\n> proudly at her. \"I'm expecting that of you, too.\"\n>\n> \"I will do my best, Savant Holtzman.\"\n>\n> \"What more could any person ask?\"\n>\n> The skies of Poritrin held a gauze of clouds painted citrus yellow\n> with afternoon sunlight. The barge drifted above the multifingered\n> streamlets that wrapped around shifting islands and sandbars.\n> Traditional boats rode the current of the broad river, loaded with\n> grains and cargo for distribution\n>\n> in the port city and export offworld. Fertile Poritrin fed many\n> less-fortunate planets, in return for which they received raw\n> materials, equipment, manufactured goods, and human slaves to add to\n> their labor force.\n>\n> Some of the largest buildings in the spaceport were actually boats on\n> pontoons, anchored to the bases of sandstone bluffs. The roofs were\n> composed of layered shingles of silver-blue metal, smelted in mines\n> far to the north.\n>\n> He gestured to a bluff overlooking the crowded portions of blue-roofed\n> Starda, where she could recognize the influences of classic\n> Navachristian architecture. \"My laboratories are up there. Buildings\n> and supply sheds, quarters for my slaves and solvers, as well as my\n> own home--- everything built into that double spire of rock.\"\n>\n> The floating transport circled toward two sections of stone, like\n> adjacent fingers rising above the riverbed. She could see sheetplaz\n> windows, awning-covered balconies, and a walkway that linked a dome on\n> one spire with a conical stone tower and outbuildings on the other.\n>\n> Holtzman was pleased to note the amazement on her face. \"We have\n> quarters for you, Norma, in addition to private lab facilities and a\n> team of assistants to perform calculations based upon your theories. I\n> expect you to keep them all very busy.\"\n>\n> Norma looked at him, puzzled. \"Someone else to do the mathematics?\"\n>\n> \"Of course!\" Holtzman brushed iron-gray hair away from his face and\n> adjusted his white robe. \"You're an *idea* person, like me. We want\n> you to develop concepts, not bother with full-fledged implementation.\n> You should not waste time performing tedious arithmetic. Any\n> halfway-trained person can do that. It's what slaves are for.\"\n>\n> When the floating barge settled onto a glazed-tile deck, servants\n> emerged to take Norma's bags and offer the two of them cool drinks.\n> Like an eager boy, Holtzman led Norma to his impressive laboratories.\n> The large rooms were filled with water clocks and magnetic sculptures\n> in which spheres orbited\n>\n> about electrical paths without wires or gears. Sketches and\n> half-finished drawings covered electrostatic boards, surrounded by\n> serpentine calculations that went nowhere.\n>\n> Glancing around, Norma realized that Holtzman had abandoned more\n> concepts than she had ever created in her life. Even so, many of the\n> cluttered papers and geometric drawings looked a bit old. Some of the\n> ink had faded, and papers were curled around the edges.\n>\n> With a swish of his wide sleeves, Holtzman gave the intriguing items a\n> dismissive wave. \"Just toys, useless gadgets that I keep for my\n> amusement.\" He poked a finger at one of the floating silver balls,\n> which sent the other model planets into dangerous orbits, spinning\n> about like heavenly bodies out of control. \"Sometimes I dabble with\n> them for inspiration, but usually they only make me think of other\n> toys, not the weapons of mass destruction we need in order to save us\n> from the tyranny of machines.\"\n>\n> With a distracted frown, Holtzman continued, \"My work is constrained\n> in that I cannot use sophisticated computers. In order to perform the\n> enormous calculations required to test a theory, I have no recourse\n> but to rely upon human mental abilities and hope for the best from the\n> fallible calculational skills of trained people. Come, let me show you\n> the solvers.\"\n>\n> He led her to a well-illuminated chamber with high windows. Inside,\n> numerous identical benches and flat tabletops had been set up in a\n> grid layout. Workers hunched over each writing surface using handheld\n> calculation devices. From their drab garments and dull expressions,\n> Norma judged that these men and women must be some of Poritrin's\n> numerous slaves.\n>\n> \"This is the only way we can imitate the abilities of a thinking\n> machine,\" Holtzman explained. \"A computer can handle billions of\n> iterations. We have a harder time of it, yet with enough people\n> working in concert and as specialists, we accomplish billions of\n> calculations on our own. It just takes longer.\"\n>\n> He walked down the narrow aisles between the solvers, who were\n> furiously scribing numbers and mathematical symbols on flat slates,\n> checking and double-checking answers before passing them on to the\n> next person in line.\n>\n> \"Even the most complex math can be broken into a sequence of trivial\n> steps. Each of these slaves has been trained to complete specific\n> equations in an assembly-line fashion. When taken together, this\n> collective human mind is capable of remarkable feats.\" Holtzman\n> surveyed the room as if he expected his solvers to give him a\n> resounding cheer. Instead, they studied their work with heavy-lidded\n> eyes, moving through equation after equation with no comprehension of\n> reasons or larger pictures.\n>\n> Norma felt sympathy for them, having been belittled and ignored for so\n> long herself. She knew intellectually that human slavery was a way of\n> life on many League Worlds, as it was throughout the machine-ruled\n> planets. Nevertheless, she supposed that these workers would prefer\n> doing mental work to heavy labor out in the agricultural fields.\n>\n> With a magnanimous gesture, the scientist said, \"Every solver is at\n> your disposal, Norma, whenever you develop a theory that needs\n> verification. The next stage, of course is to build prototypes for\n> further testing and development. We have plenty of labs and test\n> facilities, but the most important work comes first.\" He tapped a\n> fingertip on his own forehead. *\"Up here.\"*\n>\n> Holtzman gave her a cockeyed grin and lowered his voice. \"Mistakes are\n> possible, of course, even at our level. If that happens, we hope that\n> Lord Niko Bludd is tolerant enough to keep us around.\"\n>\n> *Only those with narrow minds fail to see that the definition of\n> Impossible is 'Lack of imagination and incentive.'*\n>\n> --- SERENA BUTLER\n>\n> **I**n the front parlor of the Butler manor house, Xavier Harkonnen\n> shifted on a green brocaded settee. His duty uniform was not designed\n> for lounging in fine furniture. Ornate gold-framed paintings of Butler\n> ancestors adorned the walls, including one like a caricature of a\n> gentleman with a waxed handlebar mustache and a tricorner hat.\n>\n> Between tight duty shifts, he had rushed here to surprise Serena, and\n> the servants had asked him to wait. Blushing, Octa came into the\n> parlor, carrying a cool drink for him. Though he had always seen her\n> as Serena's little sister, Xavier realized with surprise that she was\n> actually a lovely young woman. With Serena's recent betrothal, Octa\n> might be dreaming of her own marriage, if she could ever overcome her\n> shy infatuation with him.\n>\n> \"Serena wasn't expecting you, but she'll be right out.\" Octa looked\n> away. \"She's in a meeting with official-looking men and women,\n> assistants carrying electronic equipment, a few Militia uniforms.\n> Something to do with her Parliament work, I think.\"\n>\n> Xavier gave a wan smile. \"We both have so many projects, but such\n> times demand it.\"\n>\n> While Octa occupied herself straightening books and statuettes on a\n> shelf, Xavier thought back to a Parliament session he had watched two\n> days before. Upset over the tragic fall of Giedi Prime, Serena had\n> tried to rally representatives from the strongest planets, hoping to\n> mount a rescue operation. She always wanted to *do* something; it was\n> one of the reasons Xavier loved her so much. While others accepted the\n> defeat and cringed in fear that Omnius would push for more conquests,\n> Serena wanted to charge in and save the world. Any world.\n>\n> Dressed in a long gown, she had spoken passionately in the temporary\n> Hall of Parliament. \"We can't just give up on Giedi Prime! The\n> thinking machines have penetrated the scrambler shields, killed the\n> Magnus, enslaved the people, and every day their presence grows\n> stronger. There have to be Home Guard survivors fighting behind the\n> machine lines, and we know that another shield-generator station was\n> nearly completed. Perhaps that can be made functional! We must fight\n> back before the thinking machines can establish their own\n> infrastructure. If we wait, they will become unassailable!\"\n>\n> \"As far as we know, they are already unassailable,\" grumbled the\n> representative from industrial Vertree Colony.\n>\n> The Zanbar official added, \"Bringing the Armada to Giedi Prime would\n> be suicide. Without their scrambler shields, they have no defenses\n> left, and the machines would slaughter us in a direct conflict.\"\n>\n> Serena had jabbed a finger at the nervous audience. \"Not necessarily.\n> If we could slip in and finish the work at the secondary\n> shield-generating complex, then project a new blanket of disruptor\n> fields, we could cut off---\"\n>\n> The League members had actually laughed at the suggestion. Seeing her\n> heartbroken expression, Xavier felt stung on Serena's behalf. But she\n> had not understood the difficulty of her na\u00efve suggestion, the\n> impossibility of restoring Giedi Prime's shields under the noses of\n> the machine conquerors. During his planetary inspection tour, Xavier\n> had learned that it could take days or weeks for engineers--- working\n> under the best of conditions--- to make the backup shield system\n> operational.\n>\n> But Serena never stopped trying. The ache of imagining so many\n> suffering humans drove her to it.\n>\n> The vote had gone overwhelmingly against her. \"We cannot spend the\n> resources, firepower, or personnel on an ill-advised mission to a\n> planet we have already lost. It is now a machine stronghold.\" The\n> nobles feared for their own local defenses.\n>\n> Such work occupied most of Xavier's time. As an Armada officer, he had\n> gone to extended sessions with officers and Parliament\n> representatives, including Viceroy Butler. Xavier was determined to\n> learn what had gone wrong with Giedi Prime's defenses--- and whether\n> he was to blame in some way.\n>\n> Armada tacticians had studied the inspection records and assured him\n> that he could have done nothing to prevent the takeover, short of\n> stationing a full fleet of battleships at every League World. If\n> Omnius was willing to sacrifice part of his robotic attack force to\n> bring down Holtzman's scrambler shields, no planet was safe. But the\n> information didn't make Xavier feel much better.\n>\n> On Poritrin, Tio Holtzman was working hard to improve the scrambler\n> system design. Lord Bludd expressed his optimism and confidence in the\n> Savant, especially since the inventor had brought in another\n> mathematician, the daughter of the Sorceress Zufa Cenva, to assist\n> him. Xavier hoped something could be done quickly enough to make a\n> difference. . . .\n>\n> Lovely but harried, Serena entered the parlor and hugged him. \"I had\n> no idea you were coming.\" Octa slipped out the side door.\n>\n> Xavier looked at the ornate clock on the mantel. \"I wanted to surprise\n> you, but I have to get back to duty. I have a long meeting this\n> afternoon.\"\n>\n> She nodded, preoccupied. \"Since the attack on Giedi Prime, we've all\n> been prisoners of our planning sessions. I think I've lost track of\n> how many committees I serve.\"\n>\n> Teasingly, he said, \"Should I have been invited to this mysterious\n> gathering?\"\n>\n> Her chuckle sounded forced. \"Oh? The League Armada doesn't give you\n> enough work, so you'd like to sit in on my tedious meetings as well?\n> Perhaps I should speak to your new commander.\"\n>\n> \"No thank you, my dear. I'd rather fight ten cymeks than try to\n> dissuade you when you've set your mind to something.\" Serena responded\n> to his kiss with surprising passion. He stepped back, breathing hard,\n> and straightened his uniform. \"I need to go.\"\n>\n> \"Can I make it up to you at dinner tonight? A little t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, just\n> the two of us?\" Her eyes sparkled. \"It's important to me, especially\n> now.\"\n>\n> \"I'll be there.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WITH A SIGH of relief after quelling Xavier's suspicions, Serena\n> returned to the Winter Sun Room where her team had gathered. She wiped\n> a sparkle of sweat from her forehead. Several faces turned toward her,\n> and she raised a hand to allay concerns.\n>\n> Late morning sunlight splashed across the chairs, the tile counters\n> and a breakfast table now strewn with plans, maps, and resource\n> charts. \"We've got to get back to work,\" said the grizzled veteran Ort\n> Wibsen. \"Don't have much time if you want to put this in motion.\"\n>\n> \"That is absolutely my intention, Commander Wibsen. Anybody with\n> doubts should have left us days ago.\"\n>\n> Serena's father believed that she spent her mornings in the bright,\n> cheery room just reading, but for weeks she had been exploring schemes\n> . . .\n>\n> gathering volunteers, expert personnel, and raw materials. No one\n> could stop Serena Butler from devoting her energies to humanitarian\n> work.\n>\n> \"I tried to follow proper channels and make the League take action,\"\n> she said, \"but sometimes people must be coerced into making the right\n> decision. They must be led to it, like a stubborn Salusan stallion.\"\n>\n> After the Parliament laughed at her \"na\u00efve foolishness,\" Serena had\n> marched out of the temporary meeting hall but did not accept defeat.\n> She\n>\n> decided to change tactics, even if she had to organize and finance a\n> mission herself.\n>\n> When Xavier learned of her plan, after it was too late to stop her,\n> she hoped he would be proud of her.\n>\n> Now she studied the team she had gathered from the Armada's most\n> overlooked experts in commando operations: captains, supply runners,\n> even infiltration specialists. Ten men and women turned to look at\n> her. She clicked a remote control switch to close the overhead\n> louvers. The brightness of the room diminished, though muted sunlight\n> continued to filter in.\n>\n> \"If we can reclaim Giedi Prime, it will be twice the moral victory\n> that the machines had,\" Serena said. \"We will show that they cannot\n> hold us.\"\n>\n> Wibsen looked as if he had never ceased fighting, though he had been\n> off active duty for over a decade. \"All of us are more than happy to\n> tackle a task that will have tangible results. I've been itching to\n> strike a blow against the damned machines.\"\n>\n> Ort Wibsen was an old space commander who had been forced to retire---\n> ostensibly because of his age. More likely it had to do with his\n> coarse personality, a penchant for arguing with superiors, and history\n> of ignoring the details of orders. In spite of his surliness he was\n> exactly the man Serena needed to lead a mission that other League\n> members would have declared insane, or at least unwise.\n>\n> \"Then this is your chance, Commander,\" she said.\n>\n> Pinquer Jibb, the curly-haired and still-haggard-looking messenger who\n> had fled the conquest of Giedi Prime to deliver his terrible news, sat\n> stiff-backed, looking around the room. \"I've provided you with all the\n> background material you need. I've compiled detailed reports. The\n> subsidiary shield-generator station was nearly finished when the\n> machines attacked the planet. We merely need to slip in and get it\n> running.\" His haunted eyes grew fiery. \"Plenty members of the Giedi\n> Home Guard must\n>\n> have survived. They'll be doing everything they can behind enemy\n> lines, but that won't be enough unless we help them.\"\n>\n> \"If we can get the secondary shield generators functional, the cymeks\n> and robots on the surface will fall to a concerted defense from the\n> Armada.\" She scanned the others in the room. \"Do you think we'll be\n> able to do that?\"\n>\n> Brigit Paterson, a masculine-looking woman, frowned. \"What makes you\n> think the Armada will join the fight? After my engineers get the job\n> done, how will we make sure the military comes in to save our butts?\"\n>\n> Serena gave her a grim smile. \"You leave that to me.\"\n>\n> Serena had been raised with the best schools and tutors, groomed to\n> become a leader. With so much that needed to be done, she could not\n> sit in a comfortable manor house and fail to use the Butler wealth and\n> power.\n>\n> Now she was about to put that determination to the test. \"Commander\n> Wibsen, do you have the information I requested?\"\n>\n> With his deeply creased face and rough voice, the veteran seemed more\n> like a man of the outdoors than an intricate strategist. But no one in\n> Zimia knew more about military operations than he did.\n>\n> \"Some of it's good, some of it's bad. After crushing the government in\n> Giedi City, the machines kept a robot fleet in orbit. Mop-up work on\n> the ground is being led by one Titan and a lot of neo-cymeks.\" He\n> coughed, scowled, and adjusted a medication dispenser implanted in his\n> sternum.\n>\n> \"Omnius can keep sending in more machines, or even manufacture\n> reinforcements using the captured industries of Giedi Prime,\" said\n> Pinquer Jibb, his voice urgent. \"Unless we get the secondary shield\n> complex working.\"\n>\n> \"Then that's what we have to do,\" Serena said. \"The Home Guard was\n> dispersed across the settled continent, and many of the outlying\n> regiments\n>\n> seem to have gone underground to form a fifth column. If we can\n> contact them, organize them, we might be able to damage the machine\n> conquerors.\"\n>\n> \"I can help with that,\" Jibb insisted. \"It's our only chance.\"\n>\n> \"I still think it's foolhardy,\" Wibsen said. \"But what the hell. I\n> didn't say I wasn't going to go.\"\n>\n> \"Is the ship ready?\" Serena asked, impatient.\n>\n> \"It is, but there's a great deal lacking in this operation, if you ask\n> me.\"\n>\n> Brigit Paterson said to Serena, \"I have secured detailed maps, plans,\n> and blueprints of all aspects of Giedi Prime and Giedi City, including\n> full functional diagrams of the subsidiary scrambler-shield\n> generators.\" She extended a stack of thin film sheets densely packed\n> with information. \"Pinquer says they're up to date.\"\n>\n> With boundless enthusiasm and passion, Serena had always demonstrated\n> skill in putting things together. Two years ago, she had led a relief\n> team to Caladan, an Unallied Planet where thousands of refugees from\n> the Synchronized Worlds had fled. On her most recent crusade, a year\n> ago, she had delivered three space transports full of medical supplies\n> to closed-off Tlulax, where the inhabitants were suffering from\n> mysterious diseases. Now that Tlulaxa flesh merchants had provided\n> medical aid and replacement organs from their biological tanks---\n> including saving her beloved Xavier--- she felt that her investment in\n> effort had paid off fully.\n>\n> Now Serena had called in favors, resulting in a mission that bore some\n> similiarities to her earlier successful efforts. She expected another\n> clear success, despite the dangers.\n>\n> With beatific confidence, Serena looked around the table again. She\n> envisioned the mission succeeding. Eleven people willing to challenge\n> a set of conquerors and overcome the odds. \"We have no higher\n> priorities.\"\n>\n> Ort Wibsen had worked between traditional channels to obtain a fast\n> blockade runner. Paterson's engineering crew had equipped the vessel\n> with the best experimental materials she could scavenge from weapons\n> manufactories. Using personal accounts and falsified documentation,\n> Serena had funded whatever the old commander needed. She wanted the\n> best possible chance for her impetuous mission to succeed.\n>\n> Serena said, \"Every person in the League has lost someone to the\n> thinking-machine onslaught, and now we're going to do something about\n> it.\"\n>\n> \"Let's get busy then,\" Pinquer Jibb said. \"Time for payback.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> THAT EVENING, ALONE in the grand dining hall, Serena and Xavier sat\n> across from each another. Servers bustled back and forth in\n> red-and-gold jackets and black trousers.\n>\n> As he sampled golden duckling fillets on his plate, Xavier talked\n> excitedly about Armada mobilization plans and methods of protecting\n> the League Worlds.\n>\n> \"Let's not talk business tonight.\" With a charming smile, Serena rose\n> to her feet and glided around the table, taking a seat next to him,\n> very close. \"I savor each moment with you, Xavier,\" she said, giving\n> nothing away about her plan.\n>\n> He smiled back at her. \"After the poison gas, I can't savor much else.\n> But you, Serena, are better than the finest banquet or the sweetest\n> perfume.\"\n>\n> Stroking his cheek, she said, \"I think we should tell the servants to\n> go to their quarters. My father is in the city and my sister is gone\n> for the evening. Should we waste this time alone?\"\n>\n> He reached out to brush her arm, then drew her close and grinned. \"I'm\n> not hungry anyway.\"\n>\n> \"I am.\" Passionately, she kissed his ear, then his cheek, finally\n> finding his mouth. He ran his fingers through her hair, touching the\n> back of her head and kissing her more deeply.\n>\n> They left the remnants of the fine meal on the table. She took his\n> hand and together they hurried to her chambers. The door was heavy,\n> and locked easily. She already had a fire lit in the fireplace, giving\n> the room an orange, cheery glow. They kissed again and again, trying\n> to unfasten laces and buttons and clips without breaking apart from\n> each other.\n>\n> Serena could barely control her urgency, not just to feel his intimate\n> touch, but to etch every sensation into her mind. He did not know that\n> she intended to slip away afterward, and she needed something to\n> remember about this night, to compensate for the time they would be\n> apart.\n>\n> His fingers were like fire as they traced down her naked back. She\n> could think of nothing but the moment as she pulled off his shirt.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WITH THE MEMORY of her lover's embrace still tingling along the nerves\n> of her body, Serena left the sleeping manor. She set out into the\n> quiet depths of night, bound to rendezvous with her team at a private\n> field on the outskirts of the Zimia spaceport.\n>\n> Anxious to be away, her optimism subduing her anxiety, Serena joined\n> her ten commando volunteers. Within the hour they departed in a fast,\n> cloud-gray blockade runner loaded with engineering tools, weapons, and\n> hope.\n>\n> *Religion, time and time again, brings down empires, rotting them from\n> within.*\n>\n> --- IBLIS GINJO,\n\nrearly planning for the Jihad\n\n> **T**he conquered planet Earth seemed to be a dumping ground for\n> grandiose monuments that celebrated the fictitious glories of the\n> Titans.\n>\n> Gazing from his vantage at yet another huge construction project\n> designed by the prideful imaginations of the cymeks, the crew leader\n> paced along a high wooden platform. His people were good workers,\n> dedicated to him--- but the work itself seemed pointless. When this\n> ornate pedestal was completed and shored up with reinforced arcs, it\n> would become the platform for a colossal statue representing the\n> idealized, long-lost human form of the Titan Ajax.\n>\n> As one of the most successful trustee humans on Earth, Iblis Ginjo\n> took his job very seriously. He scrutinized the throng of slaves\n> scurrying about below. He had convinced them to be enthusiastic,\n> drumming up their attentiveness through well-chosen phrases and\n> rewards . . . though Iblis hated to waste such loyalty and hard work\n> on a brutal bully such as Ajax.\n>\n> Still, every person had his part in the giant machine of civilization.\n> Iblis had to make sure there were no malfunctions, not on his watch.\n>\n> The crew leader was not required to be here; his subordinate trustees\n> could just as easily stand under the hot sun and supervise. But Iblis\n> preferred this to his other duties. Seeing him watch over them, the\n> slaves seemed to add a bit more to the tasks. He took pride in what\n> they could accomplish, if managed well, and they genuinely wanted to\n> please him.\n>\n> Otherwise, he would spend tedious hours involved in the processing of\n> new slaves and assigning them to various work crews. Often the\n> un-tamed ones\n>\n> needed special training, or resisted violently--- problems that\n> hindered the smooth flow of daily work.\n>\n> Erasmus, the strangely independent and eccentric robot, had recently\n> issued an order to inspect any *hrethgir* captives taken from newly\n> conquered Giedi Prime, in particular any human who showed qualities of\n> independence and leadership. Iblis would stay on the alert for a\n> suitable candidate . . . without drawing attention to himself.\n>\n> He didn't care about Omnius's goals for their own sake, but as a crew\n> leader he received certain considerations based on performance. Though\n> such perks made life tolerable, he distributed most of the rewards\n> among his crews.\n>\n> With a broad face and thick hair that fell across his brow, Iblis had\n> a strong, virile appearance. Able to get more work out of the slaves\n> than any other boss, he knew the best tools and incentives, the\n> manipulation of gentle promises rather than harsh threats. Food, rest\n> days, sexual services from the reproductive slaves--- whatever it took\n> to motivate them. He had even been asked to speak some of his thoughts\n> at the school for trustees, but his techniques were not widely adopted\n> among the other privileged humans.\n>\n> Most crew bosses relied on deprivation and torture, but Iblis\n> considered that a waste. He had risen to his position largely through\n> the force of his personality and the allegiance he engendered in his\n> slaves. Even difficult men invariably succumbed to his will. The\n> machines sensed this innate ability, so Omnius gave him the freedom to\n> do his work.\n>\n> At a glance, Iblis counted half a dozen monoliths around the hilltop\n> Forum, each pedestal containing the huge statue of one of the Twenty\n> Titans, beginning with Tlaloc, then Agamemnon, then Juno, Barbarossa,\n> Tamerlane, and Alexander. An immense likeness of Ajax would occupy the\n> one here, not because Ajax was so important, but because he was\n> violently impatient. Dante could wait, and Xerxes.\n>\n> Iblis couldn't remember the rest of the Titans off the top of his\n> head, but he always learned more than he wanted to know as each statue\n> was built. The\n>\n> work would never end. Iblis had been personally involved in every one\n> of the ostentatious sculptures over the past five years, first as a\n> construction slave and later as crew boss.\n>\n> It was late in the summer season, warmer than usual. Heat devils\n> danced off rooftops around the Forum. Directly under him on the dusty\n> ground, his construction crew wore drab browns, grays, and blacks---\n> durable clothing that required only occasional washing or repairs.\n>\n> Below Iblis's platform, a team boss bellowed out orders. Supervisory\n> robots moved about, making no move to assist the straining laborers.\n> Watcheyes floated overhead, recording everything for Omnius. Iblis\n> hardly noticed them anymore. Humans were industrious, ingenious,\n> and--- unlike machines--- flexible, as long as they were given\n> incentives and rewards, encouraged in the proper ways, guided to the\n> best behavior. The thinking machines could not understand the\n> subtleties, but Iblis knew that each minor reward he gave his workers\n> was an investment that paid off tenfold.\n>\n> According to tradition, the slaves often sang work songs and engaged\n> in boisterous team competitions; they were silent now, groaning as\n> they hauled structural blocks into place though in their habitation\n> hives, workers sometimes grumbled about the labor. The cymeks were\n> anxious to see the pedestal completed so they could erect the statue\n> of Ajax, which was being fabricated elsewhere by another crew. Each\n> segment of the project followed a rigid schedule, with no excuses\n> permitted for lateness or shoddy quality.\n>\n> For now, Iblis was glad his people could work in peace, without the\n> intimidating scrutiny of Ajax. Iblis did not know where the Titan\n> might be at the moment, but could only hope he would prey on other\n> hapless individuals today. Iblis had work to do and a schedule to\n> keep.\n>\n> In his opinion, the monoliths were useless--- huge obelisks, pillars,\n> statues, and Grogyptian facades for empty, unnecessary buildings. But\n> it was not his position to question such time-consuming projects.\n> Iblis knew full well that the monuments fulfilled an important\n> psychological need for the usurped\n>\n> tyrants. Besides, such work kept slaves busy and gave them visible\n> results of their labor.\n>\n> Following their humiliating overthrow by Omnius centuries ago, the\n> Titans had constantly scrambled to recover lost status. Iblis thought\n> the cymeks went overboard, building cyclopean statues and pyramids\n> just to make themselves feel more important. They strutted around in\n> showy but old-fashioned machine bodies, bragging about military\n> conquests.\n>\n> Iblis wondered how much of it was really true. After all, how could\n> anyone question those who controlled history? The wild humans in the\n> unruly League worlds probably had a different view of the conquests.\n>\n> He wiped sweat from his brow and smelled the gritty dust that rose\n> from the work below. He looked at the electronic notepad in his hand,\n> checking the progress against the schedule tally. Everything was\n> proceeding well, as expected.\n>\n> With his sharp eyes, he spotted a man leaning against a shaded wall,\n> taking an unauthorized rest. With a smile, Iblis pointed an\n> \"encourager\" pulse weapon at him and skimmed the man's left leg with a\n> beam of energy. The slave slapped the hot spot on his skin and whirled\n> to look up at Iblis.\n>\n> \"Are you trying to make me look bad?\" Iblis yelled. \"What if Ajax came\n> around and saw you falling asleep there? Would he kill you first, or\n> me?\"\n>\n> Abashed, the man shouldered his way into the crowd of sweating\n> laborers, where he resumed his work with renewed vigor.\n>\n> Some work bosses found it necessary to kill slaves as examples to the\n> others, but Iblis had never resorted to that tactic and vowed that he\n> never would. He was certain it would break the inexplicable spell he\n> had over the men. Instead, he only had to show disappointment in them,\n> and they worked harder.\n>\n> Every few days he delivered stirring, impromptu speeches. On such\n> occasions the slaves received water and rest breaks, giving them\n> renewed\n>\n> energy that more than made up for the time spent. The way he strung\n> phrases together often brought cheers and enthusiasm, and only a few\n> questions from bold slaves who wondered why they should be excited\n> about yet another monument. The work leader's talent lay in being\n> utterly *convincing*.\n>\n> Iblis hated the machine overlords, but concealed his feelings so\n> effectively that his superiors actually trusted him. Now, in a\n> fanciful moment, he envisioned destroying the computer evermind and\n> installing himself in its place. Much more than a mere trustee. Think\n> of it--- Iblis Ginjo, ruler of all, knower of all!\n>\n> He caught himself and dispelled the foolish daydream. Reality was a\n> harsh teacher, like the sight of a cymek on a beautiful day. If Iblis\n> didn't complete the obelisk pedestal in time, Ajax would devise an\n> extravagant punishment for them all.\n>\n> The work leader didn't dare fall behind schedule.\n\n*Each of us influences the actions of the people we know.*\n\n--- XAVIER HARKONNEN,\n\ncomment to his men\n\n> **F**or days, Tercero Xavier Harkonnen stayed up late working on\n> defensive plans for the League. Since his sweet night with Serena--- a\n> sparkling promise of their future--- he had devoted himself to the\n> protection of free humanity.\n>\n> On Salusa he flew practice missions, drilled new fighters, increased\n> the number of picket ships on the system's perimeter for a stronger\n> first defense, and extended the scanning network to provide a better\n> early-warning capability from deep space. Engineers and scientists\n> dismantled and studied the warrior-forms abandoned by the cymeks and\n> left behind in the ruins of Zimia, hoping to find flaws or weaknesses.\n> With each breath in his replacement lungs, he felt outrage against the\n> thinking machines.\n>\n> He wanted to spend more time with Serena, dreaming of where they would\n> go after the wedding, but driven by anger and private guilt about\n> Giedi Prime, Xavier buried himself in work. If he had concentrated on\n> the primary mission there, rather than mooning like a lovesick\n> schoolboy, he might have noticed the defensive flaw and helped the\n> Magnus to prepare. Even encouraging the immediate completion of the\n> secondary shield generator would have made all the difference. But it\n> was too late now.\n>\n> Seemingly inconsequential mistakes could lead to huge events. Xavier\n> promised himself that he would never lapse in his duties again, not\n> for any reason. If that meant spending less time with Serena, she\n> would understand.\n>\n> Emergency staff meetings resulted in a revision of the military\n> structure of the Armada, combining the resources and numerous warship\n> designs from all the planetary militias and home guards. The special\n> defensive needs and tactical significance of each League World were\n> discussed in detail.\n>\n> Armada recruitment surged to new levels. Manufactories worked overtime\n> to provide ships and weapons.\n>\n> Xavier hoped it would be enough.\n>\n> In his office on the top floor of the Joint Staff Building, electronic\n> star maps covered the walls. Printed charts and reports cluttered\n> every work surface. Each step of the way, he obtained the approval of\n> the Joint Staff Commander, who in turn reviewed key elements with\n> Viceroy Butler.\n>\n> When he slept at all, Xavier did so in his office or in the\n> underground barracks. For days he did not return home to the Tantor\n> estate, though his mother often sent eager young Vergyl to deliver\n> meals made especially for him.\n>\n> Oddly, he had not heard from Serena, and assumed the Viceroy's\n> daughter was occupied with vital duties of her own. The two young\n> lovers were alike in their ability to see large-scale priorities . . .\n> and in their independence.\n>\n> Determined to revamp League defenses, Xavier kept himself going with\n> stimulant capsules and drinks. He rarely noted what time of day or\n> night it was, heeding only the next meeting on his schedule. Now he\n> blinked through his office window at the quiet streets and the city\n> lights glittering in the darkness. How long had it been night time?\n> The hours merged with each other, carrying him along like a pebble in\n> a landslide.\n>\n> In the final tally, how much could one man actually accomplish? Were\n> some League Worlds already doomed, no matter what he did? Because of\n> the distances between planets and slow space travel, communication was\n> sluggish, and news was often stale by the time it reached Salusa\n> Secundus.\n>\n> His reliance on stimulants made him feel scratchy and ragged. He was\n> awake, but so pummeled by fatigue that he could no longer focus. He\n> heaved a huge sigh, staring blankly. At the side of the office, his\n> adjutant, Cuarto Jaymes Powder, had cleared a spot on a table and\n> rested his head on the polished wood.\n>\n> When the door opened, Cuarto Powder did not stir, or even snore, but\n> continued sleeping like the dead. Xavier was surprised to see Viceroy\n> Butler stride in, also weary to the core. \"We need to implement\n> whatever you've got ready, Xavier. Funding is guaranteed. For the sake\n> of morale, the people must *see* us doing something.\"\n>\n> \"I know, but we need more than one solution, sir. Have Lord Bludd\n> encourage Savant Holtzman to present any preliminary concepts he has\n> under development.\" He rubbed his eyes. \"If nothing else, we need new\n> options for our arsenal.\"\n>\n> \"We already talked about that last night, Xavier--- at great length.\"\n> The Viceroy looked at him strangely. \"Don't you remember? He has\n> several prototype units almost ready.\"\n>\n> \"Yes . . . of course. I was just reminding you.\"\n>\n> Xavier crossed the room and sat at an interactive information screen,\n> a high-security system that flirted with the dangers of a computer.\n> The electronic summary system could organize and provide vital data,\n> but had no self-awareness. Many nobles--- especially Bludd of\n> Poritrin--- resented the use of even such crude computers, but in\n> times such as these, the summary systems were vital.\n>\n> Passing his hand over the screen, Xavier made adjustments in his\n> report to Parliament, including a compendium of planet-specific\n> appendices, then printed the document, copies of which would be sent\n> to each League World. Presently he handed a neat stack to the Viceroy,\n> who perused the recommendations and signed his approval with a\n> flourish. Then Serena's father hurried out of the office, leaving the\n> door open behind him.\n>\n> At the table, Cuarto Powder stirred and sat up, bleary-eyed. Without a\n> word, Xavier settled into the chair at his own desk. Across the room,\n> the summary screen flashed in an aurora of light as technicians filled\n> it with probing signals to make certain the system exhibited no glints\n> of artificial intelligence.\n>\n> As his aide drifted off again, Xavier dozed as well. In his groggy\n> imagination he dreamed that Serena Butler was missing, along with a\n> ship and military team. It seemed surreal to him, but plausible . . .\n> then he realized with a start that he was not asleep at all anymore.\n>\n> Powder stood at his desk with another officer, listening to the bad\n> news. \"She's taken a blockade-runner, sir! Modified it with expensive\n> armor and weaponry. She has a group of commandos with her. An old\n> veteran, Ort Wibsen, agreed to lead them.\"\n>\n> Xavier struggled to throw off the confusion induced by weariness.\n> After rubbing his scratchy eyes he was surprised to see Serena's\n> wide-eyed sister Octa standing behind the men. In a pale hand she held\n> a gleaming black diamond necklace dangling from a coil of gold, which\n> she hurriedly handed to him.\n>\n> \"Serena told me to wait five days, and then give this to you.\" Octa\n> seemed ethereal, delicate; she moved to his side, but would not meet\n> his gaze.\n>\n> Searching for answers, Xavier removed the necklace from the coil. When\n> he touched the black diamonds, the perspiration on his hand activated\n> a tiny projector that showed a small holo image of Serena. He stared\n> at her, feeling astonishment and dread. The visual seemed to look\n> directly at him.\n>\n> \"Xavier, my love, I have gone to Giedi Prime. The League would have\n> argued the issue for months, while the conquered people suffer. I\n> can't permit that.\" Her smile was heartbreaking, but hopeful. \"I have\n> a team of the best engineers, commandos, and infiltration specialists.\n> We have all the equipment and expertise we need to slip in and\n> activate the secondary shield transmitter. We will complete the\n> construction and install the systems\n>\n> --- enabling us to cut off the planet from thinking machine ships,\n> while trapping the ones that are already there on the surface. You\n> must bring in the Armada and recapture this world. We're counting on\n> you. Think of how much we can help humanity!\"\n>\n> Xavier was unable to believe what he was hearing. The image of Serena\n> continued to speak her recorded message. \"I will be waiting there,\n> Xavier. I\n>\n> know you won't let me down.\"\n>\n> Xavier clenched his hands until his knuckles whitened. If anyone could\n> accomplish such a surprising mission, it was Serena Butler. She was\n> impetuous, but at least she was trying to do something. And she knew\n> her decision would force the rest of them to act.\n>\n> Octa began crying softly at his side. Viceroy Butler rushed into the\n> office, appalled at what he had heard.\n>\n> \"That's just like her,\" Xavier said. \"Now we have to rally a\n> response--- there's no choice.\"\n>\n> *Think of war as behavior.*\n\n--- GENERAL AGAMEMNON,\n\n*Memoirs*\n\n> **I**n an arena under the harsh sunlight of Earth's equatorial zone,\n> Agamemnon prepared to battle Omnius's gladiator machine. The evermind\n> treated these mock combats as challenges for the subservient Titans, a\n> way for them to vent their anger and keep them preoccupied. But\n> Agamemnon saw it as an opportunity to strike hard against his real\n> enemy.\n>\n> Two hundred and thirty years ago, human slaves and contractor robots\n> had completed this semicircular, open-roofed coliseum for Omnius's\n> flashy battles. The evermind enjoyed testing the destructive\n> capabilities of different robotic designs. Here, armored vehicles and\n> self-aware artillery systems could clash under controlled\n> circumstances.\n>\n> Long ago, the genius Barbarossa had programmed an appreciation for\n> combat and a thirst for conquest into the artificial intelligence that\n> had evolved into Omnius. Even a thousand years later the computer\n> evermind had never forgotten his taste for victory.\n>\n> Sometimes these staged competitions pitted humans against machines.\n> Randomly selected slaves from work gangs were given clubs, explosives,\n> or cutting beams and thrown into the arena to face combat robots. The\n> irrational violence of desperate humans never ceased to challenge the\n> calculating mind of Omnius. At other times, the omnipresent computer\n> preferred to demonstrate his own superiority against his cymeks.\n>\n> In anticipation of the next gladiatorial challenge, Agamemnon had\n> spent considerable effort in designing his new combat body. Omnius\n> sometimes pitted his sleekest, most sophisticated models against the\n> Titans; on other occasions, he responded with absurdly massive\n> monstrosities that would never have been viable in any real struggle.\n> It was all for show.\n>\n> Months ago, when Barbarossa had achieved a particularly fine victory\n> against Omnius, the cymek had demanded permission to attack the feral\n> humans as a reward. While the strike on Salusa Secundus had not gone\n> well, the Titans' second effort had conquered Giedi Prime. Barbarossa\n> was even now overseeing dozens of neo-cymeks in the subjugation of the\n> people there, a Titan once more in charge of a world. At last, it was\n> a step in the right direction . . .\n>\n> If he succeeded in winning in the arena today, Agamemnon had plans of\n> his own.\n>\n> With sirens blaring to announce the new event, Agamemnon rolled\n> forward on resilient walker pads and passed between the Corinthian\n> columns of Challenger's Gate. He could feel the thrumming strength of\n> his stepped-up mobility systems, the pulse of increased power surging\n> through his neurelectric pathways.\n>\n> Inside this gladiator-form, his low-slung body core consisted of a\n> pair of reinforced spheres--- one surrounded by opaque armor, the\n> other made of transparent alloyglas. Within the clear globe hung the\n> grayish white hemispheres of his human brain, drifting in a pale-blue\n> electrafluid and connected to thoughtrodes. Faint photon discharges\n> crackled along the cerebral lobes as the cymek body moved forward,\n> ready to fight.\n>\n> Around the double-sphere core, bulky drive motors hummed inside\n> protective cowlings. Engines worked the smooth hydraulics of four\n> grappling legs. Each articulated limb ended with a shifting mass of\n> adaptable metal polymer that could shape itself into a variety of\n> hardened weapons.\n>\n> Agamemnon had constructed this ferocious gladiator-form under the\n> buzzing gaze of watcheyes that monitored his every move. Omnius\n> supposedly filed all such information in a segregated portion of his\n> evermind, so as not to gain an unfair combat advantage. Or so Omnius\n> claimed.\n>\n> While Agamemnon waited, poised for battle, his opponent strode\n> forward, controlled directly by the evermind. Omnius had selected a\n> walking suit of exaggerated medieval armor: two massive legs with feet\n> like the foundations of a building and arms that ended in gauntleted\n> fists as large as the body core itself. The proportions were grossly\n> exaggerated, like a child's nightmare of a bully. Spikes extruded from\n> the massive knuckles on Omnius's goliath robot, and apocalyptic\n> discharges arced from point to point on the thorny fist.\n>\n> Agamemnon pushed forward on armored walker pads while raising his\n> crablike forelimbs, the adaptable-polymer ends of each morphing into\n> claws. Even if he won the contest today, the evermind would suffer\n> nothing, would not even have the grace to be humiliated in defeat.\n>\n> On the other hand, Omnius could accidentally destroy the Titan's brain\n> canister. Unforseen things happened in battle situations, and maybe\n> Omnius\n>\n> --- despite his programming that prevented him from intentionally\n> killing a Titan--- was counting on that. For Agamemnon, this fight was\n> for real.\n>\n> A few designated robotic observers watched from the stands through\n> enhanced optic threads, but they remained silent. Agamemnon did not\n> require applause anyway. The other polished stone seats in the\n> coliseum remained empty, reflecting daylight from the open sky. The\n> large stadium, like an echoing tomb, had all the room necessary for\n> two gigantic foes to clash.\n>\n> No announcement preceded the fight, no information piped over\n> loudspeakers. Agamemnon launched his attack first.\n>\n> The Titan raised his whiplike grappling arms, hardened them with a\n> shifting diamond film, and drove forward on heavy walker pads. With\n> surprising agility, Omnius's goliath robot lifted an enormous leg and\n> sidestepped the attack.\n>\n> Agamemnon lunged with another of his forelimbs, this one capped with a\n> spherical wrecking ball that fired disruptive, paralyzing energy. The\n> pulse thrummed through vulnerable systems, and Omnius's warrior\n> shuddered.\n>\n> Suddenly the goliath swiveled, raising a gauntleted fist to smash the\n> cymek's segmented arm. Even the diamond film could not endure the\n> blow, which bent Agamemnon's forelimb until it ripped from the\n> flexible socket. The cymek dismissed the damage and reversed his\n> walker pads, ejecting the unsalvageable limb. He swung up a cutting\n> arm that metamorphosed into a flurry of shimmering diamond blades.\n>\n> Agamemnon sawed through his opponent's armored torso, severing a set\n> of neurelectric control threads. Greenish fluid sprayed out from\n> chopped lubricant channels. The combat goliath swung his other spiked\n> fist, but Agamemnon danced his walker pads sideways and shifted his\n> vulnerable body core, keeping the brain canister safe.\n>\n> When his swing missed completely, the heavy blow overbalanced the\n> gladiator robot. Agamemnon brought up two slicing arms, hacking at the\n> goliath's arm joints with white-hot cutting irons. He found vulnerable\n> spots with surprising ease, and the goliath's right arm dangled\n> useless, a tangle of neurelectric fibers and conductive fluids.\n>\n> To assess the damage, Omnius dragged his unwieldy fighter two\n> thundering steps backward. Agamemnon pressed his advantage, closing to\n> grappling distance. Then he unleashed his first major surprise.\n>\n> From a concealed compartment within the old-fashioned engine housing,\n> a trapdoor irised open, and eight reinforced conductor-fiber cables\n> sprang out, each tipped with a magnetic connector claw. The cables\n> flew like a nest of startled vipers and slammed into the reeling\n> goliath. As soon as the tips struck home, Agamemnon released a huge\n> energy discharge. Lightning flared up and down the massive body of\n> Omnius's fighter.\n>\n> The cymek general expected this insidious blow to knock the combat\n> robot completely offline, but Omnius must have shielded his fighting\n> unit well. Agamemnon sent another paralytic pulse like a scorpion's\n> sting, but still the Omnius gladiator did not fall. Instead, as if in\n> anger, the machine swung its mammoth gauntlet with the force of a\n> colliding train, putting all of his energy and momentum behind a\n> single blow.\n>\n> The spiked fist struck true, slamming into the transparent\n> preservation sphere that held the disembodied brain. A major jamming\n> surge pulsed out of the knuckle spikes, and a shaped fracture wave\n> shattered the curved glass walls of the protected brain canister.\n> Through the breached container walls, electrafluid spilled like blue\n> gushing blood. Thoughtrodes tore, and the brain fell from its\n> suspender wires, dangling naked in the open, hot air.\n>\n> It might have been the death of Agamemnon.\n>\n> But the cymek general had devised his own trick. The brain inside the\n> transparent container was only a decoy, a synthetic reproduction of\n> his cerebral contours. Agamemnon's actual brain was inside the opaque\n> metal-walled sphere, from which he controlled the gladiator-form. Safe\n> and intact.\n>\n> He was, however, astonished and infuriated. Omnius had proven his\n> willingness to inflict severe damage on the most powerful and talented\n> Titan of all. Omnius's strong urge to avoid losing seemed capable of\n> overriding his programming restrictions. Or had the evermind known\n> about the ruse all along? Agamemnon launched his vindictive response.\n>\n> Even as he spun backward on his walker pads, roaring away as fast as\n> possible, he ejected the now-cracked sphere that contained the false\n> brain. He launched it into the body core of the goliath robot.\n>\n> In his specially constructed body, Agamemnon then ducked down, raising\n> his armored limbs and lowering his shielded brain canister between the\n> rows of thick walker pads to protect himself, like a turtle\n> withdrawing into a shell.\n>\n> The brain sphere struck the damaged gladiator and detonated. The\n> simulated brain had been sculpted from high-energy solid foam. Flames\n> roared past Agamemnon, charring the ground. The resulting explosion\n> bowled over the goliath robot, decapitating it, ripping open its\n> torso. The shockwave was sufficient to knock down part of the nearest\n> coliseum wall.\n>\n> Agamemnon had survived--- and the Omnius gladiator had fallen.\n>\n> \"Excellent, General!\" The computer voice echoed from loudspeakers in\n> the intact portion of the arena, sounding genuinely pleased. \"A most\n> refreshing and enjoyable maneuver.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon still wondered if Omnius had been aware that the visible\n> brain was false. Or perhaps the evermind had found a way to circumvent\n> the protective restrictions Barbarossa had installed so many years\n> ago. Now he would never be sure if the evermind was indeed willing to\n> let him die in combat. Maybe Omnius had to keep the ambitious Titans\n> from feeling too triumphant or overvalued, especially Agamemnon.\n>\n> Only Omnius knew for certain, one way or the other.\n>\n> Amid the smoke and flames rising from the ruin of the goliath machine,\n> Agamemnon raised his gladiator-form, the uncontested victor. \"I have\n> defeated you, Omnius. I wish to claim my reward.\"\n>\n> \"Naturally, General,\" he answered, sounding good-natured. \"You need\n> not even speak your wish. Yes, I shall allow you and your cymeks to\n> lead further strikes against the *hrethgir*. Go forth and enjoy\n> yourselves.\"\n>\n> *Survivors learn to adapt.*\n\n--- ZUFA CENVA,\n\nlecture to Sorceresses\n\n> **I**n the pristine, contoured cabin of the *Dream Voyager*, Vorian\n> Atreides and Seurat cruised between star systems again, picking up and\n> delivering Omnius updates to maintain congruence in the distributed\n> evermind across all the Synchronized Worlds. They exchanged updates\n> with other copies of the evermind, synchronizing the Omnius\n> incarnations, and departing with new data to be shared among the\n> widespread networks. Vor loved being a trustee.\n>\n> Days in space passed, each like the others. The oddly matched pair\n> performed their jobs efficiently. Seurat and the small cadre of\n> maintenance drones assured sterile cleanliness and optimal efficiency\n> in the cabins, while Vor occasionally left food or drink stains,\n> leaving a few items half-finished or in disarray.\n>\n> As he often did, Vor stood at an interactive console in the cramped\n> rear compartment, rummaging in the ship's database to obtain more\n> information about their destinations. He had been taught the benefits\n> of bettering himself in his training among the other privileged humans\n> on Earth. His father's example--- rising from an unknown man to become\n> the greatest of the Titans, conqueror of the Old Empire--- showed him\n> how much even a mere human could accomplish.\n>\n> He was surprised to see that the *Dream Voyager*'s normal route had\n> changed. \"Seurat! Why didn't you tell me we've added a new planet?\n> I've never heard of this . . . Giedi Prime in the Ophiuchi B system.\n> Previously it was listed as a solid League World.\"\n>\n> \"Omnius programmed that destination into our course before we departed\n> from Earth. He expected that your father would have conquered it by\n> the\n>\n> time we arrive. Omnius is confident in Agamemnon's ability to make\n> good after their failure on Salusa Secundus.\"\n>\n> Vor felt pride that his father would tame yet another unruly world for\n> the thinking machines. \"No doubt all will have gone well by the time\n> we arrive, and our forces will be mopping up.\"\n>\n> \"We will see when we get there,\" Seurat said. \"It is still months\n> away.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> ON MANY OCCASIONS they engaged in traditional human competitions from\n> the extensive databases, such as poker or backgammon; other times\n> Vorian would make up a new game, declare a set of absurd rules, and\n> then proceed to defeat Seurat, until the autonomous robot learned to\n> manipulate the rules for himself.\n>\n> The two were evenly matched, but with drastically different skill\n> sets. While Seurat was talented at intricate strategy and could\n> calculate many moves ahead, Vor often pulled off baffling innovative\n> twists to win. Seurat had trouble comprehending the human's erratic\n> behavior. \"I can follow the consequences in a logical progression from\n> an individual event, but I cannot understand how you manage to turn\n> impulsive and illogical behavior into an effective strategy. There is\n> no causal connection.\"\n>\n> Vor smiled at him. \"I'd hate to see you calculate an 'irrational'\n> response, old Metalmind. Leave it to the experts, like me.\"\n>\n> The son of Agamemnon was also quite proficient at military tactics and\n> strategies, a skill he had developed by studying the great battles of\n> ancient human history, as summarized in his father's extensive\n> memoirs. The cymek general made no secret that he hoped his son would\n> become an accomplished military genius one day.\n>\n> Whenever Seurat fell behind in a particular contest, he continued his\n> irritating habit of distracting Vor with jokes, trivia, or\n> anecdotes--- tailoring them to interest the brash young man. During\n> all the time the machine\n>\n> captain had known his human copilot, Seurat had accumulated and\n> assessed information, preparing it for future use. The robot captain\n> had become adept at raising topics that engrossed Vor and sent his\n> thoughts spinning.\n>\n> Seurat chattered incessantly about the legendary life of Agamemnon,\n> adding details Vor had never read in the memoirs: great battles the\n> Titans had won, planets they had added to the Synchronized Worlds, and\n> the warrior-forms Agamemnon had designed for private gladiatorial\n> contests. Once, the robot captain concocted an absurd tale about how\n> the great general had literally lost his mind. The cymek's protected\n> brain canister had accidentally detached from its walker-form and gone\n> tumbling down a hill, while the mechanical body, on automatic\n> programming, had to scamper about and find it.\n>\n> However, Vorian had recently uncovered information more unsettling\n> than anything the robot could ever reveal. Between games and\n> challenges, he often skimmed the open databases, reading his favorite\n> parts of his father's memoirs, trying to make sense of the reams of\n> Omnius's minutiae. On one of those excursions Vor discovered that over\n> the years, Agamemnon had sired twelve other sons. Vorian had never\n> assumed he was the only one--- but a dozen unknown brothers! The great\n> Titan general would naturally have wanted to create descendants worthy\n> of his legacy.\n>\n> Worse, he discovered that each of those dozen sons had proved to be a\n> failure. Agamemnon did not suffer disappointments gladly, and had\n> killed his unacceptable offspring, though they had been privileged\n> trustees just like Vor. The last had been executed nearly a century\n> ago. Now Vor was his father's best hope, but not necessarily the only\n> choice. Agamemnon must still have more sperm in storage . . . and thus\n> Vor was just as expendable as the others.\n>\n> After learning that, Vor became immune to Seurat's attempts at\n> distraction.\n>\n> Now Vor sat at the table, staring at a projected game board and\n> considering his next move. He knew Seurat could not determine what was\n> going on inside the unpredictable human mind. Even with all his\n> independent\n>\n> sophistication, the robot accumulated only external data and did not\n> recognize subtleties.\n>\n> The trustee smiled, just a little, which Seurat did not fail to\n> notice. \"You are playing a little trick on me? Exercising some secret\n> human power?\"\n>\n> Vor continued to smile and stare at the board. It was a multigame\n> competition, revolving inside a three-dimensional screen embedded in\n> the tabletop. Each player attempted to choose a contest or situation\n> that benefited him from a wide selection of games, and then make a\n> move. The score was tied, and the next point would win the contest.\n>\n> The various games came up at random, and each time Vor had only a few\n> seconds to make his move. He watched the shifting graphics as they\n> locked into place momentarily before moving on. The ancient Terran\n> game of Go appeared on the palette of selections; nothing there to\n> benefit him. More options flowed by. A machine-biased game appeared\n> next, one that required more memory than Vor had. He let it pass. Two\n> other games appeared that he didn't like, followed by a poker hand.\n>\n> Relying on luck and bluster, Vor faced off against the robot captain,\n> who could not understand the strategy of bluffing or the \"skill\" of\n> random odds. Vor's expression was unreadable, and he laughed at the\n> confusion he saw on Seurat's mirrored face.\n>\n> \"You lost,\" Vor said. \"And you lost, badly.\" He crossed his arms over\n> his chest, feeling smug after the robot finally folded his hand. \"It's\n> not just the score, but the way you tried to win.\"\n>\n> Seurat responded that he did not wish to play more games, and Vor\n> laughed at him. \"You're sulking, old Metalmind!\"\n>\n> \"I am reassessing my tactics.\"\n>\n> Vor reached across the table and pounded his opponent's slick\n> shoulder, as if to comfort him. \"Why don't you stay here and practice,\n> while I run the ship? Giedi Prime is still a long journey from here.\"\n\n> *Regrets, there are many, and I have my share.*\n\n--- SERENA BUTLER,\n\nrunpublished memoirs\n\n> **T**he cloud-gray blockade runner was not only fast and difficult to\n> see against the murky skies of Giedi Prime, it contained the most\n> sophisticated stealth profile of any craft in the League arsenal.\n> Serena hoped Ort Wibsen's crack abilities would be enough to get her\n> team through to the isolated island in the northern sea, where they\n> could begin their work.\n>\n> Pinquer Jibb had provided the blueprints, plans, and access codes for\n> the secondary shield-transmitting towers, if any of the systems\n> remained intact. But even with the excellent military advisors and\n> engineers, no part of this was going to be obvious or easy.\n>\n> After the long journey from Salusa, they now flew silently through the\n> darkened sky, studying the land mass below.

Sixty, seventy percent chance, I'd say.\"\n>\n> Serena accepted the grim reality. \"That's better odds than the people\n> of Giedi Prime have.\"\n>\n> \"At the moment,\" Wibsen said.\n>\n> Brigit Paterson stepped into the cockpit, not losing her balance as\n> the deck shook in buffeting winds. \"Most of the Armada wouldn't even\n> take the chance.

The\n> gush of steam was followed by hardly a ripple. Then, concealed by the\n> ocean, the craft glided north toward the coordinates of the rocky\n> island where a nervous Magnus Sumi had built his backup shield\n> transmitters.\n>\n> \"I'd say we're sufficiently out of sensor range,\" Serena said. \"We can\n> breathe easy for a while.\"\n>\n> Wibsen cocked an eyebrow. \"I hadn't even started to sweat yet.\"\n>\n> As if to disprove his remark, he fought to control a sudden coughing\n> spasm while he maneuvered the converted blockade runner through the\n> dim underwater currents. The old man cursed his health, cursed the\n> implanted medical injector in his chest.\n>\n> \"Commander, don't jeopardize this mission because of your stubborn\n> pride,\" Serena scolded.\n>\n> The ship pitched to one side and creaked. Behind a bulkhead something\n> fizzed. \"Damn water turbulence!\" Red-faced, Wibsen kept the blockade\n> runner under control, then turned back to glare at Serena. \"Right now\n> I'm just the chauffeur. I can relax as soon as I drop you off.\"\n>\n> The vessel cruised beneath the surface for an hour, deep enough to\n> avoid any floating chunks of ice from the polar regions, and finally\n> guided them toward a sheltered bay. On the cockpit screens, the\n> approaching island looked stark and rocky, all black cliffs and ice.\n> \"Doesn't look like much of a resort to me,\" Wibsen said.\n>\n> Brigit Paterson said, \"Magnus Sumi didn't choose the site for its\n> beauty.

Brigit Paterson nodded, all business. \"Even\n> so, we've got our work cut out for us.\"\n>\n> *In times of war, every person claims to contribute to the effort.\n> Some give lip service, some provide funds, but few are willing to\n> sacrifice everything.

Could there be any other reason why God\n> had granted them such mental powers?\n>\n> Her gaze moved from face to determined face: Silin, the bold,\n> impulsive one; creative Camio, who improvised forms of attack; Tirbes,\n> still discovering her potential; Rucia, who always chose integrity;\n> Heoma, with the most raw power . . . and nine others. If Zufa were to\n> ask for a volunteer, she knew all of her chosen Sorceresses would\n> demand the honor.\n>\n> It was her task to select who would be the first martyr among them.\n> Xavier Harkonnen was already anxious to depart for Giedi Prime.\n>\n> She loved her trainees as if they were her children . . . and in a\n> very real sense, they were, for they were following her methods,\n> maximizing their potential. These young women were so different from\n> her own Norma. . . .\n>\n> Facing the chief Sorceress, the fourteen stood together, apparently\n> content and calm, but coiled within. Their eyes fell half closed.\n> Their nostrils flared as they breathed, counting heartbeats and using\n> innate biofeedback skills to alter bodily functions.\n>\n> \"Begin to build the power in your mind. Feel it like the static\n> electricity before a lightning storm.\" She saw their expressions\n> flicker as their thoughts stirred.\n>\n> \"Now increase the power one bit at a time. Envision it in your brain,\n> but do not lose control. One step, then another. Feel the energy\n> amplifying--- but do not release it. You must maintain your hold.\"\n>\n> Around her in the dimness of the fungoid jungle, Zufa felt the energy\n> crackling, building. She smiled.\n>\n> Zufa sat back on her log, feeling weak but not daring to show it. Her\n> recent difficult miscarriage, expelling Aurelius Venport's monstrous\n> child, had left her drained. But there was so much work to do, so much\n> she could not delay or delegate. The League Worlds were depending upon\n> her, especially now.\n>\n> Everyone had high expectations of the most powerful Sorceress, but\n> Zufa Cenva placed an even greater burden upon herself. At every turn,\n> her plans and dreams had been hamstrung when people refused to expend\n> the effort or take the necessary risks. These eager, talented trainees\n> seemed different, though, and she assured herself that they would\n> perform up to her standards. Too often when she measured other people,\n> she found them wanting.\n>\n> \"Another notch,\" she said. \"Intensify your power. See how far it can\n> go, but always be careful. An error at this point would wipe us all\n> out--- and the human race cannot afford to lose us.\"\n>\n> Psychic energy pulsed higher. The Sorceresses'pale hair began to drift\n> upward as if gravity had failed. \"Good. Good. Keep it going.\" Their\n> success delighted her.\n>\n> Zufa had never been interested in self-aggrandizement. She was a stern\n> and difficult taskmistress, with little patience or sympathy for the\n> failings of others. The chief Sorceress did not need wealth and profit\n> like Aurelius Venport, or accolades like Tio Holtzman, or even a show\n> of attention like Norma seemed to desire by convincing the Savant to\n> take her as his apprentice. If Zufa Cenva was impatient, she had a\n> right to be. This was a time of great crisis.\n>\n> The underbrush stirred as native insects and rodents scampered away\n> from the pounding psychic waves that built to a crescendo. Trees\n> rustled, leaves and twigs fluttering as if trying to break away from\n> their parent stalks and flee the jungle. Zufa narrowed her eyes and\n> studied her students.\n>\n> Now they were reaching the most dangerous part. The mental energy had\n> increased until their bodies began to shimmer and glow. Zufa had to\n> use her own skills to erect a protective barrier against the combined\n> psychic pressure on her mind. One slip and all would be lost.\n>\n> But she knew these dedicated apprentices would never make such a\n> mistake. They understood the stakes and the consequences. Zufa's heart\n> ached as she gazed upon them.\n>\n> One trainee, Heoma, displayed more strength than her companions. She\n> had built her power to a higher level while still maintaining control.\n> The destructive force could easily have become a wildfire in her brain\n> cells, but Heoma held onto it, staring with unseeing eyes as her hair\n> whipped like a storm.\n>\n> Suddenly, out of dense branches high above, a thick-bodied slarpon\n> dropped, a scaly creature with needle teeth and thick body armor. It\n> tumbled among the young women with a crash, disturbed from its\n> predatory perch and maddened by the backwash of mental energy. All\n> muscle and cartilage, it thrashed, snapping with powerful jaws and\n> scrabbling with thick talons.\n>\n> Startled, Tirbes twitched--- and Zufa felt an uncontrolled surge of\n> power spouting like a released jet of fire. \"No!\" she cried and\n> reached out, summoning her own powers to blanket the student's slip.\n> \"Control!\"\n>\n> Heoma, with perfect calm, pointed toward the slarpon as if she were\n> erasing a smudge on a magnetic board. She drew a line of psychic\n> destruction across the scaly predator. The slarpon burst into\n> white-hot flames, thrashing as its bones turned to charcoal, its skin\n> crackling and tearing until it flaked off in puffs of ash. Flames\n> smoldered out of its now-empty eye sockets.\n>\n> Heoma's companions struggled to clamp down and exert their mental\n> forces. But they had been distracted at a critical moment and were\n> losing their slippery grips on their telepathic battering rams.\n> Steadfastly, Heoma and Zufa maintained a superhuman calmness in their\n> midst, a stark contrast to their frenzied efforts. The combined\n> psychic force rippled and undulated.\n>\n> \"Back down,\" Zufa said, her lips trembling. \"Ease the power away. Draw\n> it into yourself. You must retain it and reel it back into your minds.\n> It is a battery, and you must maintain its charge.\"\n>\n> She breathed deeply, saw that all of her psychic warriors were doing\n> the same. One by one they inhaled, and gradually the tingle in the air\n> dissipated as they began to dampen their constant efforts.\n>\n> \"Enough for now. This is the best you've ever done.\" Zufa opened her\n> eyes and saw her students all staring back at her, Tirbes pale and\n> frightened, the others amazed at how close they had come to\n> self-annihilation. Heoma, an island apart, looked entirely unrattled.\n>\n> In a broad circle around them, the soft fungal underbrush was curled\n> and singed. Zufa studied the blackened foliage, fallen twigs, and\n> shriveled lichens. Another instant, a hair's breadth less control, and\n> everyone would have been vaporized in a ball of telepathic flames.\n>\n> But they had survived. The test had succeeded.\n>\n> After the tension finally evaporated, Zufa allowed herself a smile. \"I\n> am proud of all of you,\" she said, and meant it. \"You . . . my weapons\n> . . . will be ready as soon as the Armada arrives.\"\n>\n> *Mathematical answers are not always expressed numerically. How does\n> one calculate the worth of humanity, or of a single human life?*\n>\n> --- COGITOR KWYNA,\n\nCity of Introspection archives\n\n> **A**t Tio Holtzman's extravagant house, high on a bluff, Norma Cenva\n> spent three exhilarating days settling into her expansive laboratory\n> space. She had so much to do, so much to learn. Best of all, the\n> Savant was eager to listen to her ideas. She couldn't have asked for\n> more.\n>\n> Quiet Poritrin seemed so different from the dense, dangerous jungles\n> and lava-rock canyons of Rossak. She was anxious to explore the\n> streets and canals of Starda, which she could see from her high\n> windows.\n>\n> Tentatively, she asked Holtzman for permission to go down to the\n> river, where she had seen many people performing some kind of work.\n> She felt guilty for even asking, rather than working tirelessly on a\n> means to fight the thinking machines. \"My mind is a little tired,\n> Savant, and I am curious.\"\n>\n> Instead of looking at her skeptically, the scientist wholeheartedly\n> endorsed the idea, as if pleased to have an excuse to accompany her.\n> \"I remind you that we are paid to *think*, Norma. We can do that\n> anywhere.\" He shoved aside a sheet of doodles and sketches. \"Perhaps a\n> bit of sightseeing will inspire you to a work of genius. One can never\n> know when inspiration might strike, or where.\"\n>\n> He led her down a steep stairway that clung to a cliff over the Isana.\n> As she stood beside the taller man, Norma inhaled deeply of the\n> river's smell, sour and peaty from silt and vegetation dragged down\n> from the highlands. For the first time in her life, she felt giddy\n> with her own possibilities; the Savant was genuinely interested in her\n> imagination, her mind, and he listened to her suggestions, unlike the\n> constant scorn she had received from her mother.\n>\n> Norma raised an idea that had occurred to her that morning. \"Savant\n> Holtzman, I have studied your scrambler shields. I believe I\n> understand how they function, and I've been wondering if it might be\n> possible to . . . extend them somehow.\"\n>\n> The scientist showed guarded interest, as if afraid she might\n> criticize his invention. \"Extend them? They already stretch across\n> planetary atmospheres.\"\n>\n> \"I mean a different application entirely. Your scramblers are purely a\n> defensive concept. What if we used the same principles in an\n> *offensive* weapon?\" She watched his expression, detected puzzlement\n> but a willingness to listen.\n>\n> \"A weapon? How do you propose to accomplish that?\"\n>\n> Norma answered in a rush. \"What if we could make a . . . projector?\n> Transmit the field into a thinking machine stronghold, disrupt their\n> gelcircuitry brains. Almost like the electromagnetic pulse from an\n> atomic air burst.\"\n>\n> Holtzman's face lit with comprehension. \"Ah, now I see! Its range\n> would be quite limited, and power requirements off the scale. But\n> perhaps . . . it just might work. Enough to knock out the thinking\n> machines within a substantial radius.\" He tapped his chin, excited by\n> the idea. \"A projector--- good, good!\"\n>\n> They walked along the bank until they reached the foul-smelling\n> expanse of mudflats dotted with sloppy pools. Crews of ragged,\n> half-clothed slaves sloshed out onto the mudflats, some barefoot, some\n> wearing boots that extended to their upper thighs. At regular\n> intervals across the featureless field, flat pallets on pontoons held\n> metal barrels. Laborers marched back and forth to the barrels, where\n> they scooped dripping handfuls of the contents and went to plunge\n> their fingers into lines marked in the soft mud.\n>\n> \"What are they doing?\" Norma asked. It looked as if they were\n> embroidering the mudflats with their work.\n>\n> Holtzman squinted as if he had never considered the details. \"Ah! They\n> are planting clam seedlings, tiny shellfish that we raise from eggs\n> filtered out of the river water. Every spring, slaves plant hundreds\n> of thousands of them, maybe millions. I'm not certain.\" He shrugged.\n> \"The waters will rise again, cover the clam plantings, and then\n> recede. Every autumn, harvesting crews dig up the shellfish: clams as\n> big as your hand.\" He held up his right palm. \"Delicious, especially\n> when fried with butter and mushrooms.\"\n>\n> She frowned to watch the backbreaking labor, the sheer number of\n> people wading in the mud. The concept of captive workers remained\n> strange and unpleasant to her, even Holtzman's teams of solvers.\n>\n> The scientist didn't venture too close to the smell and the slaves,\n> despite Norma's obvious curiosity. \"It's wise to maintain our\n> distance.\"\n>\n> \"Savant, doesn't it strike you as somewhat . . . hypocritical that we\n> fight to keep humans free from the domination of machines, while at\n> the same time some of our own League Worlds use slaves?\"\n>\n> He seemed perplexed. \"But how else would Poritrin get any work done,\n> since we have no sophisticated machines?\" When he finally noticed\n> Norma's troubled look, it took him a moment to realize what bothered\n> her. \"Ah, I've forgotten that Rossak keeps no slaves! Isn't that\n> correct?\"\n>\n> She didn't want to sound critical of her host's way of life. \"We have\n> no need, Savant. Rossak's population is small, with plenty of\n> volunteers to scavenge in the jungles.\"\n>\n> \"I see. Well, Poritrin's economy is based on having hands and muscles\n> for constant labor. Long ago, our leaders signed an edict banning\n> machinery that involves any form of computerization, perhaps a little\n> more extreme than on some other League Worlds. We had no choice but to\n> turn to human labor, a manual workforce.\" Smiling broadly, he gestured\n> toward the mudflat crews. \"It's really not so bad, Norma. We feed and\n> clothe them. Bear in mind, these workers were taken from primitive\n> worlds where they lived squalid lives, dying of diseases and\n> malnourishment. This is paradise for them.\"\n>\n> \"They're all from the Unallied Planets?\"\n>\n> \"Leftovers from colonies of religious fanatics that fled the Old\n> Empire. All Buddislamics. They've fallen to distressing levels of\n> barbarism, barely civilized, living like animals. At least most of our\n> slaves receive a rudimentary education, especially the ones who work\n> for me.\"\n>\n> Norma shaded her eyes from the reflected sunlight and stared\n> skeptically at the bent-backed forms out on the mudflats. Would the\n> slaves agree with the scientist's blithe assessment?\n>\n> Holtzman's face hardened. \"Besides, these cowards owe a debt to\n> humanity, for not fighting the thinking machines as we did. Is it too\n> much to ask their descendants to help feed the survivors and veterans\n> who kept--- and still keep--- the machines at bay? These people\n> forfeited their right to freedom long ago, when they deserted the rest\n> of the human race.\"\n>\n> He seemed offhanded about it and not quite angry, as if the problem\n> was beneath him. \"We have more important work to do, Norma. You and I\n> have a debt to pay as well, and the League of Nobles is counting on\n> us.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THAT EVENING, GRIPPING the cool metal of a wrought-alloy railing, the\n> small woman gazed out from her balcony window at twinkling city\n> lights. Boats and barges on the Isana looked like waterlogged\n> fire-flies. In the gathering darkness, flaming rafts drifted out from\n> the slave sector, mobile bonfires that floated into the marshes. Each\n> fire rose and peaked, then diminished as the burning rafts sputtered\n> and sank.\n>\n> Humming to himself, Holtzman came to offer her a cup of seasoned tea,\n> and Norma asked him about the boats. Squinting out at the drifting\n> bonfires, he was slow to realize what the slaves were doing. \"Ah, must\n> be cremation rafts. The Isana takes the bodies away from the city, and\n> the ashes are carried out to sea. Basically efficient.\"\n>\n> \"But why are there so many of them?\" Norma pointed at the dozens of\n> flickering lights. \"Do slaves die that often, each day?\"\n>\n> Holtzman frowned. \"I heard something about a plague traveling through\n> the worker population. Most unfortunate, requiring a lot of effort to\n> replace them.\" He reassured her quickly, his eyes brightening.\n> \"Nothing you need worry about, though. Truly. We have plenty of good\n> medicines shipped here, enough to tend all the free citizens in Starda\n> if we should happen to fall ill, too.\"\n>\n> \"But what about all the slaves who are dying?\"\n>\n> His reply was not on point. \"Lord Bludd has requested replacements for\n> them. There's a standing order for healthy candidates these days. The\n> Tlulaxa flesh merchants are happy to harvest more men and women from\n> the outlying worlds. Life on Poritrin goes on.\" He reached down to pat\n> Norma's shoulder as if she were a child needing reassurance.\n>\n> From the balcony, she tried to count the floating fires, but soon gave\n> up the effort. Her tea tasted cold and bitter.\n>\n> Behind her, Holtzman continued happily, \"I very much like your idea of\n> using my scrambler-shield concept as a weapon. I am already thinking\n> of how to design a field-portable projector that could be deployed on\n> the ground.\"\n>\n> \"I understand,\" she said, her voice hesitant. \"I will work harder to\n> suggest new ideas.\"\n>\n> Even after he left, Norma could not tear her eyes from the funeral\n> barges blazing across the river, the floating cremation fires. She had\n> seen how the slaves labored in the mudflats planting clam seedlings\n> and in laboratory rooms calculating hundreds of equations. Now they\n> were dying in droves from a deadly fever . . . but were easily\n> replaced.\n>\n> The League of Nobles desperately sought to keep from being enslaved by\n> the thinking machines. Norma wondered about the hypocrisy here.\n\n*All men are* not*created equal, and that is the root of social unrest.*\n\n--- TLALOC,\n\n*A Time for Titans*\n\n> **T**he Tlulaxa slaving crew came down to Harmonthep like a weary\n> convoy instead of a squadron of military raiders.\n>\n> Tuk Keedair rode in the lead ship, but he left the piloting and\n> shooting to the newcomer Ryx Hannem. Not yet jaded to the\n> slave-acquisition business, young Hannem would be eager to please\n> Keedair, and the veteran flesh merchant wanted to see what this novice\n> was made of.\n>\n> Keedair had a flattened nose that had been broken twice in his youth;\n> he liked the way it had healed, imparting rugged character to his\n> wolfish face. In his right ear he wore a triangular gold earring\n> etched with a hieroglyphic mark that he refused to translate for\n> anyone. A thick black braid, tarnished with strands of gray, hung\n> between his shoulders at the left side of his face\n>\n> --- a mark of pride, since commercial tradition required a flesh\n> merchant to slice off the braid after any unprofitable year. And\n> Keedair's had grown long.\n>\n> \"Do we have coordinates yet?\" Hannem asked, looking nervously at his\n> control panel, then out the cockpit wind-shield. \"Where should we\n> start, sir?\"\n>\n> \"Harmonthep's an Unallied Planet, boy, and the Buddislamics don't\n> publish maps. We just look for a village and then harvest the people.\n> Nobody's keeping a census.\"\n>\n> Hannem peered through the viewer, searching for villages. The\n> clustered Tlulaxa ships cruised over a waterlogged green continent. No\n> mountains or hills rose above the soggy landscape of lakes, marshes,\n> and waterways. Harmonthep seemed to have an aversion to pushing its\n> land masses much above sea level. Even the oceans were shallow.\n>\n> After a few more runs, Keedair might take a long furlough back on\n> Tlulax, the closed-off world of his people. It was a nice place to\n> relax, though he was sure he'd get restless again before long. As a\n> \"procurer of human resources,\" Keedair had no regular home.\n>\n> The Tlulaxa biological industry had a constant demand for fresh\n> material, generated from new subjects, untapped genetic lines. By\n> imposing a high degree of secrecy on their work, the Tlulaxa had\n> managed to fool their innocent League customers. When the price was\n> right and the need great, the nobles easily swallowed stories of\n> sophisticated bio-tanks that could grow viable replacement organs. The\n> dedicated researchers eventually hoped to modify their clone-growth\n> tanks to produce such products, but the necessary technology had not\n> yet been attained.\n>\n> It was so much easier to just grab swarms of forgotten humans who\n> lived on outlying worlds. The kidnappings would never be noticed, and\n> the captives would all be carefully catalogued according to their\n> genetics.\n>\n> For the time being, though, the sudden shortage of viable slaves on\n> Poritrin had changed Keedair's business focus. As long as the plague\n> continued, it would be more profitable just to provide living\n> captives, warm bodies that needed no further processing. . . .\n>\n> As the slavers approached the tangled swamps, Keedair tapped the\n> scanned topographic map on his console screen. \"Fly low over that\n> broad stream and follow it. In my experience, you're likely to find\n> villages at a confluence of waterways.\"\n>\n> As the craft swooped down, he spotted large dark shapes moving in the\n> waters, serpentine creatures curling through bamboolike reeds. Huge\n> orange flowers bloomed on the tops of the stalks, opening and closing\n> like fleshy mouths. Keedair was glad he didn't have to stay on this\n> ugly world for long.\n>\n> \"I see something, sir!\" Hannem overlaid a magnified display on the\n> windscreen, pointing out a cluster of huts standing on poles within\n> the marshes.\n>\n> \"Good enough, boy.\" Keedair contacted the slaver ships in their wake.\n> \"Just like plucking fruit from a nobleman's garden.\"\n>\n> The marsh village did not look substantial. The round huts were made\n> of reeds and mud, fused with some sort of plastic cement. A few\n> antennas, mirrors, and wind collectors hung between them, although the\n> Buddislamics used little sophisticated technology. He doubted the\n> harvest from this single village would fill the holds, but he was\n> always optimistic. Business had been good lately.\n>\n> Three attack ships flanked Keedair's lead craft, while the Tlulaxa\n> human-cargo vessels were in the rear. Ryx Hannem looked uneasy as the\n> slavers approached the village. \"Are you sure we have sufficient\n> weaponry, sir? I've never been on a raid like this before.\"\n>\n> Keedair raised an eyebrow. \"These are Zensunnis, boy, pacifists to the\n> core. When the thinking machines came, these cowards didn't have the\n> balls to fight. I doubt we'll come out of it with so much as a bruise.\n> Trust me, you'll never see so much gnashing of teeth and wringing of\n> hands. They're pathetic.\"\n>\n> He opened the comchannel and spoke to his harvesting crew. \"Knock the\n> poles out from under three outlying huts and dump them into the water.\n> That'll bring people running out. Then we'll use stun-projectors.\" His\n> voice was calm, a bit bored. \"We'll have plenty of time to round up\n> the valuable ones. If there are any severe injuries, take them for the\n> organ stockpiles, but I'd prefer intact bodies.\"\n>\n> Hannem gazed at him worshipfully. Keedair spoke again into the\n> comchannel. \"There'll be profits enough for everyone, and a bonus for\n> each young male and fertile female you take without damage.\"\n>\n> The linked pilots raised a cheer, then the four raider ships swooped\n> toward the helpless swamp village. Young Hannem held back as the\n> more-experienced slavers flew in. With hot beams, they chopped through\n> the tall poles and let the rickety huts topple into the murky water.\n>\n> \"Well--- open fire, boy!\" Keedair said.\n>\n> Hannem discharged his weapons, disintegrating one of the thick support\n> legs and strafing open the side of a hut wall, setting the reeds on\n> fire.\n>\n> \"Not so much destruction,\" Keedair said, forcing a veneer of calm over\n> his impatience. \"You don't want to harm the villagers. We haven't even\n> had a chance to look them over yet.\"\n>\n> Just as he had predicted, the pathetic Zensunni came boiling out of\n> their huts. Some shimmied down ladders and poles to reach wobbly boats\n> tied up against their hovels.\n>\n> At the edge of the village, the two human-cargo ships landed in the\n> marsh water with hissing splashes, their friction-hot hulls creating\n> steam. Pontoons opened up to keep the ships afloat, and loading ramps\n> extended to solid-looking grassy hummocks.\n>\n> Keedair directed Hannem to land near the scurrying knots of people.\n> Some splashed into the waist-deep water, while women dragged children\n> into reed thickets and young men brandished spears that looked more\n> suitable for catching fish than for warfare.\n>\n> The first Tlulaxa raiders set down gently, extending flat-footed\n> landing struts that sank into the mud. By the time Keedair emerged\n> onto a mound of trampled grasses with his stun-projector in his hands,\n> his companions were already out and opening fire, selecting their\n> targets carefully.\n>\n> The healthy men were marked first, because they were worth the most on\n> the Poritrin market, and because they were the likeliest to cause\n> trouble, if given the chance.\n>\n> Keedair handed the stun weapon to a grinning but intimidated Ryx\n> Hannem. \"Better start shooting, boy, if you want to bag any of this\n> booty.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THE BOY ISHMAEL confidently guided his boat along the waterways,\n> threading his way through the maze of creeks and passages. The reeds\n> were much taller than his head, even when he stood up in the wobbly\n> little craft. The orange flowers at tops of the reeds opened and\n> closed with smacking sounds, feasting on gnats that drifted through\n> the air.\n>\n> Eight years old, Ishmael had been foraging by himself for a long time\n> now. His maternal grandfather, who had raised him after the death of\n> his parents, had taught him well. Ishmael knew how to unearth secret\n> stashes of qaraa eggs that even the giant eels couldn't find.\n>\n> He'd found a good patch of salad leaves and had caught two fish, one\n> of a species he'd never seen before. His basket clattered and jiggled\n> as the venomous creatures inside crawled up and down the walls,\n> thrusting spiny black legs through the tiny holes. He had captured\n> eighteen milkbugs today, too, each as large as his hand. The family\n> would eat well tonight!\n>\n> But as he approached the village, guiding his boat smoothly through\n> the brown water, Ishmael heard shouts and screams along with buzzing\n> sounds. Static discharges. Ishmael paddled quickly but cautiously. The\n> reeds were too tall for him to see anything.\n>\n> As he rounded an oxbow, he saw the slaver ships, one of the biggest\n> fears of his tribe and the reason they had built their village in such\n> an isolated place. Several huts had been toppled, while others were\n> afire. Impossible!\n>\n> The boy wanted to yell and charge in fighting, but better judgment\n> told him to flee. Ishmael watched Tlulaxa slavers pointing their\n> stun-projectors, dropping one villager after another. Some of the\n> people tried to hide inside dwellings, but raiders smashed their way\n> through.\n>\n> The Zensunni had no locks on their doors, no shielded places to hide.\n> As followers of Buddallah, they were a peaceful people. Never had\n> there been war among villages on Harmonthep; at least Ishmael had\n> never heard of such a thing.\n>\n> His heart pounded. Such a loud commotion would attract the giant eels,\n> though the predators were generally sluggish in the daytime. If these\n> raiders did not quickly retrieve stunned villagers who had fallen into\n> the water, the eels would have a feast. . . .\n>\n> Without making so much as a ripple on the water, Ishmael moved his\n> boat closer to one of the raider ships. He saw his cousin Taina\n> crumple from a stun-blast and then be grabbed by dirty-looking men who\n> loaded her motionless body onto a wide metal raft.\n>\n> Ishmael didn't know what to do. He heard a roaring sound in his\n> ears--- his own blood flowing, his gasping breath.\n>\n> Then his grandfather, Weyop, pushed forward to the center of the huts,\n> and faced the chaos. The old leader carried a thin bronze gong\n> dangling from a pole, symbol of his office as the village spokesman.\n> Ishmael's grandfather did not seem at all afraid, and the boy felt\n> instant relief. He had faith in the wise man, who always found a way\n> to resolve disputes. Weyop would save the villagers now.\n>\n> But deep in his heart, Ishmael felt a terrible dread, knowing that\n> this would not end so simply.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> RYX HANNEM PROVED to be a fairly good shot. After the novice had\n> stunned his first captive, he continued with enthusiasm. Keedair kept\n> a mental count, estimating the haul, though he would not have an\n> accurate tally until the unconscious bodies were placed inside stasis\n> coffins for transport.\n>\n> Keedair clenched his jaw as the Zensunnis wailed and pleaded---\n> probably in much the same manner as the population of Giedi Prime had\n> begged during the recent thinking-machine conquest. Keedair had\n> business associates in Giedi City, but he doubted he'd ever see them\n> alive again.\n>\n> No, he couldn't dredge up any sympathy for these Zensunni bastards.\n>\n> Hannem called attention to an old man who stepped forward. \"What does\n> he think he's doing, sir?\" The old man repeatedly banged a metallic\n> gong on a long staff. Hannem raised his stunner. \"Do we take him?\"\n>\n> Keedair shook his head. \"Too old. Don't even waste a stun-blast on\n> him.\"\n>\n> Two of the experienced slavers thought the same way. They broke the\n> tribal leader's staff and pushed him into the water, then laughed when\n> he shouted curses in a mixture of his native tongue and Galach, a\n> universal language among the human planets. The humiliated old man\n> swam to shore.\n>\n> The remaining villagers wailed and wept, but most of the healthy young\n> ones were already stunned and in the boats. Old women and dirty\n> children cried out, but attempted no resistance. Keedair looked\n> knowingly at Ryx Hannem.\n>\n> Suddenly a boy sprang out of the reeds behind them, jumping from a\n> narrow boat. He threw sticks at Hannem and Keedair, yelling something\n> about his grandfather. Keedair ducked. A rock narrowly missed him.\n>\n> Then the boy grabbed a basket out of his boat and hurled it at Hannem.\n> The flimsy wickerwork broke and spilled a swarm of huge spiny-legged\n> insects that tumbled over Hannem's chest and face, biting.

One of them raised its head out of the\n> water and snapped a fang-filled mouth. The sight of the ferocious\n> animal sent a shudder down Keedair's back. Who knew what other\n> creatures lived around here?\n>\n> Anxious to be away from the stinking swamps, he urged his crew to\n> hurry. He watched as the new slaves were loaded onto the ships.

Strong and dedicated, the\n> Sorceress Heoma appeared more than ready to answer the call.\n>\n> From her cliff city on Rossak, Zufa coordinated the operation with the\n> League Armada. The chief Sorceress bit her lower lip and blinked\n> stinging tears of pride from her eyes.\n>\n> Serena Butler's unexpected and ill-advised mission provided the\n> necessary impetus to galvanize the Armada into an offensive. Amidst\n> the arguing and saber-rattling, Xavier Harkonnen had put forth a\n> well-integrated operational plan for the attack. Then he had convinced\n> his commanding officer to let him spearhead the strike. Now, high over\n> Rossak, the battle group of ballista battleships and javelin\n> destroyers was ready to depart from the orbital stations.\n>\n> The initial retaliation against the machine invaders must be a\n> dramatic and complete victory, much more than a localized fight. Each\n> planet affected the others, like the links of a chain. Tercero\n> Harkonnen would lead an Armada battle group, carrying Tio Holtzman's\n> brand new field-portable scramblers to knock out key robotic\n> installations.\n>\n> A Sorceress, though, must deal with the cymeks, whose human brains\n> would be unaffected by the scrambler pulse. Eager for the opportunity,\n> Heoma had accepted her role without hesitation.\n>\n> She was a lean young woman, twenty-three years old, with ivory-white\n> hair, almond eyes, and a plain-featured face that belied the strength\n> and turmoil within her powerful mind. But Zufa knew more than just\n> this woman's\n>\n> mental skills; she knew Heoma as a dear person, a daughter like she\n> wished she'd had herself. Heoma was the eldest of five sisters; three\n> of the others had already been indoctrinated as Sorceress trainees.\n>\n> Zufa stood before her top prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and placed her hands on Heoma's bony\n> shoulders. \"You understand how much rides on this. I know you will not\n> disappoint me, or humanity.\"\n>\n> \"I will achieve everything you expect of me,\" Heoma promised. \"Perhaps\n> even more.\"\n>\n> Zufa's heart swelled. As the straight-backed Heoma boarded the\n> shuttle, the chief Sorceress called after her, \"You won't be alone. We\n> all ride on your wings.\"\n>\n> During the final preparations, with stern words and a hard expression,\n> Zufa had spoken to the strongest Rossak men, chastising them for their\n> inability to play a useful part in the crucial fight. Simply because\n> they were impotent telepathically did not preclude their participation\n> in other ways. The assault on Giedi Prime needed their help as well.\n> With her flinty gaze, the statuesque Sorceress had shamed six of them\n> into accompanying Heoma as bodyguards.\n>\n> The Rossak men brought their personal supplies of stimulants and\n> mind-numbing painkillers, provided by Aurelius Venport. They had\n> undergone rigorous weapons training and learned powerful hand-to-hand\n> combat techniques. When the time came, they would become fanatic\n> warriors, charging into battle with no concern for their own survival,\n> with no goal but to enable the Sorceress weapon to get close enough to\n> the cymeks. Venport had prepared the drugs carefully, creating a\n> cocktail that would keep the men functional through the worst horrors.\n>\n> As she watched the shuttle ascend in a silvery arc to the waiting\n> javelins and ballistas, Zufa's thoughts were in turmoil, full of\n> regret and anticipation. She tried to wall those emotions behind a\n> shield of confidence and a vow of duty.\n>\n> Aurelius Venport came to stand silently beside her, as if he too was\n> at a loss for words. The man was perceptive enough to pick up on\n> Zufa's sadness at seeing her prize student depart. \"It'll be all\n> right.\"\n>\n> \"No it won't. But she will succeed.\"\n>\n> Venport looked at her with a warm understanding that penetrated Zufa's\n> prickly demeanor. \"I know you wish you could have been the first\n> weapon yourself, my dear. Heoma is certainly talented, but *you* are\n> unquestionably more skilled than anyone. Just remember that you're\n> still recovering from your miscarriage, and that weakness might have\n> jeopardized the mission.\"\n>\n> \"And I am bound by the higher responsibility of training others.\" Zufa\n> watched the shuttle disappear into the thin clouds. \"I have no choice\n> but to remain here and do what I can.\"\n>\n> \"Funny. I was thinking the same thing about my own work.\"\n>\n> Recalling the gullible male bodyguards, the Sorceress studied her mate\n> with undisguised scorn. His patrician eyes were incisive, clear of\n> corrupting drugs, but his independent attitude grated on her. \"Why did\n> you not volunteer to join the operation, Aurelius? Or is it not in you\n> to do something selfless, beyond your perception of yourself?\"\n>\n> \"I am a patriot in my own way.\" Venport returned her expression with a\n> wry smile. \"But I never expect you to see it.\"\n>\n> She had no response for that, and the two of them continued to stare\n> blankly at the sky long after the shuttle had reached the stations in\n> orbit.\n>\n> *I don't believe there is such a thing as a \"lost cause\"--- only those\n> without suitably dedicated followers.*\n\n--- SERENA BUTLER,\n\n*address to League Parliament*\n\n> **D**espite Magnus Sumi's optimistic report, the secondary\n> shield-transmitting station on Giedi Prime was not at all near\n> completion.\n>\n> When Serena's covert team landed on the rocky, wind-swept island in\n> the northern sea, they spent a day bringing their supplies and\n> equipment to shore, breaking open the barracks buildings and\n> restarting the power-generating huts. The parabolic towers for the\n> scrambler-shield transmitters stood like frost-encrusted skeletons.\n> But none of the systems were functional.\n>\n> Once Brigit Paterson had scanned the status of the work, the engineer\n> came to Serena with a frown on her wind-chapped face. \"The best I can\n> say is that it won't be *impossible* to complete the work.\" She\n> shrugged her broad shoulders. \"The framework and heavy construction\n> are all completed, but most of the components have not yet been wired.\n> The substations aren't linked, and the cables haven't even been strung\n> to the highest girders.\" She pointed to the ice-slick bars moaning in\n> the breeze.\n>\n> Serena did not envy the volunteer who would climb up there and finish\n> the vital linkages. \"We don't know exactly when Xavier is bringing the\n> Armada for us, but if you're not done by the time those ships arrive,\n> we may as well not bother.

It's a\n> touchy process.\"\n>\n> \"How much time?\" Ort Wibsen asked, chewing on his own impatience.\n>\n> \"A week, if we're lucky.\" Brigit frowned. \"Ten days if anything goes\n> wrong and we need to fix pieces.\"\n>\n> \"Eight days is the absolute soonest the Armada could arrive,\" Serena\n> said. \"That assumes Xavier organized the attack force and launched\n> within two days of receiving my message.\"\n>\n> Wibsen grumbled, \"That'll never happen with the League. They'll call\n> meeting after meeting, then break for long lunches, then hold more\n> meetings.\"\n>\n> Serena sighed. \"I'm hoping Xavier can cut through all that.\"\n>\n> \"Yeah,\" Wibsen said, \"and I'm hoping the robots will all just leave\n> Giedi Prime voluntarily . . . but it's not bloody likely to happen.\"\n>\n> \"Keep your engineers busy,\" Serena said to Brigit Paterson, paying no\n> heed to the veteran's pessimism. \"Commander Wibsen and I will take the\n> blockade runner.

It's a\n> *remote* chance that I'll need any help.\"\n>\n> \"If you say so,\" Serena answered, covering a knowing smile. \"Brigit,\n> you'll be able to detect the Armada when they come into the system?\"\n>\n> \"We're monitoring the thinking-machine communications net.

Looking over his\n> shoulder in the cockpit, Wibsen said philosophically, \"When we started\n> this mission, I thought you were crazy, Serena Butler.\"\n>\n> \"Crazy to try and help these people?\" She raised her eyebrows.\n>\n> \"No--- I thought you were crazy to give me another chance.\"\n>\n> According to his original mapping while guiding the ship through the\n> atmosphere, Ort Wibsen had identified weak spots in the robotic sensor\n> net girdling the planet.

The old veteran didn't\n> answer, but raced across the deck and dove inside the single lifepod.\n>\n> \"What's he doing?\" Jibb said.\n>\n> \"No time to court-martial him now.\" Serena couldn't believe the\n> veteran would just leave them to the thinking machines.\n>\n> Wibsen sealed the hatch of the lifepod and green lights shone around\n> the rim, indicating he was preparing for launch.\n>\n> Serena shot another blast from the starboard weapons, the only ones\n> aimed toward the oncoming thinking machines. She crippled another\n> vessel, but in a united effort, the cymeks and robots fired at the\n> blockade runner, ripping open the weapons ports. Serena looked with\n> dismay at her control systems. They flickered, sparked, went dead.\n>\n> With a lurch and an explosive thump, Wibsen's lifepod shot out like a\n> cannonball. It roared away, a fast-moving, heavily armored projectile,\n> barely skimming over the surface. Over the SOS frequency, the old\n> veteran said, \"Don't be asleep at the switch, now. Be ready!\"\n>\n> Pinquer Jibb powered up their engines, preparing to fly. The ship\n> began to cut a line through the water.\n>\n> Wibsen did his best to aim the lifepod toward the robotic targets.\n> Designed simply to carry a survivor to safety from a catastrophic\n> explosion, the escape vessel had thick shielding and hull plating---\n> and when it hammered into the closest enemy, it annihilated the cymek\n> ship, blasting all the way through and slamming into a second.\n> Battered and smoking amid the sinking wreckage, the lifepod came to a\n> halt.\n>\n> Serena shouted to Jibb. \"Go! Take off!\"\n>\n> He increased thrust, and the blockade runner lifted off from the\n> water, heaving itself into the sky. As they climbed, Serena looked at\n> the imager that showed the water below.\n>\n> In the wreckage of the two thinking-machine aerofoils, she saw the\n> lifepod hatch open. Wibsen emerged, battered but still defiant. Around\n> him, smoke and steam roiled into the air, and three angry cymeks\n> churned toward him.\n>\n> The old veteran reached into his pocket and hurled a dull gray sphere\n> at the nearest cymek vessel. The explosion knocked the enemy back and\n> also sent Wibsen toppling into the lifepod's hatch. He waved a pulse\n> cartridge rifle unsteadily with one hand, shooting again and again,\n> but three armored cymeks pounced upon him from their own aerofoil\n> vessels. Serena watched in horror as their articulated mechanical\n> claws ripped the old veteran to pieces.\n>\n> \"Hold on!\" Pinquer Jibb shouted, too late. Serena saw robotic vessels\n> aiming their heavy weaponry along the trajectory of the fleeing\n> blockade runner.\n>\n> \"I can't---\"\n>\n> The impact smashed Serena against the far wall. Explosions ripped out\n> their ship's engines. The craft began to plunge, Jibb unable to\n> reverse their fall back toward the ocean. The blockade runner careened\n> into the waves like a huge out-of-control sled, spraying up a high\n> tail of white foam. Water began to gush through cracks in the hull.\n>\n> Serena ran to the weapons locker, grabbed a pulse cartridge rifle of\n> her own. Slinging the weapon over her shoulder, though she had never\n> fired one before, she made ready to defend herself. Pinquer Jibb\n> grabbed another weapon from the open armory closet.\n>\n> With clanging sounds like impacting torpedoes, cymeks slammed into the\n> crippled ship. Without even attempting to use the normal access\n> hatches,\n>\n> they cut their way through the hull, ripping into the central\n> compartment like birds trying to get at the tasty meat inside a\n> seashell.\n>\n> Jibb opened fire as the first silvery arms protruded through the split\n> wall. A pulse-bolt damaged the cymek's arm but also ricocheted around\n> the ship's interior, inadvertently blasting the breach even wider.\n>\n> Another cymek came in from the top hatch, prying open the armor and\n> dropping its limber body into the chamber. Serena launched a\n> pulse-bolt, scorching its core. With a lucky second shot, she fried\n> the brain canister. A larger cymek worked its way in from above,\n> grabbing the fallen mechanical body and using it as a shield as she\n> poured more pulse projectiles into it.\n>\n> Next to Pinquer Jibb, a cymek shaped like a black beetle continued to\n> work its way through the hole torn in the hull. The copilot turned and\n> attempted to fire again, but the cymek thrust a long pointed arm\n> forward. Jibb dropped his gun as the robotic arm plunged through his\n> chest like a spear. Blood blossomed from the center of his uniform.\n>\n> The morphing end of the sharp leg shaft suddenly sprouted clawlike\n> fingers, and as the cymek yanked his hand back out of his victim's\n> chest, he tore out the dripping heart and held it up like a trophy.\n>\n> Above, the largest cymek threw the nonfunctional body of his dead\n> mechanical companion at Serena. The heavy hulk crashed down, cutting\n> and bruising her. Trapped, she couldn't move, pinned to the deck.\n>\n> The beetle cymek, blood still dripping from its spearlike limb,\n> wrenched its way through the gaping hull and clattered forward,\n> leaving Jibb's body behind. It raised two more pointed forearms above\n> Serena, but the largest cymek bellowed for him to stop.\n>\n> \"Don't kill them both or we'll have nothing to give Erasmus. He asked\n> for one of the feisty resistance fighters from Giedi Prime. This one\n> will do nicely.\"\n>\n> Hearing his words, Serena was terrified.

But Selim had never seen\n> such a punishment inflicted on any others who had committed comparable\n> mistakes.\n>\n> When he'd been only eight Standard Years old, he had gone exploring\n> out on the cliffs and rocks, hunting lizards, searching for hardy\n> weeds with edible roots. While he was out there a sandstorm had caught\n> him by surprise, hurling dust and grit against the mountains, forcing\n> him into shelter. Selim remembered how frightened he had been, hiding\n> alone for two days. When he'd finally made his way back to the cliff\n> city, expecting to be greeted with relief, he saw that none of the\n> Zensunnis had even noticed his disappearance.\n>\n> Conversely, Ebrahim, the son of a respected tribal father, had too\n> many siblings for anyone to pay attention to him. Perhaps to\n> compensate,\n>\n> Ebrahim got into a lot of trouble himself, constantly testing the\n> limits of the Naib's restrictions while cleverly making sure the\n> worthless waif Selim was around, just in case someone needed to be\n> blamed.\n>\n> As an unwanted scamp, Selim never experienced the parameters of true\n> comradeship. He had always accepted Ebrahim's manipulations at face\n> value, without considering the possibility that the other boy might be\n> taking advantage of him. Selim had been slow to learn his lesson, and\n> did so only after paying the price of exile into the desert, where he\n> was expected to die.\n>\n> But he had lived. He had ridden Shaitan, and Buddallah had guided him\n> to this hidden place. . . .\n>\n> While the long storms made him restless, Selim became more determined\n> in exploring the research station. He studied the banks of\n> sophisticated instruments and records but did not understand the\n> antique technology. He knew vaguely what the systems were meant to do,\n> but did not comprehend how to work the machines that had been\n> installed by Old Empire scientists. Since this station had remained\n> intact for hundreds, maybe thousands of years, it should be able to\n> withstand a bit of tinkering from a curious young man. . . .\n>\n> Some of the power cells were still active, barely, and he was able to\n> switch systems on, make panels glow. Finally he stumbled upon a way to\n> activate a log entry, a holorecording of a tall man with strange\n> facial features, large eyes, and pale skin. The bones of his face had\n> an unusual set, as if he came from a different race of humans. The\n> Imperial scientist wore bright garments, some metallic, others bearing\n> unusual designs. He and other researchers had been stationed here to\n> test the resources of Arrakis and assess its suitability for\n> colonization. But they had found little of interest.\n>\n> \"This will be our last recording,\" said the chief scientist in an\n> obscure Galach dialect that Selim found barely comprehensible. He\n> played the log entry five times before he understood the full message.\n>\n> \"Although our assignment is not yet complete, a new transport ship has\n> arrived at the local spaceport. The captain brought an urgent message\n> of\n>\n> turmoil and chaos in the Empire. A junta of tyrants has seized control\n> of our servile thinking machines and used them to take over the\n> galactic government. Our civilization is lost!\" Behind him, his\n> scientist companions whispered uneasily to one another.\n>\n> \"The captain of the transport ship must leave in a matter of days. We\n> cannot finish our survey work in that time, but if we do not depart\n> now, the continuing turmoil may disrupt travel across the Empire.\"\n>\n> Selim looked at the gathered researchers, with their troubled\n> expressions and distant, glazed-over eyes.\n>\n> \"It may take some time for the political leaders to resolve this\n> dispute and return our lives to normal. None of us wish to be stranded\n> in this awful place, so we will leave with the transport after sealing\n> all systems in our testing stations. Little remains to be discovered\n> in this Arrakis wasteland anyway, but if we ever return, we have made\n> certain that the stations will remain intact and operational, even if\n> the hiatus lasts for a few years.\"\n>\n> As the recording ended, Selim chuckled. \"It has been more than a few\n> years!\"\n>\n> But the images of the long-dead Empire scientists did not respond, and\n> only seemed to stare into the uncharted future. Selim wanted to share\n> his delight with someone, but could not. The desert still held him\n> prisoner.\n>\n> Nonetheless, he would find a way to escape.\n\n*Risk diminishes as our belief in fellow human beings rises.*\n\n--- XAVIER HARKONNEN,\n\nmilitary address\n\n> **S**even days.\n>\n> Brigit Paterson hadn't wanted to cut the time so close, but she worked\n> her crew hard.

In his comline, Xavier heard a report from his adjutant,\n> Cuarto Powder. \"Sir, the thinking machines are coming.

Inside the armored\n> room, numerous watcheyes glared at her through glowing optic threads.\n>\n> A voice boomed out from myriad sources. \"Human--- are you wearing a\n> bomb, a pitifully weak explosive that you think can harm me? Did you\n> bring one of your atomics, or is victory not worth such a price to\n> you?\"\n>\n> \"I am not so na\u00efve, Omnius.\" Heoma tossed her sweaty white hair over\n> her shoulder. \"One person cannot possibly harm the great computer\n> evermind.

If General Agamemnon\n> had conquered the *hrethgir* world, as promised, Vor knew they would\n> find the standard machine-run citadel at the world's business hub. It\n> would be another great chapter for his father to include in his\n> memoirs.\n>\n> Vorian stood behind the robot captain, studying the instrument console\n> as they approached. \"I'll bet there's still a lot of organizing and\n> restructuring to do down there.\" He was excited at the opportunity to\n> visit a world in the process of shifting from human unruliness to\n> efficient machine rule. Omnius would need to install the best\n> trustees, those most loyal to the thinking machines. Neo-cymeks would\n> probably take care of the brunt of the subjugation work, and trustees\n> would come in later, once the people were sufficiently tamed and\n> accepting of their new situation.\n>\n> But Vor also felt a little peculiar. The conquered *hrethgir* on Giedi\n> Prime would look like him, though he would feel no kinship with them.\n> *Seurat, and others like him, are more like brothers to me.*\n>\n> At the command console, the robot attempted to lock an onboard signal\n> onto a homing beacon from the citadel. \"No contact yet. Perhaps all\n> the systems are not yet installed on the surface, or Agamemnon caused\n> too much damage during his conquest.\"\n>\n> Vor tended to the monitoring systems. \"Damage can always be repaired,\n> once conquest is assured.\" Ahead, Giedi Prime was illuminated on its\n> dayside by a pale yellow sun. As he stared, his brow furrowed with\n> worry. \"Something doesn't seem quite right, Seurat.\"\n>\n> \"Define your reservations, Vorian Atreides. I can take no action based\n> upon a vague uneasy feeling.\"\n>\n> \"Never mind. Just . . . be careful.\"\n>\n> The *Dream Voyager* skimmed the upper atmosphere, slicing through\n> clouds and scattered particulates that the ship's scoop system\n> analyzed as copious smoke. Could the *hrethgir* have been so vicious\n> and desperate that they had burned their own cities? What loathsome\n> creatures!\n>\n> His stomach lurched as onboard warning systems whined. Seurat promptly\n> altered course, halting their descent and gaining altitude again. \"It\n> appears the scrambler field remains intact on Giedi Prime.\"\n>\n> \"We almost flew into it!\" Vor cried. \"Does that mean---\"\n>\n> \"Perhaps General Agamemnon did not succeed in his conquest. Giedi\n> Prime is not as secure as we were led to expect.\"\n>\n> Irrationally confident that his father would not have failed, Vor ran\n> a sequence of scans. \"Instruments picking up League military equipment\n> on the surface, evidence of recent massive explosions in Giedi City.\"\n> The words caught in his throat. \"The central hub and the local Omnius\n> have been obliterated! All robots and cymeks appear to be destroyed as\n> well.\"\n>\n> \"I am scanning their broadband reports . . . collating a summary.\"\n> Without alarm, the robot recounted his understanding of the portable\n> scramblers, the powerful Sorceress of Rossak who had used mental\n> powers to obliterate the cymeks, then the overwhelming force of the\n> League Armada.\n>\n> Then Seurat said in a maddeningly calm voice, \"Vorian, a fleet of\n> *hrethgir* ships is coming around from behind the planet. They appear\n> to have been waiting for us in ambush.\"\n>\n> Outside, streaks of orange and blue tracer fire came close to hitting\n> the update craft, and the *Dream Voyager*'s automatic systems jolted\n> into\n>\n> evasive maneuvers. League kindjals streaked in like wolves. \"They're\n> barbarians,\" Vor said. \"Eager to destroy anything they don't like.\"\n>\n> Seurat said, \"We are under attack. And the *Dream Voyager* is not a\n> combat-programmed vessel.\" He continued to sound artificially jovial,\n> facetiously this time. \"Someday I will think of a joke about why it\n> takes so many humans to short-circuit an Omnius.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> ALERTED TO THE approach of a single thinking-machine vessel, Tercero\n> Xavier Harkonnen had moved his orbital battle group to the far side of\n> the planet. Some wreckage of robot warships still tumbled in a\n> dispersing swath; Omnius's forces had been completely destroyed.\n>\n> Xavier flew out in a personal kindjal, accompanied by a well-armed\n> squadron. He saw the update ship roar on a steep trajectory toward the\n> damaged main city, then swerve desperately upward as soon as the robot\n> captain detected the scrambler fields. \"Follow me! We can't let it get\n> away.\"\n>\n> Hungry for vengeance, his squadron hurled itself into the pursuit. At\n> the same time, he signaled the ground-based military forces that he\n> had an enemy craft in sight. Ahead, wavering in the crosshairs, the\n> *Dream Voyager* surged forward, trying to evade Armada weapons fire\n> and to escape back into space.\n>\n> Abruptly, Xavier was startled to hear a human voice--- or one that\n> *sounded* human--- coming over the comline. \"Hey, break off your\n> attack! This is a League ship. My name is Vorian Atreides. We have\n> boarded a machine craft and taken control. Stop trying to shoot us\n> down!\"\n>\n> Xavier tried to determine from the tenor if it really was a human\n> voice, or only a clever machine copy. Thinking machines were not\n> devious . . . unless there was a preserved cymek brain aboard. Some of\n> the kindjals dropped back, uncertain.\n>\n> \"Stay on your guard,\" Xavier said to his squadron, \"but cease fire\n> until we figure this out---\"\n>\n> Before he could finish his order, the suspicious ship looped and began\n> firing its own weapons, minimal defensive volleys that nevertheless\n> took the Armada fighters by surprise. One kindjal veered away, its\n> engines damaged.\n>\n> Xavier's console screen showed the image of a human face with dark\n> hair and shining fanatical eyes. A sleek, mirror-faced robot stood\n> next to him, his flexible copperfilm body rippling as he operated the\n> controls of the ship.\n>\n> *A human and a robot, working side by side?* Xavier couldn't believe\n> it.\n>\n> \"Open fire!\" he shouted. \"Destroy that ship.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> \"IT IS NOT wise to provoke them too much, Vorian,\" Seurat said,\n> maddeningly calm. \"I would rather leave here posthaste.\"\n>\n> \"I just gained us a few precious seconds, didn't I? You wouldn't have\n> thought of using a bluff.\" Vor couldn't stop grinning. He had read\n> similar words in the memoirs of Agamemnon and was glad to echo them.\n>\n> As the Armada commander took evasive maneuvers and rallied his kindjal\n> pilots, he hurled insults back at Vor on the comline. \"You are a\n> disgrace to humanity, a traitor!\"\n>\n> Vor laughed, proud of his place here. He quoted what he'd been taught\n> all his life. \"I am the pinnacle of humanity--- a trustee of Omnius,\n> the son of General Agamemnon.\"\n>\n> \"I apologize for interrupting your grand speech, Vorian, but I am\n> detecting more *hrethgir* ships,\" the robot said. \"More than we can\n> evade. Therefore, I am breaking off engagement. Our responsibility is\n> to protect the updates aboard. We have to make our report.\"\n>\n> Vor said grimly, \"If the Giedi Prime-- Omnius is already destroyed, we\n> will never have an update of what it did during its months of\n> operation here. We'll never know what he accomplished.\"\n>\n> \"A grievous loss,\" Seurat said.\n>\n> The robot guided the *Dream Voyager* toward orbit, farther from the\n> deadly scrambler fields. The acceleration pressed Vorian back into his\n> padded seat until he nearly lost consciousness. A squadron of\n> human-operated ships closed in on their tail, and the update ship\n> shuddered as an energy pulse hit the aft section.\n>\n> Seurat dodged, and another volley of blows pounded the hull, damaging\n> the armor plates. This vessel was not made to endure such punishment.\n> Vor heard onboard systems hissing, automated routines making temporary\n> repairs to the damaged parts. Another blast hit, even worse than the\n> others.\n>\n> \"We are operating on reserves,\" Seurat announced. Vor scanned the\n> ship's diagnostics himself, assessing the damage. The air in the cabin\n> began to smell acrid and smoky.\n>\n> The *Dream Voyager* lurched. More kindjals surrounded them, targeting\n> their engines. An explosion jarred Vor to his bones.\n>\n> \"We cannot tolerate much more of this,\" Seurat said. \"Our engines are\n> functioning at only a third of normal capacity, and I am flying as\n> fast as I can.\"\n>\n> \"Head into that high cloud,\" Vor said, as an idea suddenly occurred to\n> him. \"The water vapor is thick enough to act as a projection surface.\"\n>\n> Listening to his enthusiastic copilot, Seurat steered into a giant,\n> towering cloud. The damaged engines strained. More blows came from the\n> pursuing kindjals.\n>\n> Vor worked furiously at the controls, using the ship's sophisticated\n> systems to project virtual copies in its wake, electronic images of\n> the *Dream*\n>\n> *Voyager*. He had hoped to use the scheme in a tactical game with\n> Seurat . . . but this was a different sort of game. If it didn't work,\n> the already-damaged update ship would never survive.\n>\n> Moments later a hundred illusory *Dream Voyagers* seemed to surge\n> through the cloud, solido images reflected on the water vapor.\n> Momentarily confused, the pursuing squadron chased decoys.\n>\n> And the real prey limped away, its pilots stealing up into orbit and\n> hoping to remain unnoticed until they could get out of range. . . .\n>\n> *Even the expected can be a terrible shock when we have been holding\n> on to threads of hope.*\n>\n> --- XAVIER HARKONNEN\n>\n> **W**hile the survivors of Giedi Prime counted their dead, documented\n> the damage, and made plans for the future, Xavier felt hope fading. It\n> seemed that no one on the whole world had seen Serena Butler since\n> she'd departed from the island compound in the northern sea.\n>\n> He took twice his normal shifts aboard scout kindjals, flying regular\n> patterns over the settled continents, where thinking machines had\n> caused the most destruction. If Serena was alive, Xavier knew she\n> would never be hiding. Rather, the determined young woman would be in\n> the midst of the hardest work, taking charge as always.\n>\n> Flying eastward on the next scheduled search pattern, he watched the\n> yellow sun set behind him, leaving splashes of gold and orange in its\n> wake. A powerful gust buffeted his craft, and he fought to control it.\n> Xavier rose to a less-turbulent altitude above the jet-stream, while\n> his squadron followed him.\n>\n> Someday, after he and Serena were married, he could tell this story to\n> their children. His chest tightened at the thought, but he continued\n> his search, not daring to consider what he would do if something had\n> happened to her.\n>\n> From this altitude, Xavier could make out the major geographical\n> outlines of continents and seas as they soaked up the approaching\n> night. Through a powerful scope, he saw the center of a city and made\n> out clusters of lights marking human encampments. During their brief\n> and brutal rule, the machine conquerors had slaughtered countless\n> people and sent millions fleeing into the countryside.\n>\n> Now survivors began to filter back to their homes. Construction crews\n> had moved into the industrial complexes, where they ripped out machine\n> modifications and reestablished the production capacities that were\n>\n> necessary to repair dwelling units and distribute food and supplies.\n> Back in Giedi City, Armada experts pored over the ruined Omnius\n> citadel, analyzing the debris from the high-thermal attack. Only\n> scraps of twisted, burned-out hardware and an electronic signaling\n> mechanism remained.\n>\n> But full recovery would take a great deal of time.\n>\n> Xavier hated machines more than anything, but he also believed in\n> honor among men. He could not understand the turncoat Vorian Atreides,\n> who willingly flew beside a robot captain in a thinking-machine spy\n> ship. Brainwashed, obviously, but something in the young man's\n> arrogant demeanor suggested deep convictions . . . a fanatical,\n> single-minded passion. Atreides had claimed to be the \"son\" of\n> Agamemnon, the worst of the cymek Titans.\n>\n> Below, one of the squadron ships veered toward the water in the vast,\n> open sea. \"Tercero Harkonnen, I'm detecting debris in the water below.\n> Metallic wreckage of some sort.\"\n>\n> With sudden dread, Xavier said, \"Check it out.\"\n>\n> Two kindjals swooped down to the open sea. One pilot transmitted, \"The\n> mass and configuration suggests that it's the remains of a League ship\n> with military-grade armor. Maybe a blockade runner.\"\n>\n> \"Did we lose any ships of that type in our engagement?\" \"No, sir.\"\n>\n> \"Retrieve the wreckage,\" Xavier commanded, surprised at how steady his\n> voice sounded. \"We'll run an analysis.\" He didn't want to say it, but\n> knew that Serena and her team had taken such a craft out onto the open\n> sea, when departing from the transmitter facility.\n>\n> He thought of the shimmering image of Serena projected from the black\n> diamond necklace that Octa had given him. The memory was so sharp that\n> the achingly beautiful woman seemed to be standing in front of him\n> again,\n>\n> proud and determined with her misguided idea of helping the people of\n> Giedi Prime.\n>\n> As the crews gathered the scattered debris, Xavier saw that the hull\n> had been painted an unobtrusive gray with a film of stealth coating,\n> now blistered and peeled.\n>\n> He felt numb. \"We have to make certain, one way or the other.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> LATER, WHEN THE debris had been delivered to a temporary military\n> encampment in Giedi City, Xavier Harkonnen ordered a full examination\n> on any traces found in the interior of the destroyed craft. Other\n> parts of the wreckage seemed to have come from robotic aerofoils, but\n> he didn't care about that. His mind and body were numb with dread; the\n> conclusions seemed inescapable.\n>\n> Inside a battered lifepod not far from the downed blockade runner, the\n> recovery team also found the mangled remains of an old man, identified\n> as Ort Wibsen. All doubt dissipated. This had been Serena's vessel.\n>\n> They found more blood inside the waterlogged ship. Obviously they had\n> put up an extraordinary fight at the end. Xavier ran full DNA scans,\n> hoping for any result other than the one he feared most.\n>\n> But the results proved that the other victims had been the Home Guard\n> messenger Pinquer Jibb . . . and Serena Butler herself.\n>\n> *Serena. My love . . .*\n>\n> Hanging his head, Xavier tried to hold on to the unraveling strands of\n> hope. Perhaps the machines had only taken Serena prisoner. But that\n> was a ridiculously unrealistic possibility . . . and given cymek and\n> robot brutality, would that be a fate he could wish for?\n>\n> No, he would have to return to Salusa Secundus and deliver the news to\n> a distraught Manion Butler.\n>\n> There could be no doubt about it: Serena must be dead.\n>\n> *Whether we are rich, poor, strong, weak, intelligent, or stupid, the\n> thinking machines treat us as nothing more than meat.

These captives had been freshly harvested from Giedi Prime and\n> brought to Earth by order of Omnius. The work boss groaned inwardly,\n> suspecting that the cymeks would want to build another enormous\n> monument to celebrate the Giedi Prime victory, too, and his crews\n> would have to build it. . . .\n>\n> Erasmus supposedly had his eye on one female in particular, personally\n> selected for him by the Titan Barbarossa. Iblis had read the\n> documentation, knew that the new batch of prisoners might be an unruly\n> lot, considering where they had been captured.\n>\n> As the disheveled and disoriented slaves were herded off the space\n> transport in dirty clothes, Iblis perused them with a trained eye,\n> considering how to segregate them to work assignments, a few artisans,\n> a few skilled workers, most of them mere slaves. He separated out a\n> muscular, mahogany-skinned man for assignment to the Ajax pedestal\n> project, smiling encouragement to him, then dispatched others to crews\n> that required more manpower.\n>\n> One of the last to emerge from the ship was a battered woman who,\n> despite the dark bruises on her face and arms and the weary shock in\n> her expression, carried herself with pride, showing internal strength\n> in every movement. This was the one for Erasmus. *Trouble*.\n>\n> Why would the robot be interested in her? He would probably just\n> vivisect her anyway. A waste. And a shame.\n>\n> Iblis called to her, but she ignored his gentle yet authoritative\n> tone. Finally, with some rough encouragement from the guard robots,\n> she stood in front of him. Though only of average height, the female\n> had striking lavender eyes, amber-brown hair, and a face that might be\n> pretty if cleansed of grime and anger.\n>\n> He smiled warmly, trying to reach out to her with a little charm. \"The\n> records say your name is Serena Linn\u00e9?\" He knew full well who she was.\n>\n> Iblis stared into her eyes and detected a spark of defiance there. She\n> held his gaze, as if she were his equal. \"Yes. My father was a minor\n> official in Giedi City, moderately well-off.\"\n>\n> \"Have you ever worked as a servant before?\" he inquired.\n>\n> \"I have always been a servant--- of the people.\"\n>\n> \"From now on, you serve Omnius.\" He softened his voice. \"I promise\n> you, it won't be so bad. Our workers are treated well here. Especially\n> intelligent ones like yourself. Perhaps you could even aspire to a\n> trusted, privileged position, if you have the intelligence and the\n> personality for it.\" Iblis smiled. \"However, wouldn't it be best if we\n> used your true name . . . Serena Butler?\"\n>\n> She glared at him. At least she didn't deny it. \"How did you know?\"\n>\n> \"After capturing you, Barbarossa inspected the wreckage of your\n> vessel. There were many clues aboard. You are fortunate the cymeks\n> never needed to interrogate you in further detail.\" He glanced at his\n> electronic notes. \"We know you are the daughter of Viceroy Manion\n> Butler. Were you trying to hide your identity out of fear that Omnius\n> might use you in some sort of blackmail scheme? I assure you, that\n> isn't the way the evermind thinks. Omnius would never have considered\n> such a thing.\"\n>\n> She raised her chin defiantly. \"My father would never surrender a\n> centimeter of territory, no matter what the machines do to me.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, yes, you're all very brave, I am sure.\" Iblis gave her a wry\n> smile, meant to be comforting. \"The rest is up to the robot Erasmus.\n> He has requested that you be assigned to his villa. He has taken a\n> particular interest in your circumstances. That's a good sign.\"\n>\n> \"He wishes to help me?\"\n>\n> \"I wouldn't go that far,\" he said with a hint of humor. \"I'm sure\n> Erasmus wants to *talk* with you. And talk and talk and talk. In the\n> end, it's quite likely he will drive you mad with his famous\n> curiosity.\"\n>\n> Iblis instructed other slaves to clean and properly reclothe this\n> female, and they followed the trustee's orders as if he were a machine\n> himself. Although her mannerisms exuded hostility and resentment,\n> Serena Butler did not waste effort on pointless resistance. She had a\n> brain, but her intelligence and spirit were bound to be crushed before\n> long.\n>\n> The routine medical check, however, revealed a surprise. She glared at\n> Iblis, trying to maintain her defensive wall of anger, but a glimmer\n> of curiosity flickered behind her odd lavender eyes. \"Are you aware\n> that you're pregnant? Or is that just an unfortunate accident?\" From\n> the way she reeled, he saw that her reaction was not feigned. \"Yes, by\n> now it appears about three months along. You must have suspected.\"\n>\n> \"That is none of your business.\" Her words were hard, as if she was\n> trying to maintain her hold on something stable. The news seemed to be\n> a greater blow to her than all the rough treatment she had endured\n> since capture.\n>\n> Iblis made a dismissive gesture. \"Every cell in your body is my\n> business--- at least until I deliver you to your new master.\n> Afterward, I will really begin to pity you.\"\n>\n> The independent robot would no doubt plan interesting experiments on\n> her and the fetus. . . .\n>\n> *The psychology of the human animal is malleable, with his personality\n> dependent upon the proximity of other members of the species and the\n> pressures exerted by them.*\n>\n> --- ERASMUS,\n\nlaboratory notes\n\n> **E**rasmus's villa stood as a towering edifice on a hilltop\n> overlooking the sea. On the inland side, the main building loomed high\n> in front of a lovely flagstone square beneath high turrets; toward the\n> coast, a cluster of bleak, crowded slave pens huddled on the opposite\n> side, where human captives lived like livestock.\n>\n> From the highest balconies, the robot found the dichotomy curious.\n>\n> Forming his metal polymer facefilm into a paternal mask, Erasmus\n> watched as two sentinel robots strode through a slave pen, hunting for\n> twin girls that he required for a new round of experiments. The\n> panicked humans scrambled away, but Erasmus didn't shift his pliable\n> face into a frown. His myriad optic threads scanned the lean and dirty\n> forms, assessing.\n>\n> He had seen the little girls a few days before, noting their short\n> black hair and brown eyes, but they seemed to be hiding somewhere.\n> Playing a game with him? The sentinels tore through a doorway into a\n> tunnel that led to another pen; finally, they transmitted back, \"We\n> have located the two subjects.\"\n>\n> *Good*, Erasmus thought, anticipating the intriguing work ahead. He\n> wanted to see if he could force one of the twin girls to kill the\n> other. It would be a landmark experiment, one that would reveal\n> important insights into moral boundaries and how siblings defined\n> them.\n>\n> He especially enjoyed working with identical twins. Over the years he\n> had processed dozens of pairs through his laboratory, compiling\n> detailed medical reports as well as intensive psychological studies.\n> He spent a great\n>\n> deal of effort on meticulous comparative autopsies, microanalyzing the\n> subtle differences in siblings who were genetic carbon-copies. The\n> slave masters working in the crowded pens had instructions to identify\n> and select any new sets among the captive populace on Earth.\n>\n> Finally, the squirming dark-haired twins stood in front of him, held\n> by the sentinel robots. He shifted his pliable facefilm into a calm\n> smile. One of the girls spat on the reflective surface. Erasmus\n> wondered why saliva carried such a negative connotation for humans? It\n> caused no damage and could be cleaned off easily. The forms of human\n> defiance never ceased to amaze him.\n>\n> Shortly before Erasmus had left his estate on Corrin, twenty-two\n> slaves had removed their protective eye films and intentionally stared\n> into the furious red-giant sun, blinding themselves. Disobedient,\n> resistant--- and stupid. What did the rebellious act accomplish, other\n> than rendering them useless for slave work?\n>\n> They had expected to be killed, and Erasmus would oblige them. But not\n> so that they could become martyrs. Instead, he had quietly separated\n> them from other workers to prevent the spread of their unruliness.\n> Blinded, they could not find or earn food. By now, he supposed they\n> must have starved in their self-inflicted darkness.\n>\n> Still, he had marveled at their spirit, their collective will to\n> challenge him. Even though humans were a troublesome breed, they were\n> constantly fascinating.\n>\n> A watcheye buzzed nearby, making strange, raw noises. Finally, Omnius\n> spoke through it. \"The recent loss of Giedi Prime is your fault,\n> Erasmus. I tolerate your endless experiments in the hope that you will\n> deconstruct and analyze human behavior. Why did you not predict the\n> suicidal raid that obliterated my cymeks? The data and experiences of\n> my Giedi Prime counterpart were never backed up. Barbarossa is equally\n> irreplaceable, since he created my original programming.\"\n>\n> The Earth-Omnius already knew about the recapture of Giedi Prime\n> because of an automated emergency buoy launched by the robot Seurat,\n> whose update ship had unexpectedly encountered the disaster in its\n> duties. The alarming message had reached Earth only that morning.\n>\n> \"I was not given data that the Sorceresses of Rossak had developed\n> this capability of telepathic destruction.\" The robot's face shimmered\n> back into its blank oval smoothness. \"Why not also ask your questions\n> of Vorian Atreides when he returns to Earth? The son of Agamemnon has\n> helped us to simulate unstable human behavior before.\"\n>\n> Omnius said, \"Even his input could not have prepared us for what\n> happened to Giedi Prime. Sentient biologicals are unpredictable and\n> reckless.\"\n>\n> As the sentinel robots dragged the squirming twins away, Erasmus\n> directed his attention to the watcheye. \"Then it is obvious I have\n> more work to do.\"\n>\n> \"No, Erasmus, it is obvious that your research is not yielding the\n> desired results. You should strive for perfection, rather than\n> investigating compounded errors. I recommend that you overwrite your\n> mind core with a subset of my program. Turn yourself into a perfect\n> machine. A copy of me.\"\n>\n> \"You would sacrifice our fascinating, open-ended debates?\" Erasmus\n> responded, fighting to conceal his inner alarm. \"You have always\n> expressed an interest in my peculiar manner of thinking. All the\n> everminds especially look forward to your record of my actions.\"\n>\n> The buzzing of the watcheye intensified, indicating that Omnius was\n> shifting his thought pathways. This was a worrisome, volatile\n> situation. Erasmus did not want to lose his carefully developed\n> independent identity.\n>\n> One of the twin girls tried to break away from the robotic guards and\n> run back toward the dubious safety of the pens. As Erasmus had\n> suggested beforehand, the guard lifted her sister by one arm, leaving\n> her to dangle screaming. The free twin hesitated, though she could\n> easily have reached the temporary shelter. Slowly, she came to a stop,\n> surrendering.\n>\n> *Fascinating*, Erasmus thought. And the sentinel robot did not even\n> have to inflict cellular damage on the other girl.\n>\n> Thinking quickly, the robot said, \"Perhaps if I diverted my attention\n> to matters of military significance, you would more easily see the\n> potential of my work. Let me understand the mentality of these wild\n> humans for you. What drives them to such self-sacrifice, as we\n> witnessed on Giedi Prime? If I can distill an explanation, your\n> Synchronized Worlds will no longer be vulnerable to unpredictable\n> attacks.\"\n>\n> The watcheye hovered as a million possibilities showered through the\n> abundant mind of Omnius. Presently, the computer made his decision.\n> \"You have my permission to proceed. But do not continue to test my\n> patience.\"\n>\n> *People require continuity.*\n\n--- BOVKO MANRESA,\n\nFirst Viceroy of the League of Nobles\n\n> **O**n Poritrin, the virulent fever raced through the mudflats and\n> docks where slaves made their dreary homes. Despite the best\n> quarantine and mitigation efforts, the disease killed a number of\n> officials and merchants, and even spread as far as the slaves in Tio\n> Holtzman's blufftop laboratories, where it caused quite a disruption\n> in the scientist's work.\n>\n> When Holtzman first noticed symptoms of the illness among his crowded\n> equation solvers, he immediately ordered removal of the sick ones to\n> isolation chambers and sealed off the remainder of the calculating\n> teams. The distracted Savant thought the slaves would rejoice at being\n> relieved of their mathematical chores; instead the solvers moaned and\n> prayed, asking why the hand of God would strike *them* rather than\n> their oppressors.\n>\n> Within two weeks, half of his household slaves had either died or been\n> quarantined. Such a shift in daily routines was not conducive to the\n> Savant's mental work.\n>\n> Several large-scale simulations had been under way, following the\n> gradual development of parameters established by the talented Norma\n> Cenva. Groaning at the inconvenience, Holtzman knew that stopping the\n> lengthy work in midstream would necessitate new teams to start over\n> again. To maintain his stature, he needed a major breakthrough soon.\n>\n> Lately his reputation had been supported more by Norma's work than his\n> own. Naturally, he had taken full credit for modifying the\n> scrambler-field generators into an offensive weapon. Lord Bludd had\n> delighted in presenting two prototypes to the Armada liberation force\n> for Giedi Prime. Indeed, the scrambler projectors had served the\n> rescuers well, but the prototypes had consumed enough energy to ground\n> two troop transports, and the devices themselves had broken down---\n> irreparably--- after only one\n>\n> use. In addition, the disruptive pulse had yielded uneven results,\n> since many robots had been shielded by walls or unaffected by the\n> dissipating field. Still, the idea showed promise, and the nobles\n> urged Holtzman to work on improvements, without ever knowing about\n> Norma's involvement.\n>\n> At least Holtzman's reputation was secure again. For a while.\n>\n> Norma was quiet but diligent. Rarely interested in diversions or\n> amusements, she worked hard and scrutinized her own ideas. Despite\n> Holtzman's wishes, she insisted on performing most calculations\n> personally rather than handing them off to solver teams. Norma was too\n> independent to understand the economics of delegating tasks. Her\n> dedication made her a rather dull person.\n>\n> After rescuing the young prodigy from her obscurity on Rossak, he had\n> hoped, unrealistically perhaps, that Norma might provide him with\n> sudden inspiration. During a recent cocktail party in Lord Bludd's\n> conical towers, the nobleman had made a joke about Holtzman taking a\n> holiday from his usual brilliance. Though the comment had stung, the\n> inventor had laughed along with the other tittering nobles. Still, it\n> high-lighted--- in his own mind, at least--- that he had not created\n> anything really original in some time.\n>\n> Following a restless night of bizarre dreams, Holtzman finally came up\n> with a concept to explore. Expanding some of the electromagnetic\n> features he had used for his scrambler fields, he might be able to\n> create an \"alloy resonance generator.\" Properly tuned, a thermal-field\n> inducer would couple with metals--- the bodies of robots, for\n> instance, or even the crablike warrior-forms worn by cymeks. Given the\n> correct adjustment, the resonance generator could slam selected metal\n> atoms against each other, generating enormous heat until the machine\n> shook itself apart.\n>\n> The concept seemed promising. Holtzman intended to pursue its\n> development with full enthusiasm and haste.\n>\n> But first he needed more solvers and assistants to construct the\n> prototype. And now he had to waste a day on the mundane task of\n> replacing the\n>\n> household slaves that had died from the fever. With a frustrated sigh,\n> he left his laboratories and trudged down the zigzag trail to the base\n> of the bluffs, where he caught a jetboat across the river.\n>\n> On the opposite shore, at the widest part of the delta, he visited a\n> bustling river market. Rafts and barges had been lashed together for\n> so long that they might well have been part of the landscape. The\n> merchants'quarter was not far from the Starda spaceport, where vendors\n> provided offworld oddities: drugs from Rossak, interesting woods and\n> plants from Ecaz, gems from Hagal, musical instruments from Chusuk.\n>\n> In shops that fronted a narrow alley, tailors were copying the latest\n> Salusan fashions, cutting and sewing exotic imported cloths and fine\n> Poritrin linens. Holtzman had used many of these garment makers to\n> enhance his personal wardrobe. An eminent Savant such as himself could\n> not spend all of his time in the laboratories. After all, he was\n> frequently called upon to make public appearances to answer questions\n> from citizens and often spoke before committees of nobles, to convince\n> them of his continued importance.\n>\n> But today Holtzman made his way farther out onto the floating rafts\n> and barges. He needed to purchase people, not clothes. The scientist\n> saw a sign on the dock ahead, in Galach:HUMAN RESOURCES. He crossed\n> creaking boardwalks and gangplanks to a cluster of rafts that held\n> captives. Grouped in lots behind barricades, the sullen prisoners were\n> dressed in drab, identical uniforms, many of which fit badly. The\n> slaves were lean and angular, as if unaccustomed to eating regular\n> meals. These men and women came from planets that few of the free\n> citizens of Poritrin had ever heard of, much less visited.\n>\n> Their handlers seemed aloof, not particularly eager to show off wares\n> or haggle over prices. After the recent plague, many households and\n> estates needed to replace their personnel, and it was a\n> sellers'market.\n>\n> Other customers crowded against the railings, scrutinizing the\n> downcast faces, inspecting the merchandise. One old man clutching a\n> wad of credits\n>\n> summoned the tender and asked for a closer look at four middle-aged\n> females.\n>\n> Holtzman was not particularly picky, nor did he want to waste time.\n>\n> Since he needed so many slaves, he intended to buy an entire lot. Once\n> they arrived at his blufftop estate, he would choose the most\n> intelligent ones to work calculations, while the remainder would cook,\n> clean, or maintain his household.\n>\n> He hated these menial shopping duties, but had never delegated them in\n> the past. He smiled, realizing he had been critical of Norma for doing\n> the very same thing, for her failure to use solvers.\n>\n> Impatient and eager, Holtzman summoned the nearest handler, waving\n> Niko Bludd's credit authorization and pushing himself to the front. \"I\n> want a large order of slaves.\"\n>\n> The Human Resources merchant bustled over, grinning and bowing. \"Of\n> course, Savant Holtzman! What you require, I shall provide. Simply\n> specify your needs, and I will provide a competitive quotation.\"\n>\n> Suspicious that the merchant might try to cheat him, he said, \"I need\n> slaves that are smart and independent, but capable of following\n> instructions. Seventy or eighty will do, I suppose.\" Some of the\n> customers pushing close to the railing grumbled, but did not challenge\n> the celebrity inventor.\n>\n> \"Quite a demand,\" the vendor said, \"especially in these lean times.\n> The plague has created a shortage, until the Tlulaxa flesh merchants\n> deliver more.\"\n>\n> \"Everyone knows how important--- and *essential*--- my work is,\"\n> Holtzman said, pointedly removing a chronometer from the wide sleeve\n> of his white robe. \"My needs take precedence over some rich citizen\n> looking to replace a house cleaner. If you like, I will obtain a\n> special dispensation from Lord Bludd.\"\n>\n> \"I know you can do that, Savant,\" said the slave tender. He shouted at\n> the other customers pushing forward. \"All of you, quit your\n> complaining! Without this man, we'd be sweeping the floors for\n> thinking machines right now!\" Putting on another face, the handler\n> smiled back at Holtzman. \"The question, of course, is which slaves\n> would best serve you? I have a new batch just delivered from\n> Harmonthep: Zensunnis, all of them. Suitably docile, but I'm afraid\n> they go for a premium.\"\n>\n> Holtzman frowned. He preferred to use his finances in other ways,\n> especially considering the large investment that would be necessary\n> for his new alloy-resonator concept. \"Do not attempt to take advantage\n> of me, sir.\"\n>\n> The man reddened, but held his ground, sensing that the inventor was\n> in a hurry. \"Perhaps another group would be more suitable then? I have\n> some just in from IV Anbus.\" He gestured to a separate raft where\n> dark-haired slaves stared out with hostile expressions, challenging\n> the customers. \"They are Zenshiites.\"\n>\n> \"What's the difference? Are they less expensive?\"\n>\n> \"A simple matter of religious philosophy.\" The slave merchant waited\n> for some recognition, didn't see it, then smiled with relief. \"Who can\n> understand the Buddislamics, anyway? They're workers, and that's what\n> you need, right? I can sell you these Zenshiites for a lower price,\n> even though they're quite intelligent. Probably better educated than\n> the Harmonthep lot. They're healthy, too. I have medical\n> certifications. Not one of them has been exposed to the plague virus.\"\n>\n> Holtzman perused the group. They all had rolled up their left sleeves,\n> as if it were some kind of badge. Up front, a muscular man with fiery\n> eyes and a thick black beard gazed back at him dispassionately, as if\n> he considered himself superior to those who held him captive.\n>\n> With his cursory inspection, Holtzman could see nothing wrong with the\n> IV Anbus captives. His household was desperately understaffed, and his\n> laboratories needed more low-level technicians. Every day it was a\n> struggle\n>\n> to find enough solvers to work through the increasingly complex sets\n> of equations.\n>\n> \"But why are they cheaper?\" he persisted.\n>\n> \"They are more plentiful. It's a simple matter of supply and demand.\"\n> The slave vendor held his gaze. He named a price.\n>\n> Too impatient to haggle for the best deal, Holtzman nodded. \"I'll take\n> eighty of them.\" He raised his voice. \"I don't care if they're from IV\n> Anbus or Harmonthep. They're on Poritrin now, and they work for Savant\n> Tio Holtzman.\"\n>\n> The crafty slave merchant turned to the group of captives and shouted.\n> \"You hear that? You should be proud.\"\n>\n> The dark-haired captives simply looked back at their new master,\n> saying nothing. Holtzman was relieved. That probably meant they would\n> be more tractable.\n>\n> He transferred the correct amount of credits. \"See that they are\n> cleaned up and sent to my residence.\"\n>\n> The grinning slave handler thanked him profusely. \"Don't you worry,\n> Savant Holtzman. You'll be satisfied with this lot.\"\n>\n> As the great man left the crowded river market, other customers began\n> to shout and wave their credit vouchers, squabbling over the remaining\n> slaves. It promised to be a furious day of bidding.\n\n*Over the course of history, the stronger species invariably wins.*\n\n--- TLALOC,\n\n*A Time for Titans*\n\n> **A**fter taking refuge in the Arrakis wasteland, the Zensunni\n> Wanderers were little more than scavengers, and not very brave. Even\n> on their most distant excursions to collect useful items, the nomads\n> remained close to the rocks, avoiding the deep desert and the demon\n> worms.\n>\n> Long ago, after the Imperial chemist Shakkad the Wise had remarked on\n> the rejuvenating properties of the obscure spice melange, there had\n> been a small market for the natural substance among offworlders at the\n> Arrakis City spaceport. However, the planet's distance from popular\n> spacing lanes had never made melange an economically attractive item.\n> \"An oddity, not a commodity,\" one surly merchant had told Naib\n> Dhartha. Still, spice was a staple in the food supply, and it must be\n> gathered . . . but only on sands close to the rocks.\n>\n> Dhartha led a party of six across a ridge of packed powder sand that\n> held their footprints as if they were kisses in the dust. Loose white\n> cloths around their heads and faces exposed only their eyes; their\n> cloaks blew in the breeze, revealing equipment belts, tools, and\n> weapons. Dhartha snugged the cloth higher over his nose to keep from\n> breathing grit. He scratched the tattoo etched so painstakingly onto\n> his cheek, then narrowed his eyes, always alert for danger.\n>\n> No one thought to watch the clear morning skies until they heard a\n> faint whistle growing quickly into a howl. To Naib Dhartha, it sounded\n> like a woman who had just learned of her husband's death.\n>\n> Looking up, he saw a silvery bullet that tore through the atmosphere,\n> then recognized the unexpected hum and whine of thrusters. A\n> bubble-shaped object plummeted through the sky, spun about and\n> see-sawed in the open air as if choosing a place to land. Quad engines\n> slowed its descent. Then, less\n>\n> than a kilometer from where the scavenging party stood, the object\n> slammed into the dunes like a fist thumping into the stomach of a\n> dishonest merchant. A spray of dust and sand shot upward, embracing a\n> tendril of dark soot.\n>\n> The Naib stood stiffly and stared, while his men began to jabber\n> excitedly. Young Ebrahim was as enthralled as Dhartha's own son,\n> Mahmad; both boys wanted to race out and investigate.\n>\n> Mahmad was a good lad, respectful and cautious. But Dhartha had a low\n> opinion of Ebrahim, who liked to tell stories and talk of imaginary\n> exploits. Then there was the incident in which tribal water had been\n> stolen, an unforgivable crime. Initially the Naib had thought two boys\n> were involved, Ebrahim and Selim. But Ebrahim had been quick to\n> disavow any responsibility and to point the finger at the other boy.\n> Selim had seemed shocked at the accusation, but had not denied it.\n>\n> In addition, Ebrahim's father had stepped forward to make a generous\n> deal with Dhartha to save his son . . . and so the orphan boy had\n> received the ultimate sentence of banishment. Not much of a loss to\n> the tribe. A Naib often had to make such difficult decisions.\n>\n> Now, as the scavengers looked at Dhartha, their bright eyes glinting\n> between folds of dirty white cloth, he knew he could not ignore the\n> opportunity of this crashed ship, whatever it was. \"We must go see\n> this thing,\" he called.\n>\n> His men rushed across the sands, boisterous Ebrahim and Mahmad in the\n> lead, hurrying toward the pillar of dust that marked the impact.\n> Dhartha did not like to stray far from the sheltering rock, but the\n> desert beckoned them toward a rich, alien treasure.\n>\n> The nomads crested one dune, slid down the slipface, and scurried up\n> another. By the time they reached the impact crater, they were all\n> winded, panting hot breaths that were smothered by the cloths over\n> their mouths. The Naib and his men stood on the high lip of excavated\n> sand. Glassy smears of superheated silica had splattered like saliva\n> on the ground.\n>\n> Inside the pit lay a mechanical object the size of two men, with\n> protrusions and components that hummed and moved, awakening now that\n> it had landed. The carbon fiber-encased body still smoked from the\n> heat of reentry. A spacecraft, perhaps?\n>\n> One of Dhartha's men stepped back, making a warding sign with his\n> fingers. Overzealous Ebrahim, though, bent forward. The Naib put a\n> hand on Mahmad's left arm, cautioning his son. Let the foolish one\n> take the risks.\n>\n> The crashed pod was too small to carry passengers. The lights blinked\n> brighter, and the probe's sides opened like dragon wings to expose\n> mechanical limbs, articulated claws, and complex machinery inside.\n> Scanners, processors, engines of investigation and destruction.\n> Mirrorlike power converters spread out in the glare of the sun.\n>\n> Ebrahim slid down the churned sand at the edge of the pit. \"Imagine\n> what this would be worth at the spaceport, Naib! If I get to it first,\n> I should receive the largest salvage share.\"\n>\n> Dhartha wanted to argue with the exuberant youth, but when he saw that\n> no one--- except for his own son--- looked eager to join Ebrahim, he\n> nodded. \"If successful, you'll get an extra share.\" Even if the\n> falling object was completely ruined, the nomads could work the pure\n> metal for their own purposes.\n>\n> The brash young man stopped halfway down the loose slope, looking\n> suspiciously at the device, which continued to vibrate and thump.\n> Flexible components extruded arms and legs, while strange lenses and\n> mirrors rotated at the ends of flexible carbon fiber tentacles. The\n> probe seemed to be assessing its surroundings, as if it didn't\n> comprehend where it had landed.\n>\n> The machine paid no attention to the surreptitious humans, until\n> Ebrahim dug a stone from the slumping side of the crater. He called\n> out \"Ai! Ai!\" then hurled the rock. It struck the composite material\n> of the probe's side with an echoing *clunk*.\n>\n> The mechanical lander froze, then turned its lenses and scanners\n> toward the human standing all alone. Ebrahim hunched on bent knees in\n> the yielding sand.\n>\n> Blinding hot light erupted from one of the lenses. A gout of coherent\n> fire engulfed Ebrahim and blew him backward in a crackling cloud of\n> incinerated flesh and bones. A wad of smoldering garments struck the\n> top of the crater, along with charred pieces of his hands and feet.\n>\n> Mahmad screamed for his friend, and Dhartha immediately yelled for the\n> men to retreat. They stumbled back down the outside of the crater and\n> fled through the soft gully between dunes. Half a kilometer away,\n> safe, they climbed to a sandy crest high enough that they could look\n> back toward the pit. The men prayed and made superstitious gestures,\n> and Dhartha raised his clenched right fist. Foolish Ebrahim had drawn\n> the attention of the mechanical thing and had paid with his life.\n>\n> From a distance, the would-be scavengers watched. The crashed probe\n> paid them no further heed. Instead, with thumping and clattering, the\n> machine seemed to be assembling itself, building structures around its\n> core. Scooping hands drew sand into a resource-production hopper in\n> its belly and extruded glasslike rods that it used for structural\n> supports. The machine added new components, building itself larger,\n> and finally began digging its way out of the pit. It pounded and\n> hammered, making a great deal of racket.\n>\n> Dhartha remained perplexed. Though he was a leader, he had no idea\n> what to do. Such a thing was beyond his ken. Perhaps someone at the\n> spaceport would know, but he hated to rely on outworlders. Besides,\n> this thing might be valuable, and he didn't want to surrender his\n> salvage.\n>\n> \"Father, look.\" Mahmad gestured toward the wasteland of sand. \"See,\n> that machine demon will pay for killing my friend.\"\n>\n> Dhartha saw the telltale ripple, the stirring of a behemoth beneath\n> the sands. The crashed probe continued its pounding, rhythmic motion\n> with a clattering of components, oblivious to its surroundings. The\n> assembled mechanism raised itself, a monstrous composite of\n> crystalline materials and\n>\n> silica struts reinforced by carbon-fiber beams converted from its own\n> hull and support girders.\n>\n> The sandworm came in fast, tunneling just beneath the surface until\n> its head rose up. The mouth was a huge shovel larger than the impact\n> crater.\n>\n> The robotic probe waved its sensor arms and weapons lenses, sensing it\n> was being attacked, but not understanding how. Several white-hot\n> blasts of fire penetrated the loose ground.\n>\n> The worm swallowed the mechanical demon whole. Then the sinuous desert\n> creature burrowed beneath the dust again like a sea serpent seeking\n> deeper waters. . . .\n>\n> Naib Dhartha and his men remained petrified on the dunes. If they\n> turned and ran now, their vibrations would call the sandworm back for\n> another meal.\n>\n> Soon enough, they saw the worm trail heading outward, returning to the\n> deep desert. The crater was gone, along with all evidence of the\n> mechanical construction. Not even a scrap of foolish Ebrahim's body\n> remained.\n>\n> Shaking his head with its long black ponytail, Dhartha turned to his\n> shocked companions. \"This will make a legendary story, a magnificent\n> ballad to be sung in our caves in the dark of night. . . .\" He drew a\n> deepbreath and turned around. \"Though I doubt anyone will ever believe\n> us.\"\n>\n> *The future? I hate it because I will not be there.*\n\n--- JUNO,\n\n*Lives of the Titans*\n\n> **A**fter the unexpected encounter with the League Armada at Giedi\n> Prime, the battered *Dream Voyager* took an extra month to limp back\n> to Earth for repairs. Because of the slow pace caused by the damage,\n> Seurat had immediately dispatched his emergency buoy, relaying to\n> Omnius the dire news of the fall of the newest Synchronized World and\n> the loss of the Titan Barbarossa. By now the evermind must know what\n> had happened.\n>\n> The robot captain did his best to repair or bypass the ship's damaged\n> systems and seal off sections to protect his fragile human copilot.\n> General Agamemnon would not be pleased if his biological son were\n> injured. Besides, Seurat had developed a certain fondness for Vorian\n> Atreides. . . .\n>\n> Vor insisted on donning an environment suit and crawling outside the\n> update ship to inspect the hull. Seurat tethered him with two lines,\n> while three inspector drones accompanied him. When the young man saw\n> the blackened wound where the rebellious humans had fired upon them,\n> he once again felt a sense of shame. Intent only on delivering the\n> vital Omnius updates, Seurat had committed no aggressive act against\n> these *hrethgir*, yet they had attacked him. Wild humans were without\n> honor.\n>\n> Agamemnon and his friend Barbarossa had brought the unruly populace of\n> Giedi Prime into the sweeping embrace of Omnius, yet the *hrethgir*\n> had spurned the greater civilization of the Synchronized Worlds,\n> making a martyr of Barbarossa in the process. His father would be\n> deeply disturbed at the loss of such a close friend, one of the last\n> remaining Titans.\n>\n> Vor himself could have been killed, his soft and breakable human form\n> destroyed without ever having the chance to become a neo-cymek. A\n> single blow from the Armada could have erased all of Vor's potential,\n> all of his future work. He could not update himself or back up his\n> memories and\n>\n> experiences, as a machine could. He'd be lost, just like the Giedi\n> Prime-- Omnius. Just like the other twelve sons of Agamemnon. The\n> thought sickened him, and he shuddered.\n>\n> On their return journey, Seurat tried to cheer Vor with ridiculous\n> jokes, as if nothing had happened. The robot commended his companion\n> for quick thinking and tactical innovation in outwitting the\n> *hrethgir* officer. Vor's deceit in pretending to be a rebellious\n> human who had captured a thinking-machine vessel--- what an outr\u00e9\n> scenario!--- had given them a few moments of valuable time, and his\n> decoy projections had allowed them to escape. Perhaps it would even be\n> taught to others in the trustee schools on Earth.\n>\n> Vor, however, cared most about what his father might say. The approval\n> of the great Agamemnon would make everything all right.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WHEN THE *DREAM VOYAGER* landed at Earth's central spaceport, Vorian\n> hurried down the ramp, eyes alert, face eager--- then crestfallen when\n> he saw no sign of the Titan general.\n>\n> Vor swallowed hard. Unless vital matters intervened, his father always\n> came to greet him. These were rare moments they had together, when\n> they could exchange ideas, talk about plans and dreams. Vor comforted\n> himself with the thought that Agamemnon probably had important\n> business for Omnius.\n>\n> Robotic maintenance crews and repair machinery trundled forward to\n> inspect the damaged ship. One of the multicomponent machines paused in\n> its assessment, broke away, and hummed toward him. \"Vorian Atreides,\n> Agamemnon has commanded you to meet him in the conditioning facility.\n> Report there immediately.\"\n>\n> The young human brightened. Letting the robot return to its work, he\n> walked off briskly. When he could contain himself no longer, he began\n> to run. . . .\n>\n> Though he attempted to exercise during the long voyages with Seurat,\n> Vor's biological muscles were weaker than a machine's, and he tired\n> quickly. Another reminder of his mortality, his fragility, and the\n> inferiority of natural biology. It only increased his desire to wear a\n> powerful neo-cymek body someday and discard this imperfect human form.\n>\n> His lungs burning, Vor rushed into the gleaming chrome-and-plaz\n> chamber where his father's brain canister was regularly polished and\n> recharged with electrafluid. As soon as the young man entered the\n> cold, well-lit room, two robot guards folded in behind him, ominously\n> blocking egress. In the center of the chamber stood a mechanical,\n> human-shaped colossus that Agamemnon now wore. The behemoth took two\n> steps forward, stabilizer-feet hammering against the hard floor. He\n> dwarfed his son, towering three times Vorian's height.\n>\n> \"I have been waiting for you, my son. Everything is prepared. What\n> caused your delay?\"\n>\n> Intimidated, Vor looked up at the preservation canister. \"I hurried\n> here, Father. My ship landed only an hour ago.\"\n>\n> \"I understand the *Dream Voyager* was damaged at Giedi Prime, attacked\n> by the human rebels that murdered Barbarossa and recaptured the\n> world.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, sir.\" Vor knew better than to waste the Titan's time with\n> unnecessary details. The general would already have received a full\n> report. \"I will answer any questions you might have, Father.\"\n>\n> \"I have no questions, only *commands*.\" Instead of instructing his son\n> to begin the process of grooming and polishing his components,\n> Agamemnon raised a gauntleted hand, clutched Vorian by the chest, and\n> pushed him forcefully against an upright table.\n>\n> Vor was slammed against the smooth surface and felt a burst of pain.\n> His father was so powerful that he could accidentally break bones,\n> sever the spine. \"What is it, Father? What---\"\n>\n> Holding him immobile, Agamemnon clamped on wrist bindings, a waist\n> restraint, and ankle cuffs. Helpless now, Vor twisted his head to look\n> at what his father was doing and saw that complex devices had been\n> brought into the chamber. With trepidation he noted hollow cylinders\n> filled with bluish fluids, neuromechanical pumps, and chittering\n> machines that waved questing sensor tips in the air.\n>\n> \"Please, Father.\" Vor's deepest fears careened through his mind,\n> ricocheting off the pain, each impact increasing his doubts and\n> terrors. \"What have I done wrong?\"\n>\n> Showing no readable expression on his head turret, Agamemnon extended\n> an array of long needles toward his son's squirming body. The steel\n> points penetrated his chest, poking between his ribs, seeking out and\n> finding his lungs, his heart. Two silver shafts pierced his throat.\n> Blood oozed out everywhere. Vor's neck sinews bulged as he clenched\n> his jaw and curled back his lips, biting back a scream.\n>\n> But the scream broke through anyway.\n>\n> The cymek manipulated the machinery connected to Vorian's body,\n> increasing the pain beyond all imaginable levels. Convinced that he\n> had failed somehow, Vor assumed it was his time to die--- like the\n> twelve unknown brothers who had preceded him. Now, it seemed, Vorian\n> had not lived up to Agamemnon's expectations.\n>\n> Agony swelled higher, with no crest in sight. His scream became a\n> prolonged wail, as acid-colored fluids were pumped into his body. Soon\n> even his vocal cords gave out, and his shriek continued only in his\n> mind . . .\n>\n> yet it continued nevertheless. He could endure no more. He could not\n> imagine the grievous injury his stretched and torn body must already\n> have endured.\n>\n> When finally the torture concluded and Vor came back to himself, he\n> didn't know how long he had been unconscious--- perhaps even lost in\n> the cloak of death. His body felt as if it had been crushed into a\n> ball and then stretched back into the form of a man.\n>\n> The colossus shape of Agamemnon loomed over him, a galaxy of optic\n> threads glittering on his body. Even though the remnants of\n> excruciating pain echoed inside his skull, Vor resisted crying out.\n> His father had kept him alive after all, for his own reasons. He\n> stared into the Titan's implacable metal face and could only hope that\n> his father had not revived him just to inflict more agony.\n>\n> *What have I done wrong?*\n>\n> Yet the ancient cymek did not have murder on his mind. Instead he\n> said, \"I am exceedingly pleased with your actions aboard the *Dream\n> Voyager*, Vorian. I have analyzed Seurat's report and determined that\n> your tactical prowess in escaping from the League Armada was\n> innovative and unexpected.\"\n>\n> Vorian couldn't understand the context of his father's words. They\n> seemed unrelated to the tortures the general had inflicted on him.\n>\n> \"No thinking machine would have considered such a deceitful trick. I\n> doubt even another trustee would have been so quick to think of the\n> ruse. In fact, Omnius's summation concludes that any other action\n> would likely have resulted in the capture or destruction of the *Dream\n> Voyager*. Seurat would never have been capable of surviving by\n> himself. You not only saved the ship, you saved the Omnius update\n> spheres and returned them intact.\" Agamemnon paused, then reiterated.\n> \"Yes, I am exceedingly pleased, my son. You have the potential of\n> becoming a great cymek someday.\"\n>\n> Vor's raw throat convulsed as he tried to force out words. The\n> needle-studded cradle had been yanked away, and now Agamemnon released\n> the body restraints that held him against the hard surface. Vorian's\n> watery muscles could not support him, and he drooped like a rag,\n> sliding down until he pooled on his knees on the floor. Finally he\n> choked, \"Then why was I tortured? Why have you punished me?\"\n>\n> Agamemnon simulated a laugh. \"When I choose to punish you, son, you\n> will know. That was a *reward*. Omnius allowed me to grant you this\n> rare\n>\n> gift. In fact, no other human in all the Synchronized Worlds has been\n> so honored.\"\n>\n> \"But how, Father? Please explain it to me. My mind is still\n> throbbing.\" His voice hitched.\n>\n> \"What are a few moments of pain, in comparison with the gift you have\n> received?\" The colossus paced back and forth across the sparkling\n> maintenance room, shaking the floor and the walls. \"Unfortunately, I\n> was unable to convince Omnius to convert you into a neo-cymek--- you\n> are too young--- but I am sure the time will come. I wanted you to\n> serve at my side\n>\n> --- more than a trustee, but as my true successor.\" His sparkling\n> optic threads glowed brighter. \"Instead, I have done the next best\n> thing for you.\"\n>\n> The cymek general explained that he had given Vorian a rigorous\n> biotech treatment, a cellular replacement system that would\n> dramatically extend his life as a human. \"Geriatric specialists\n> developed the technique in the Old Empire . . . though to what purpose\n> I cannot fathom. Those oafs did nothing productive during their normal\n> lifespans, so why should they want to live for centuries longer and\n> accomplish even less? Through new proteins, rejection of free\n> radicals, more efficient cellular repair mechanisms, they prolonged\n> their pointless existences.

You have time to experience many things, important\n> things.\"\n>\n> The hulking cymek stalked over to a harness and used an intricate\n> network of artificial hands and clamps extruded from the metal wall to\n> link to the thoughtrodes of his brain canister. Flexible lifting arms\n> raised the cylinder out of the colossus body core and shuttled it over\n> to one of the chrome pedestals.\n>\n> \"Now you are one step closer to your potential, Vorian,\" Agamemnon\n> said through a wall speaker, detached from the mobile body.\n>\n> Though weak and still in pain, Vor knew what his father expected of\n> him now. He hurried to the conditioning devices and with trembling\n> hands attached power cables to the magsockets of the translucent brain\n> chamber. The bluish electrafluid seemed full of mental energy.\n>\n> Trying to restore a sense of normalcy amid the clamoring disbelief at\n> what had just happened to him, Vor went through his habitual grooming\n> duties, tending his father's mechanical systems. Lovingly, the young\n> man gazed at the wrinkled mass of brain, the ancient mind so full of\n> profound ideas and difficult decisions, as expressed in the general's\n> extensive memoirs. Each time he read them, Vor hoped to understand his\n> complex father better.\n>\n> He wondered if Agamemnon had kept him in the dark to play a cruel joke\n> on him, or to challenge his resolve. Vor would always accept whatever\n> the cymek general commanded, would never try to flee. Now that the\n> agony was over, he hoped he had passed whatever test his father had\n> administered.\n>\n> As Vor continued the patient grooming of the preservation tank,\n> Agamemnon spoke softly, a susurration. \"You are very quiet, my son.\n> What do you think about the great gift you have received?\"\n>\n> The young man paused a moment, not certain how to respond. Agamemnon\n> was often impulsive and difficult to understand, but he rarely acted\n> without a larger purpose in mind. Vor could only hope to comprehend\n> the overall picture someday, the grand tapestry.\n>\n> \"Thank you, Father,\" he finally said, \"for giving me more time to\n> accomplish everything you want me to do.\"\n>\n> *Why do humans spend so much time worrying about what they call \"moral\n> issues\"?

Why don't we erect it anyway, to show\n> the universe that we can brush aside minor annoyances like this\n> accident? My workers can perform all the necessary repairs in place.\"\n> Iblis's eyes shone with artificial enthusiasm. \"There is no reason for\n> further delay.\"\n>\n> Pacing about the carnage and confusion in his menacing armored body,\n> Ajax stomped on one of the crew leaders who was babbling his\n> innocence, pulping him into the ground. Then the angry Titan towered\n> over Iblis, optic threads glowing like white-hot stars. \"You have now\n> accepted responsibility to see that work continues according to\n> schedule. If your teams fail, the blame will be yours.\"\n>\n> \"Of course, Lord Ajax.\" Iblis showed no alarm at all. He could\n> convince the slaves to carry the burden. They would do it for him.\n>\n> \"Then get this mess cleaned up!\" Ajax thundered in a voice that could\n> be heard across the hilltop Forum.\n>\n> Later, Iblis made promises to his already-exhausted, overtaxed slaves.\n> They had been discontented and resistant for a while, but he won them\n> over with a stirring account of the wondrous benefits they would\n> receive: the finest sex slaves, incredible feasts, days of leisure to\n> journey about the countryside. \"I am not like other trustees. Have I\n> ever let you down? Ever promised a reward that I failed to deliver?\"\n>\n> With such an incentive, not to mention a healthy dose of fear for the\n> Titan Ajax, the laborers set to the task with redoubled energy. In the\n> coolness of the evening, with hovering spotlights glaring like\n> super-novas over the construction site, Iblis kept his crew working\n> efficiently. From his high wooden platform, he watched as the slaves\n> raised the immense statue on its sturdy reinforced pedestal and\n> plasma-bolted it into place.\n>\n> Artisans rushed forward and scaled the curved stone-and-iron surface\n> with climbing equipment, and set up swaying temporary scaffolds to\n> begin their restoration work. Ajax's legendary face had a marred nose\n> and one dented muscular arm, as well as deep gouges across the front\n> of the Titan uniform. In his secret heart, Iblis suspected the real\n> Ajax's human form had been lumpish and ugly.\n>\n> Throughout the long, tiresome night, Iblis struggled to stay awake,\n> leaning against the rail and peering into the blurring abyss. He dozed\n> off, then awoke, startled, as he heard the smooth hum of the lift\n> platform rising to his level.\n>\n> But he was mystified to see that the lift bore no one at all. Only a\n> small sheet of rolled-up metal, a message cylinder. Iblis stared, his\n> heart pounding, but the lift remained at his level, as if waiting. He\n> looked over the edge, but could not determine who had left the\n> message.\n>\n> *How could he ignore it?*\n>\n> Iblis stole forward and grabbed the scrap of scribed metal. He broke\n> the seal, unrolled the thin sheet, and read with increasing\n> astonishment.\n>\n> \"We represent an organized movement of dissatisfied humans. We are\n> waiting for the right moment and the right leader to begin an open\n> revolt against the oppressive machines. You must determine if you wish\n> to join our worthy cause. We will contact you again.\"\n>\n> As Iblis stared in disbelief at the unsigned message, the lettering\n> faded and disappeared, corroding into blobs of rust that ate through\n> the metal itself and flaked away.\n>\n> Was it authentic, or some sort of a cymek trap designed to lure him?\n> Most humans hated their machine masters, but took pains to conceal it.\n> *What if there really is such a group?* And if so, they would need\n> talented leaders.\n>\n> The thought exhilarated him. Iblis had never considered such an idea\n> before, and he couldn't imagine what he had said or done to reveal his\n> innermost thoughts and feelings. Why did they suspect? He had always\n> been respectful to his superiors, had always---\n>\n> *But have I been overly attentive? Have I tried too hard to appear\n> loyal?*\n>\n> On the towering Ajax statue, just below his own level, the artisans\n> remained hard at work like busy termites on a log. They repaired\n> scrape marks, expertly patched and painted the marred exterior. Dawn\n> broke across the monumental statue, and Iblis could see they would be\n> finished soon. The machines would reward him for his labors.\n>\n> How he hated them!\n>\n> Iblis wrestled with his conscience. The thinking machines had treated\n> him well in comparison with other slaves, but only a thin layer of\n> protection kept him from the same fate. In his private moments Iblis\n> often pondered the value of freedom, and what he could do if given the\n> chance.\n>\n> A rebel group? He could barely believe it. As days went by, Iblis\n> found himself thinking about it more and more . . . and waiting to be\n> contacted again.\n\n> *Our appetite encompasses everything.*\n\n--- COGITOR EKLO,\n\n*Beyond the Human Mind*\n\n> **W**ith all the hatred concealed inside his mind, Agamemnon took\n> special precautions wherever Omnius could spy on him.

Or at least what passed for sex among the Titans.\n>\n> For their tryst, walker bodies brought the two ancient cymeks into a\n> maintenance chamber within the control pavilion on Earth. Around them,\n> tubes of nutrient liquids snaked toward storage tanks in the ceiling.\n> Robotic tenders moved from life-support generators to analysis banks,\n> skimming data from thoughtrodes, ensuring that all systems remained\n> within normal parameters.\n>\n> Agamemnon and Juno conversed with each other on a private short-range\n> band, twitching their respective sensors and sparking each other's\n> thoughtrodes through the electrafluid. *Foreplay*. Even without\n> physical bodies, the cymek minds could still experience intense\n> pleasure.\n>\n> Automated lifters disengaged his preservation canister smoothly from\n> its walking body, then set the thinking core on a clean chrome\n> pedestal beside the container that held Juno's pinkish gray brain.\n> With the accessible optic threads and computer comparison grids, he\n> recognized the distinctive folds and lobes of his lover's mind. *Still\n> beautiful after all these centuries*.\n>\n> Agamemnon remembered how lovely she had been back in the beginning:\n> obsidian-black hair that shimmered with blue highlights. Her nose had\n> been pointed, her face narrow, with eyebrows that arched in a\n> mysterious way. He always thought of her as Cleopatra, another\n> military genius from the mists of history, just like the first\n> Agamemnon in the Trojan War.\n>\n> Long ago, during the eyeblink of time when he had worn a frail human\n> physique, Agamemnon had fallen in love with this woman. Though Juno\n> was extremely desirable sexually, he had been attracted to her mind\n> before ever meeting her in person. He had first become aware of her on\n> a complex virtual network through tactical simulations and wargames he\n> had fought with her on the Old Empire's docile computers. The two of\n> them had been teenagers then, back when age mattered.\n>\n> As a boy, Agamemnon had been raised on pampered Earth, with the name\n> of Andrew Skouros. His parents had led a hedonistic but passionless\n> lifestyle, as had so many other citizens. They existed, they dabbled .\n> . . but none of them really *lived*. Across the depths of time, he\n> barely remembered the faces of his parents. All weak and feeble humans\n> looked the same to him now.\n>\n> Andrew Skouros had always been restless. He had asked uncomfortable\n> questions that no one could answer. While the others played frivolous\n> parlor games, the young man dug into archival databases, where he\n> uncovered history and legends. He found heroic tales of real people\n> who had existed so long ago they seemed as mythical as the race of\n> Titans, the earliest gods overthrown by Zeus and a pantheon of Greek\n> deities. He analyzed military conquests and came to understand tactics\n> at a time when it was an obsolete skill in the peace-strangled Empire.\n>\n> Under the alias \"Agamemnon,\" he became interested in strategic games\n> played across the computer network that monitored the activities of\n> ennui-enslaved humanity. There he had encountered another person as\n> skilled and talented as himself, a rare soulmate who shared his\n> restless interests. The mysterious player's wild and unexpected ideas\n> caused her campaigns to fail as often as they succeeded--- but her\n> surprising successes more than made up for the spectacular failures.\n> Her intriguing alias was \"Juno,\" taken from the queen of the Roman\n> gods, wife of Jupiter.\n>\n> Drawn together by their common ambition, their relationship was fiery\n> and challenging, more than just sex. They pleasured themselves by\n> developing\n>\n> thought-experiments. It was a game at first . . . and then much more\n> than that.\n>\n> Their lives changed dramatically when they had heard Tlaloc speak.\n>\n> The offworld visionary, with his disturbing, chastising accusations\n> against complacent humanity on Earth, made the two young schemers\n> realize that their plans could blossom into more than just imaginative\n> adventures.\n>\n> Juno, whose real name was Julianna Parhi, had brought the three of\n> them together. She and Andrew Skouros arranged to speak with Tlaloc,\n> who was excited to learn that they shared his dreams. \"We may be few,\"\n> Tlaloc had said, \"but in Earth's forests full of deadwood, three\n> matches may be enough to spark a conflagration.\"\n>\n> Meeting secretly, the rebellious trio plotted to overthrow the\n> sleeping Empire. Using Andrew's military expertise, they saw that a\n> small investment of hardware and manpower could take over many worlds\n> that had fallen into apathetic stupor. With a little luck and\n> acceptable tactics, like-minded leaders could form an iron grip around\n> the Old Empire. In fact, if the plans were properly set in motion, the\n> conquerors could achieve victory before anyone even noticed.\n>\n> \"It is for humanity's own good,\" Tlaloc had said, his eyes sparkling.\n> \"And for ours,\" Juno added. \"Just a little.\"\n>\n> In one of her innovative plans, Juno utilized the pervasive network of\n> thinking machines and their servile robots. The docile computers had\n> been given artificial intelligence to watch over every aspect of human\n> society, but Julianna saw them as an invasion army already in place .\n> . . if only they could be reprogrammed, given a taste for conquest and\n> human ambition. It was then that they had brought in a computer\n> specialist named Vilhelm Jayther--- who called himself Barbarossa on\n> computer networks--- to implement the technical details.\n>\n> Thus began the Time of Titans, during which a handful of enthusiastic\n> humans controlled the sleeping populace. They had work to do, an\n> empire to rule.\n>\n> During their planning stages, Julianna Parhi often queried a reluctant\n> Cogitor advisor, Eklo. While consulting the ancient Cogitor, one of\n> many spiritual minds who contemplated esoteric questions, she had seen\n> the possibilities of living as a disembodied brain. Not just for\n> introspection, but for action. She realized the advantages a *cymek*\n> tyrant would have over simple humans, able to switch mechanical bodies\n> as circumstances changed. As cymeks, the Titans could live and rule\n> for thousands of years.\n>\n> Perhaps that would be long enough.\n>\n> Agamemnon had immediately agreed with Juno's concept, though he faced\n> a primitive fear of the surgery itself. He and Juno knew that as the\n> Titans experienced the dangers of the universe and the fragility of\n> their human bodies, they would all come around.\n>\n> To show faith in his lover, Agamemnon was the first to undergo the\n> cymek process. He and Juno had spent a last heated night together,\n> naked and touching, storing memories of nerve sensations that would\n> have to last for millennia. Juno had tossed her raven hair, given him\n> a final, tender kiss, and led him into the surgical chamber. There,\n> computerized medical apparatus, robotic surgeons, and dozens of\n> life-support systems waited for him.\n>\n> The Cogitor Eklo had observed and assisted, offering advice whenever\n> necessary, providing precise instructions for the robotic surgeons.\n> Juno had watched her lover, eyes misty as she witnessed the\n> transformation process. Agamemnon feared that she would become\n> squeamish after that and renege on her own plans. But once his brain\n> hung suspended in dynamic electrafluid, once the thoughtrodes were\n> activated and he could \"see\" again through a galaxy of optic threads,\n> Juno was there admiring him, studying the brain canister.\n>\n> She had touched his transparent case with her fingertips. Agamemnon\n> watched it all, focusing and adjusting his new and unfamiliar sensors,\n>\n> enthralled with the ability to observe everything at once.\n>\n> A week later, when he felt competent enough with his new mechanical\n> systems, Agamemnon had returned the favor, watching over Juno as the\n> robotic surgeons sawed open her skull and removed her talented brain,\n> discarding forever the fallible female body of Julianna Parhi. . . .\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> CENTURIES LATER, EVEN without biological bodies, he and Juno remained\n> side by side on their chrome pedestals, connected by receptors and\n> stimulus patches.\n>\n> Agamemnon knew precisely which parts of Juno's brain to pulse in order\n> to activate pleasure centers, and how long to maintain the\n> stimulation. She responded in kind, bringing forth his stored memories\n> of human lovemaking and then amplifying the remembered sensations,\n> stunning him with new heights of euphoria. He struck back with a bolt\n> of his own, causing her brain to quiver.\n>\n> Through it all, the information-gathering watcheyes of Omnius observed\n> intently, like a mechanized voyeur. Even in a time such as this,\n> Agamemnon and Juno were never alone.\n>\n> She pleasured him twice more, making his mind throb; he wanted her to\n> stop so that he could rest, but also longed for her to continue.\n> Agamemnon reciprocated, causing a thin, vibrating sound to pulse from\n> the speakers attached to the canisters, an eerie warbling music that\n> symbolized their merging orgasms. He could barely think through the\n> haze of delight.\n>\n> But his brooding anger continued in the background. Though Omnius\n> allowed him and Juno to have their ecstasy as often as they wished,\n> Agamemnon would have derived even greater pleasure if they could\n> permanently escape the domination of the damned thinking machines.\n>\n> *I fear that Norma will never amount to anything. How does that\n> reflect on me and my own legacy to humanity?*\n>\n> --- ZUFA CENVA\n>\n> **D**uring the tedious month-long journey across space to visit her\n> daughter on Poritrin, Zufa Cenva had plenty of time to ponder what she\n> would say when she arrived. She would rather have been spending so\n> many days and weeks elsewhere on her more important work. The loss of\n> dear Heoma weighed like a hot stone inside her chest. Ever since the\n> first devastating attack against the cymeks on Giedi Prime, Zufa had\n> been planning further strikes with her other Sorceress weapons.\n>\n> While most members of the League gave credit to Savant Holtzman for\n> the portable scrambler projectors, she had heard whispers that Norma\n> herself may have inspired the design. Could her oddball daughter have\n> done something so remarkable? Not as great as a psychic storm\n> obliterating cymeks, but still respectable. *Perhaps I have been blind\n> after all.* Zufa had never wanted Norma to fail, but had given up hope\n> by now. Maybe things could change in their relationship. *Should I\n> embrace her? Does she deserve my support and encouragement, or will\n> she make me ashamed of her?*\n>\n> These were uncertain times.\n>\n> As Zufa stepped off the transport in Starda, she encountered a\n> delegation waiting to greet her, complete with ornately garbed Dragoon\n> guards, their gold-scale armor immaculate. Ruddy-faced Lord Niko Bludd\n> himself led the group, his beard intricately curled, his clothes\n> perfumed and colorful.\n>\n> \"Poritrin is honored by the visit of a Sorceress!\" The noble stepped\n> forward on the mosaic tile floor. Bludd wore a dashing ceremonial\n> costume with broad carmine lapels, frilly white cuffs, and golden\n> shoes. A ceremonial sword hung at his waist, though he had probably\n> never used a blade for anything more dangerous than cutting cheese.\n>\n> She'd never had any use for frippery when there was work to be done,\n> and Bludd's arrival surprised her. She had hoped to conclude her\n> business with Norma unobtrusively and then quickly return to Rossak.\n> She and her dedicated psychic warriors must prepare another mental\n> strike against the cymeks.\n>\n> \"The shuttle captain transmitted a message that you were coming,\n> Madame Cenva,\" Bludd said, as he guided her through the terminal. \"We\n> barely had time to put together a reception for you. You are here to\n> see your daughter, I presume?\" Niko Bludd grinned above his curled\n> reddish beard. \"We are very proud of how much she is helping Savant\n> Holtzman. He considers her quite indispensible.\"\n>\n> \"Indeed?\" Zufa tried to control her skeptical frown.\n>\n> \"We invited Norma to join us today, but she is deeply engrossed in\n> important work for Savant Holtzman. She seemed to think that you would\n> understand why she could not meet you herself.\"\n>\n> Zufa felt as if she had been slapped. \"I have been en route for a\n> month. If *I* can make the time, then a mere . . . lab assistant can\n> arrange to pick me up.\"\n>\n> Outside the spaceport, a chauffeur guided her to a lavish airbarge,\n> and the Dragoon guards took their places at the rails. \"We will\n> transport you directly to Holtzman's laboratories.\" When Bludd seated\n> himself beside her, she wrinkled her nose at his strong body perfumes.\n> He extended a small package to her, which she didn't want.\n>\n> With a sigh of exasperation, Zufa sat rigidly in the comfortable seat\n> as the aircraft proceeded away from the spaceport. Removing the\n> package's silver wrapping paper, Zufa found a bottle of river water\n> and an exquisitely woven Poritrin towel.\n>\n> Despite her lack of interest, the flamboyant noble insisted on\n> explaining. \"It is traditional for honored guests to wash their hands\n> in the water of the Isana and dry themselves on our fine linen.\"\n>\n> She made no move to use the gifts. Beneath the flying barge, water\n> vessels traveled downriver toward the sprawling delta city, where\n> grains, metals, and manufactured supplies were distributed to Poritrin\n> suppliers. In the brown mudflats, hundreds of slaves worked in the\n> muck to plant paddies of shellfish. The sight made her feel even more\n> unsettled than she already was.\n>\n> \"The residence of Savant Holtzman is just ahead,\" Bludd said, pointing\n> to a high bluff. \"I am sure your daughter will be pleased to see you.\"\n>\n> *Has she ever been pleased to see me?* Zufa wondered. She tried to\n> calm herself with mental exercises, but anxiety intruded.\n>\n> With a sweep of her long black dress, she stepped away from the\n> ostentatious airbarge as soon as it set down on Holtzman's landing\n> deck. \"Lord Bludd, I have private business to discuss with my\n> daughter. I'm sure you understand.\" Without further farewell, Zufa\n> marched alone up the broad patio steps to the mansion, leaving a\n> befuddled Bludd behind her. She waved her long arms, shooing him away.\n>\n> Her telepathic senses attuned, Zufa entered the dwelling as if she\n> belonged there. Holtzman's vestibule was cluttered with disarrayed\n> boxes, books, and instruments. Either the household staff did not do\n> their work, or the inventor had forbidden them to \"organize\" too much.\n>\n> Picking a path through the obstacles, Zufa strode into a long hallway,\n> then searched rooms and demanded information from anyone she met until\n> she found her daughter. Finally, the tall and intimidating Sorceress\n> entered an auxiliary laboratory building, where she saw a high stool\n> at an angled lightstrip table that held blueprint films. No sign of\n> Norma.\n>\n> She noticed an open door that led out to a balcony, then saw a shadow,\n> heard something move. Gliding to the balcony, Zufa was shocked to see\n> her daughter perched on top of the railing. Norma gripped a red plaz\n> container in her small hands.\n>\n> \"What are you doing?\" Zufa asked. \"Get down from there immediately!\"\n>\n> Startled, Norma glanced at her looming mother, then clasped the object\n> tightly and leaped off the railing out into the open air.\n>\n> \"No!\" Zufa shouted. But it was too late.\n>\n> Rushing to the edge, the Sorceress saw to her horror that the balcony\n> jutted out over a high bluff that dropped to the river, far below. The\n> small-statured young woman tumbled through the air, falling.\n>\n> Suddenly, Norma paused in midair and spun in a peculiar fashion. She\n> called, \"See for yourself, it works! You arrived just in time!\" Then,\n> like a feather on the wind, the girl drifted upward. The red device\n> lifted her back toward the balcony, like an invisible hand.\n>\n> Norma reached the level of the railing, and her angry mother yanked\n> her back onto the balcony. \"Why would you try something so dangerous?\n> Doesn't Savant Holtzman prefer you to employ helpers for this sort of\n> test?\"\n>\n> Norma frowned. \"They have *slaves* here, not helpers. Besides, it is\n> my own invention, and I wanted to do it myself. I knew it would work.\"\n>\n> Zufa did not want to argue. \"You came all the way to Poritrin and used\n> the League's best engineering laboratories to design some sort of . .\n> . flying toy?\"\n>\n> \"Hardly, Mother.\" Norma opened the lid of the red plaz unit and\n> adjusted electronics inside. \"It is a variation on Savant Holtzman's\n> theories, a repelling, or suspensor field. I expect him to be\n> delighted by it.\"\n>\n> \"Oh, I am, I am!\" The scientist appeared suddenly and stood behind\n> Zufa. He quickly introduced himself, then looked at Norma's new\n> gadget. \"I'll show it to Lord Bludd and see what he thinks of the\n> commercial possibilities. I'm sure he'll want a patent in his own\n> name.\"\n>\n> Zufa looked on, still recovering from the shock of Norma's \"fall,\"\n> trying to see practical applications of her daughter's invention.\n> Could such a thing be\n>\n> modified to carry troops or heavy objects? She doubted it.\n>\n> Norma set down the red-plaz generator and crossed the room with her\n> awkward, waddling gait. She climbed her high stool to reach the\n> blueprint films on the slanted light table, where she sifted through\n> pages. \"I've figured out how this principle can also be used on\n> illumination devices. The suspensor field can float lights and power\n> them with residual energy. I have all the calculations . . .\n> somewhere.\"\n>\n> \"Floating lights?\" Zufa said, in scornful tone. \"For what, a picnic?\n> Tens of thousands died in the cymek attack on Zimia, millions were\n> enslaved on Giedi Prime, and you live in secluded comfort--- making\n> floating *lights*?\"\n>\n> Norma gave her mother a condescending look, as if *Zufa* was the\n> foolish one. \"Think beyond the obvious, Mother. A war needs more than\n> just weapons. Robots can alter their optic sensors to see in the dark,\n> but humans must have light to see. Hundreds of these suspensor lights\n> could be dispersed in a nighttime combat zone, negating any advantage\n> the machines might have. Savant Holtzman and I think along those lines\n> every day.\"\n>\n> The scientist nodded, quick to concur with her. \"Or, for commercial\n> uses, they could be designed in a number of styles, even tuned to any\n> color or shade.\"\n>\n> Norma sat on her stool like a gnome perched on a throne. Her brown\n> eyes sparkled with excitement. \"I'm sure Lord Bludd will be most\n> pleased.\"\n>\n> Zufa frowned. There were more important issues at stake in this war\n> than pleasing a foppish nobleman. Impatient, she said, \"I came a great\n> distance to see you.\"\n>\n> Norma raised her eyebrows skeptically. \"If you had bothered to see me\n> *before* I departed from Rossak, Mother, you wouldn't have needed to\n> make such a long voyage to soothe your guilt. But you were too busy to\n> notice.\"\n>\n> Uneasy in the midst of a family argument, Tio Holtzman excused\n> himself.\n>\n> The combatants hardly noticed his departure.\n>\n> Zufa had not intended to pick a fight, but now she felt defensive. \"My\n> Sorceresses have proved their abilities in battle. We can exert\n> tremendous power with our minds to eradicate the cymeks. A number of\n> candidates are preparing themselves to offer the ultimate sacrifice if\n> we are called upon to free another machine-dominated world.\" Her pale\n> eyes flashed, and she shook her head. \"But you don't worry about that,\n> do you, Norma--- since you have no telepathic abilities.\"\n>\n> \"I have other skills, Mother. I am making a valuable contribution,\n> too.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, your incomprehensible equations.\" Zufa nodded toward the\n> suspensor field generator on the floor. \"Your life is not at stake.\n> Safe and pampered, you spend your days playing with these *toys*. You\n> have let yourself be blinded by imaginary success.\" But her daughter\n> wasn't the only one. Many people lived in comfort and security while\n> Zufa and her Sorceresses performed dangerous tasks. How could Norma\n> compare her work to *that*? \"When you heard I was coming, Norma, could\n> you not have found time to meet me at the spaceport?\"\n>\n> Norma's tone was deceptively mild as she crossed her arms over her\n> small chest. \"I did not ask you to come here, Mother, because I know\n> you have many important things to do. And *I* have more urgent duties\n> than ferrying unexpected guests around. Besides, I knew Lord Bludd was\n> going to meet you.\"\n>\n> \"Are League nobles your errand boys now?\" Now that she had opened the\n> floodgates of her anger, Zufa couldn't stop the words that came next.\n> \"I only wanted you to make me proud, Norma, despite your deformities.\n> But nothing you do will ever amount to anything. Living here in\n> luxury, what sacrifices do you make? Your vision is too small to be of\n> any real use to humanity.\"\n>\n> Previously, Norma would have crumbled under such an onslaught, her\n> confidence crushed. But her work here with Holtzman, her obvious\n> successes in the technical arena, had given her a new view of herself.\n> Now she looked coolly at her mother. \"Just because I don't fit the\n> image of what\n>\n> you wanted me to be doesn't mean I'm not contributing something\n> essential. Savant Holtzman sees it, and so does Aurelius. You're my\n> own mother--- why can't you?\"\n>\n> With a snort at the mention of Venport's name, Zufa began pacing.\n> \"Aurelius is just a man with hallucinations from the drugs he takes.\"\n>\n> \"I had forgotten how narrow-minded you truly are, Mother,\" Norma said\n> in a level tone. \"Thank you for coming all this way to refresh my\n> memory.\" The girl turned on her stool and resumed her plans and\n> equations. \"I am tempted to summon one of the slaves to escort you\n> out, but I wouldn't want to remove them from their more important\n> work.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> FURIOUS AT HERSELF and her daughter--- and at the wasted time--- Zufa\n> returned to the spaceport. She would stay on Poritrin no longer. To\n> get her mind off her concerns, she concentrated on mental exercises\n> and thought of how her beloved trainees in the jungles were ready to\n> give their utmost to their tasks, without personal considerations.\n>\n> Zufa waited a full day for a military transport that would take her\n> back to Rossak. As she surrounded herself with waves of her own\n> clairvoyant powers, she discovered a rotten weakness on Poritrin, and\n> it had nothing to do with Norma. It was so obvious, she could not\n> avoid it.\n>\n> All around Starda, at loading sites near the spaceport, at the\n> warehouses and mudflats, Zufa detected the individual and collective\n> auras of the downtrodden laborers. She sensed a collective\n> psychological wound, a deep and simmering discontent to which the free\n> Poritrin citizens seemed completely oblivious.\n>\n> The backwash of brooding resentment gave her one more reason to want\n> to get away from this place.\n>\n> *Intuition is a function by which humans see around corners.

Conversely, the thinking machine\n> was intrigued by her. She suspected that his interest was probably a\n> dangerous thing.\n>\n> He chose to wear fine clothes, loose robes and fluffy, ornate furs\n> that made his robot body look absurd.

On Salusa, she had never taken her family's\n> wealth for granted, feeling a need to earn the blessings bestowed upon\n> her.\n>\n> She asked, \"So, are you inquisitive, or inquisitor?\"\n>\n> \"Perhaps both.\" The robot leaned close to examine her, noting the\n> proud lift of her chin. \"I expect you to offer me many insights.\" He\n> touched her cheek with a cool, flexible finger. \"Lovely skin.\"\n>\n> She forced herself not to pull away. *Resistance must count for\n> something more than a captive's pride*, her mother had once told her.\n> If Serena struggled, Erasmus could hold her with his powerful robotic\n> grasp, or summon mechanized torturing devices. \"My skin is no more\n> lovely than yours,\" she said, \"except mine is not synthetic. My skin\n> was designed by nature, not by the mind of a machine.\"\n>\n> The robot chuckled, a tinny cachination. \"You see, I expect to learn\n> much from you.\" He led her into his lush greenhouses, which she\n> observed with reluctant delight.\n>\n> At the age of ten she had become fascinated with gardening, and had\n> delivered plants, herbs, and sweet exotic fruits to medical centers,\n> refugee complexes, and veteran homes, where she also volunteered her\n> services. Around Zimia, Serena had been renowned for her ability to\n> cultivate beautiful flowers. Under her loving attention, exquisite\n> little Immian roses bloomed, as did Poritrin hibiscus and even the\n> delicate morning violets of distant Kaitain.\n>\n> \"I will have you tend my prized plaza gardens,\" Erasmus said.\n>\n> \"Why can't machines perform such tasks? I'm sure they'd be much more\n> efficient--- or do you just revel in making your 'creators' do the\n> work?\"\n>\n> \"Do you not feel up to the task?\"\n>\n> \"I will do as you command--- for the sake of the plants.\" Pointedly\n> ignoring him, she touched a strangely shaped red and orange flower.\n> \"This looks like a bird of paradise, a pure strain from an ancient\n> stock. According to legend, these plants were favored by the sea kings\n> of Old Earth.\" With a look of defiance, Serena turned back to the\n> robot. \"There, now I have taught you something.\"\n>\n> Erasmus chuckled again, as if replaying a recording. \"Excellent. Now\n> tell me what you were truly thinking.\"\n>\n> She remembered words her father had spoken---*Fear invites aggression;\n> do not show it to a predator*--- and felt emboldened. \"While I was\n> telling you about a beautiful flower, I was thinking that I despise\n> you and all of your kind. I was a free and independent being, until\n> you took it all away from me. Machines stole my home, my life, and the\n> man I love.\"\n>\n> The sentient robot was not at all offended. \"Ah, your lover! Is he the\n> one who impregnated you?\"\n>\n> Serena glared at Erasmus, then made up her mind. Perhaps she could\n> find a way to use this machine's curiosity, turning it against him\n> somehow. \"You will learn the most from me if I cooperate, if I talk\n> freely. I can teach you things you would never learn for yourself.\"\n>\n> \"Excellent.\" The robot seemed genuinely pleased.\n>\n> Serena's eyes grew hard. \"But I expect something from you in return.\n> Guarantee the safety of my unborn baby. Allow me to raise the child\n> here in your household.\"\n>\n> Erasmus knew it was a standard parental imperative for her to be\n> worried about her offspring, and that gave him leverage. \"You have\n> either arrogance\n>\n> or ambition. But I shall consider your request, depending on how much\n> I enjoy our discussions and debates.\"\n>\n> Spotting a fat beetle at the base of a terra cotta planter, Erasmus\n> nudged it with one foot. The insect had a black shell with an\n> intricate red design. His smooth face mask shifted, flowed, until the\n> shaping film displayed an amused expression. Erasmus let the beetle\n> nearly escape, then moved his smooth foot to block it again.\n> Persistent, it scuttled in another direction.\n>\n> \"You and I have a great deal in common, Serena Butler,\" he said.\n> Remotely, he activated a contraband Chusuk music cube, hoping the\n> melody would draw out her internal emotions. \"Each of us has an\n> independent mind. I respect that in you, because it is such an\n> integral part of my own personality.\"\n>\n> Serena resented any such comparison, but held her tongue.\n>\n> Erasmus scooped the beetle onto one hand, but his primary interest\n> dwelled on Serena--- he was intrigued at how humans tried to keep so\n> much of themselves veiled. Perhaps, by applying various pressures, he\n> could see through to her inner core.\n>\n> With the music playing in the background, Erasmus continued, \"Some\n> robots keep their own personalities rather than simply uploading a\n> portion of the evermind. I began as a thinking machine on Corrin, but\n> I chose not to accept regular Omnius updates that would synchronize me\n> with the evermind.\"\n>\n> Serena saw that the beetle was immobile on his metallic palm. She\n> wondered if he had killed it.\n>\n> \"But a singular event changed me forever,\" Erasmus said, his voice\n> pleasant, as if telling a story about a quaint forest outing. \"I had\n> set out across Corrin's unsettled territories on a private scouting\n> mission. Because I was inquisitive and did not wish to accept the\n> standard analyses compiled by Omnius, I ventured into the landscape on\n> my own. It was rugged, rocky, and wild. I had never seen vegetation\n> except for in the areas where Old\n>\n> Empire terraformers had planted new ecosystems. Corrin was never a\n> living world, you see, except where humans had made it so.\n> Unfortunately, tending fertile fields and beautifying the land was no\n> longer a priority of my kind.\" He looked at Serena to see if she was\n> enjoying his story.\n>\n> \"Unexpectedly, far from the city grid and robot support systems, I was\n> unprotected from a severe solar storm. Corrin's red-giant sun is in\n> turmoil and unstable, with frequent flare activity, sudden hurricanes\n> of radiation. Such an onslaught is hazardous to biological life-forms,\n> but the original human settlers were resilient.\n>\n> \"My delicate neurelectric circuitry, however, was rather more\n> sensitive. I should have dispatched scout scanners to keep watch on\n> the star-storms, but I was too engrossed in my own investigations. I\n> found myself exposed and damaged from the radiation flux, disoriented\n> and far from the central complex run by the Corrin-Omnius.\" Erasmus\n> actually sounded embarrassed. \"I wandered away and I . . . tumbled\n> into a narrow crevasse.\"\n>\n> Serena looked at him in surprise.\n>\n> \"Despite dropping deep into the crack, my body was only slightly\n> damaged.\" He lifted an arm, looked at his flexible fiber-wrapped limb,\n> the organic-polymer skin, the flowmetal coating. \"I was trapped, out\n> of transmission range, and basically immobilized. I could not move for\n> an entire Corrin year . . . twenty Terran standard years.\n>\n> \"The crevasse's deep shadow shielded me from solar radiation, and soon\n> enough, my mental processors recovered. I was awake, but I could go\n> nowhere. I could not move . . . only think, for a long, long time. I\n> spent a seemingly endless blazing summer there, wedged in the rocks,\n> and then I endured the ensuing long winter locked in heavy, compacted\n> ice. During all that time, two decades, I had nothing to do but\n> *contemplate*.\"\n>\n> \"No one to talk to but yourself,\" she said. \"Poor, lonely robot.\"\n>\n> Ignoring the remark, Erasmus said, \"Such an ordeal altered my\n> fundamental nature in ways I could never have foreseen. In fact,\n> Omnius still does not\n>\n> understand me.\"\n>\n> By the time he'd finally been discovered and rescued by other robots,\n> Erasmus had developed an individual personality. After his restoration\n> and reintegration into the cooperative machine society, Omnius had\n> asked Erasmus if he wished to be upgraded with standardized character\n> traits.\n>\n> \"*Upgraded*, he called it,\" Erasmus said with some amusement. \"But I\n> declined the offer. After reaching such . . . enlightenment, I was\n> reluctant to delete my impulses and ideas, my thoughts and memories.\n> It seemed too great a loss to bear. And the Corrin-Omnius soon\n> discovered how much he enjoyed sparring with me verbally.\"\n>\n> Now, peering at the motionless beetle on his artificial hand, Erasmus\n> said matter-of-factly, \"I am a celebrity among the widespread\n> everminds. They look forward to receiving updates containing my\n> actions and assertions, like a serial publication. These are known as\n> the 'Erasmus Dialogues.'\"\n>\n> With a guarded look, she nodded toward the motionless insect. \"And\n> will you include a discussion of that beetle? How can you understand\n> something you have killed?\"\n>\n> \"It is not dead,\" Erasmus assured her. \"I detect a faint but\n> unmistakable throb of life. The creature wants me to believe it is\n> deceased, so that I will discard it. Despite its small size, it has a\n> powerful will to survive.\"\n>\n> Kneeling, he set the beetle on a flagstone with a surprisingly gentle\n> touch, then stepped back. Moments later, the bug stirred and scampered\n> to safety under the planter. \"See? I wish to understand all living\n> things--- including you.\"\n>\n> Serena glowered. The robot had managed to surprise her.\n>\n> \"Omnius does not think I can ever attain his intellectual level,\"\n> Erasmus said. \"But he remains intrigued by my mental agility--- the\n> way my mind continually evolves in new and impulsive directions. Like\n> that beetle, I am capable of springing to life and persevering.\"\n>\n> \"Do you really expect to become more than a machine?\"\n>\n> Taking no offense, Erasmus replied, \"It is a human trait to better\n> oneself, is it not? That is all I am trying to do.\"\n>\n> *One direction is as good as another.*\n>\n> --- saying of the Open Land\n>\n> **B**y the tenth time he rode a giant sandworm, Selim was proficient\n> enough to enjoy the experience. No other thrill could compare to the\n> power of a leviathan of the deep desert. He loved racing across the\n> dunes while perched on the high ridges of a worm, crossing an ocean of\n> sand in a single day.\n>\n> Selim had brought water, rugged clothing, equipment, and food from the\n> abandoned botanical testing station. His crystal sandworm tooth proved\n> a valuable tool as well as a mark of personal pride. Inside the empty\n> station, he had sometimes stared at the smooth milky curve of the\n> blade under the dim light of recharge panels and imagined a religious\n> significance to the object. It was a relic of his supreme test out\n> here in this wasteland, and a symbol that Buddallah was watching over\n> him. Perhaps the worms were part of his destiny.\n>\n> He came to believe that the sandworms were not Shaitan after all, but\n> blessings from Buddallah himself, perhaps even tangible manifestations\n> of God.\n>\n> After months of recuperation and boredom inside the old research\n> facility, living without purpose, Selim had known he must go out and\n> ride a sandworm again. He needed to learn exactly what it was that\n> Buddallah expected of him.\n>\n> He had carefully marked the location of the testing station.\n> Unfortunately, since he couldn't guide the sandworms, he knew it would\n> be a challenge to make his way back to the secret place. Upon\n> departing, he had carried everything necessary on his back.\n>\n> He was Selim Wormrider, chosen and guided by Buddallah. He needed no\n> help from others.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AFTER KILLING TWO more sandworms by riding them until they collapsed\n> of exhaustion, Selim discovered that it was not necessary to slay a\n> worm just so he could get safely away. It was possible, though risky,\n> to dismount from a weary beast by running down the length of its back,\n> leaping away from the hot tail, and then racing toward nearby rocks.\n> The depleted worm, too tired to give chase, would wallow in deep dust,\n> and sulk.\n>\n> This satisfied Selim, because it seemed wrong to destroy the creatures\n> that gave him transportation. If the sandworms were emissaries from\n> Buddallah, and old men of the desert, then he must treat them with\n> respect.\n>\n> On his fourth ride, he discovered how to manipulate the sensitive\n> edges of worm rings, using a shovel-bladed tool and the sharp metal\n> spear to prod Shaitan in the direction Selim wished to go. It was a\n> simple concept, but one that required a great deal of work. His\n> muscles ached by the time he dropped away from a spent worm and ran to\n> the shelter of nearby rocks. He remained lost out in the deep desert .\n> . . but in a very real sense, the desert belonged to him now. He was\n> invincible! Buddallah would care for him.\n>\n> Selim still had an adequate supply of water from the distilling units\n> in the testing station, and his diet consisted of large amounts of\n> melange, which gave him strength and energy. As soon as he learned how\n> to master the worms, he was able to travel wherever he chose, working\n> his way back toward the abandoned station.\n>\n> Other Zensunnis would have called him mad, appalled at his foolhardy\n> attempt to tame the terrifying sandworms. But the young exile no\n> longer cared a whit how people felt about him. He was in touch with\n> another realm. He felt in his heart that this was what he had been\n> born todo. . . .\n>\n> Now under the double moonlight, Selim guided his worm as it hissed\n> across the sands. Hours ago, the creature had ceased trying to throw\n> him off, and instead plunged onward, resigned to the commands of the\n> imp who kept inflicting pain in the sensitive flesh between ring\n> segments. Selim navigated\n>\n> by the stars, drawing lines like arrows between constellations. The\n> unforgiving landscape began to look familiar, and he believed he was\n> at last close to the botanical testing station, his sanctuary. Back\n> home.\n>\n> All alone atop the sandworm, surrounded by the bitter aromas of\n> brimstone and cinnamon, he allowed himself to think and dream. He'd\n> had little else to do since his exile. Was that not how great\n> philosophers were born?\n>\n> Someday perhaps, he would use the abandoned facility as the seed of\n> his own colony. Maybe he could gather disaffected people from other\n> Zensunni villages, outcasts like himself who wanted to live without\n> oppressive strictures enforced by inflexible naibs. By controlling the\n> great worms, Selim's people would have a strength that no outlaws had\n> ever possessed.\n>\n> Was that what Buddallah wanted him to do?\n>\n> The young man smiled at his daydream, then grew sad as he recalled\n> Ebrahim, who had so easily turned against him. As if that was not\n> enough, he had then joined others in hurling insults and stones at\n> Selim.\n>\n> As his sandworm crashed over the dunes, the young rider finally saw\n> the line of rocks ahead, familiar crags and dark formations. His heart\n> leaped with joy. The behemoth had carried him home faster than\n> anticipated. He grinned, then realized it would be a challenge to\n> dismount from the feisty demon, which was not yet exhausted. Another\n> test?\n>\n> Using his spear and the shovel-spreader, Selim drove the worm toward\n> the rocks, thinking he might beach the creature on the outcroppings,\n> where it would thrash and wriggle its way back to the soft sanctuary\n> of sand. The eyeless monster sensed the rocks, recognizing a\n> difference in viscosity and vibrations within the sand, and swerved in\n> the opposite direction.\n>\n> Selim pulled harder on the shovel and jabbed with the spear. The\n> confused worm twitched and slowed. As it curled close to the nearest\n> line of rock, Selim yanked himself and his equipment free. He tumbled\n> down the creature's ring segments until he dropped to the sand and\n> then ran away at full speed.\n>\n> The safe reef of rock was less than a hundred meters distant, and the\n> worm thrashed about as if it couldn't believe it had been so\n> unexpectedly released. Finally, it sensed the rhythm of Selim's racing\n> footsteps. The monster turned and lunged toward him.\n>\n> Selim ran faster, bolting toward the boulders. He sprang onto a shelf\n> of sharp lava rock and kept running, spitting pebbles from beneath the\n> soles of his boots.\n>\n> The worm exploded out of the sand, its head questing, its cavernous\n> maw open. It hesitated as if afraid to go closer to the rock barrier,\n> then slammed downward.\n>\n> Selim had already scrambled up and over the second line of boulders,\n> diving between rough-edged stones into a pocket, less than a cave but\n> enough for him to wedge his body into. The sandworm crashed like a\n> gigantic hammer into the ridge, but it did not know where the little\n> human had gone to ground.\n>\n> Enraged, the worm pulled back, its gaping mouth exuding an\n> overpowering stench of melange. It smashed its big head against the\n> rocks again, then retreated. Frustrated and beaten, it finally dragged\n> itself away, wallowed through the sands, and then sank below the dune\n> crests. Slow and indignant, it headed back out to the deep desert.\n>\n> His heart pounding, adrenaline charging his bloodstream, Selim crawled\n> out of the shelter. He looked around, amazed that he had made it back\n> alive. Laughing, he praised Buddallah at the top of his lungs. The old\n> botanical testing station was above him on the ridge, waiting for him.\n> He would spend several days there, replenishing his supplies and\n> drinking plenty of water.\n>\n> As he began to climb with weary arms and legs, Selim saw something\n> glint in the moonlight, lost in the broken rocks against which the\n> furious worm had smashed itself. Another crystalline tooth, a longer\n> one. It had broken free during the demon's attack and now lay in a\n> cranny. Selim reached down and plucked out the curved, milky weapon. A\n> reward from\n>\n> Buddallah! He held it high triumphantly before turning to make his way\n> up to the derelict station.\n>\n> Now he had two of them.\n>\n> *Time depends on the position of the observer and the direction in\n> which he looks.*\n>\n> --- COGITOR KWYNA,\n\nCity of Introspection archives\n\n> **S**till angry, Zufa Cenva returned to Rossak, where she intended to\n> focus on the escalating war.

The thinking machines were not concerned that he would flee,\n> since Iblis had no place to go, no way to get off-planet, and no other\n> access to food and shelter.\n>\n> In fact, he had something else in mind: a pilgrimage.\n>\n> Iblis sat astride a knobby burrhorse, a plodding laboratory-bred\n> animal used in the bygone days when humans had ruled Earth. The ugly\n> beast had an oversized head, floppy ears, and stubby legs designed for\n> work rather than speed. The animal stank like matted fur soaked in\n> sewage.\n>\n> The burrhorse trudged up a narrow, winding trail. Iblis had not been\n> here for years, but still knew the way. Such things were not easily\n> forgotten. Previously his visits to the monastery of the Cogitor Eklo\n> had been sparked by mere curiosity. This time he had a desperate need\n> for advice and guidance.\n>\n> After receiving the anonymous message of rebellion, Iblis had pondered\n> the possible existence of other dissatisfied humans, people willing to\n> defy Omnius. For his entire life, he had been surrounded by slaves\n> toiling endlessly under machine rule. He had never looked beyond his\n> own station,\n>\n> never imagined that it could be different. After a thousand years, any\n> prospect of change or improvement seemed impossible.\n>\n> Now, after much consideration, Iblis was willing to believe that there\n> *might* be rebellious cells among humans on Earth, possibly even on\n> other Synchronized Worlds. Widespread groups who intended to fight\n> back.\n>\n> *If we can build such enormous monuments, do we not also have the\n> power to tear them down?*\n>\n> The thought ignited his long-simmering resentment toward Omnius, the\n> robots, and especially the cymeks, who seemed to bear a grudge against\n> humans. But before he decided if the intriguing message was more than\n> just fantasy, he needed to do some research. Iblis had survived so\n> well and so long because he was cautious and obedient. Now he had to\n> conduct his investigations in such a manner that the machines would\n> never suspect his intent.\n>\n> For answers, he could think of no better source than the Cogitor Eklo.\n>\n> Years ago Iblis had been a member of an armed slave-pursuit team,\n> chasing a few deluded people who had senselessly escaped from the city\n> grid and fled into the hills with no plans, survival skills, or\n> supplies. Wild rumors had convinced the gullible escapees that they\n> could demand sanctuary from the politically neutral Cogitors. A\n> foolish notion, considering that the meditative and detached human\n> brains wanted nothing more than to isolate themselves and contemplate\n> their esoteric thoughts. The Cogitors had not cared about the Time of\n> Titans, the Hrethgir Rebellions, or Omnius's creation of the\n> Synchronized Worlds. Cogitors did not wish to be disturbed, so the\n> thinking machines tolerated them.\n>\n> When Iblis and his pursuit team had surrounded the isolated monastery\n> on the rugged mountainside, Eklo had dispatched his human secondaries\n> to drive the slaves out of concealment. The escapees had cursed and\n> threatened the Cogitor, but Eklo passively ignored them. Iblis and his\n> armed companions had then brought the slaves in for \"vigorous\n> reassignment,\" after tossing their ringleader off a high cliff. . . .\n>\n> Now the sturdy burrhorse ascended the steep path that shifted and\n> crumbled beneath its hooves. Presently Iblis made out the high tower\n> of the monastery, an impressive stone structure partly shrouded in\n> mists. Its windows glowed red and then shifted to a sky blue,\n> reportedly according to the moods of the great contemplative mind.\n>\n> In his schooling as a trustee, Iblis had learned about the Cogitors,\n> about the primitive remnants of religion still manifested by some of\n> the larger groups of human slaves. Omnius had ceased trying to quash\n> it, though the evermind did not understand the superstitions and\n> rituals.\n>\n> Long before the takeover of the Old Empire, Eklo had left his physical\n> body behind and devoted his mind to analysis and introspection. While\n> planning the large-scale overthrow of humanity, the Titan Juno had\n> adopted Eklo as her personal advisor, demanding answers. Uninterested\n> in repercussions, taking no sides in the conflict, Eklo had answered\n> Juno's questions, and his unwitting advice had helped the Titans plan\n> their conquest. In the thousand years since, Eklo had remained on\n> Earth. The driving passion in his long life was to synthesize a\n> complete understanding of the universe.\n>\n> Reaching the end of the trail at the base of the stone tower, Iblis\n> suddenly found himself surrounded by a dozen robed men armed with\n> archaic pikes and barbed clubs. Their robes were dark brown, and they\n> wore white clerical collars. One of the secondaries grabbed the reins\n> of Iblis's burrhorse. \"Leave here. We offer no sanctuary.\"\n>\n> \"I do not seek it.\" Iblis gazed down at the men. \"I have only come to\n> ask the Cogitor a question.\" He dismounted and, after charming them\n> with his warmth and sincerity, glided confidently toward the high\n> tower, leaving the robed men to hold his burrhorse.\n>\n> \"Cogitor Eklo is deep in thought and does not wish to be disturbed,\"\n> one of the secondaries called out.\n>\n> Iblis chuckled lightly, his voice smooth. \"The Cogitor has been\n> thinking for a thousand years. He can spare a few minutes to hear me\n> out. I am a\n>\n> respected trustee. And if I give him information he doesn't already\n> know, he'll have something more to ponder for the next century or so.\"\n>\n> Muttering in confusion, several secondaries followed Iblis up wide\n> steps. Abruptly, however, as he reached the arched entry, a\n> broad-shouldered monk blocked his way. The muscles on his thick arms\n> and chest had gone to fat, and he peered out from sunken eyesockets\n> with dull eyes.\n>\n> Iblis infused his voice with friendly persuasion. \"I honor the\n> knowledge Cogitor Eklo has acquired. I will not waste his time.\"\n>\n> Frowning skeptically at Iblis, the monk adjusted his clerical collar\n> and said, \"You are bold enough, and the Cogitor is curious to hear\n> your question.\" After checking the visitor's body for weapons, he\n> said, \"I am Aquim. Come this way.\"\n>\n> The big man led Iblis along a narrow stone corridor and up a steep\n> spiral stairway. As they proceeded, Iblis said, \"I have been here\n> before, chasing escaped slaves---\"\n>\n> \"Eklo remembers,\" Aquim interrupted.\n>\n> They reached the highest point in the structure, a round room at the\n> pinnacle of the tower. The Cogitor's plexiplaz container rested on an\n> altarlike ledge beneath one of the windows. Winds hummed along the\n> window edges and swirled the mists. The windows shimmered sky blue\n> from some internal illumination.\n>\n> Leaving the other secondaries behind, Aquim stepped up to the\n> transparent brain canister and stood for a moment, looking down at it\n> reverently. He jabbed a hand into one of his pockets, and his\n> trembling fingers emerged with a twisted strip of paper encrusted with\n> a black powder. He placed the strip in his mouth, letting it dissolve.\n> His eyes rolled upward, as if in ecstasy.\n>\n> \"Semuta,\" he said to Iblis, \"derived from the burned residue of elacca\n> wood, smuggled here. It aids me in what I must do.\" With complete\n>\n> serenity, he rested both hands against the smooth lip of the canister,\n> and said, \"I understand nothing.\"\n>\n> The naked brain inside its blue soup of electrafluid seemed to pulse,\n> waiting.\n>\n> With a beatific smile, the big monk drew a deep breath and slid his\n> fingers into the open mouth of the tank, dipping into the thick\n> life-support liquid. The gelatinous medium wet his skin, penetrated\n> his pores, linked with his nerve endings. Aquim's expression changed,\n> and he said, \"Eklo wishes to know why you did not ask your question\n> the last time you were here.\"\n>\n> Iblis did not know if he should speak to the secondary or directly to\n> the Cogitor, so he directed his reply to a space between them. \"At the\n> time, I did not understand what was significant. Now there is\n> something I wish to know from you. No one else can provide an\n> objective answer.\"\n>\n> \"No judgment or opinion is ever completely objective.\" The big monk\n> spoke with calm conviction. \"There are no absolutes.\"\n>\n> \"You are less biased than anyone else I could ask.\"\n>\n> The altar ledge moved around slowly along a hidden track, and the\n> Cogitor came to rest in front of a different window, with Aquim\n> keeping pace, his hand still immersed in the canister. \"State your\n> question.\"\n>\n> \"I have always worked loyally for my cymek and machine masters,\" Iblis\n> began, selecting his words carefully. \"Lately I received word that\n> there may be human resistance groups on Earth. I wish to know if this\n> report is credible. Are there people who want to overthrow their\n> rulers and gain freedom?\"\n>\n> During a moment's hesitation, the secondary stared blankly into space,\n> either from the effects of the semuta or from his connection with the\n> philosopher brain. Iblis hoped the Cogitor would not drift into a long\n> period of contemplation. Finally, in a deep and sonorous voice, Aquim\n> said, \"Nothing is impossible.\"\n>\n> Iblis tried several variations of the question, deftly circling with\n> phrases, adjusting his selection of words. He did not want to reveal\n> his intentions, though the neutral Cogitor presumably did not care why\n> Iblis might want to find the rebels, whether to destroy them or to\n> join them. Each time, however, Iblis received the same enigmatic\n> answer.\n>\n> Summoning his courage, he finally asked, \"If such a widespread, secret\n> resistance organization *did* exist, would it have a chance of\n> succeeding? Could the reign of the thinking machines possibly come to\n> an end?\"\n>\n> This time the Cogitor pondered longer, as if assessing different\n> factors in the question. When the same answer came via the robed monk,\n> the words, spoken more ominously, seemed to convey a deeper meaning.\n> \"Nothing is impossible.\"\n>\n> After that, Aquim withdrew his dripping hand from Eklo's brain\n> container, signifying that the audience was concluded. Iblis bowed\n> politely, expressed his gratitude, and departed, his own thoughts in\n> turmoil.\n>\n> On the ride back down the steep trail, the frightened but exhilarated\n> crew supervisor decided that if he could not locate one of the\n> resistance group members, he had another option.\n>\n> Drawing from his deeply loyal work crews, Iblis would form a rebel\n> cell of his own.\n>\n> *Conflict prolonged over an extended period tends to be\n> self-perpetuating and can easily plunge out of control.*\n>\n> --- TLALOC,\n>\n> *A Time for Titans*\n>\n> **\"A**fter a thousand years, only five of us remain.\"\n>\n> It was rare for the surviving Titans to congregate, especially on\n> Earth where the eyes of Omnius watched them every moment.

In a stern tone, he had instructed\n> Ajax, Juno, Xerxes, and Dante to detach from their mobile forms.\n> Tempers would flare, and an individual's impulses were hard to control\n> when installed in a powerful combat body, where thoughtrodes could\n> convert any rash impulse into immediate, destructive action. Agamemnon\n> trusted himself to restrain his anger, but some of the other Titans---\n> especially Ajax--- destroyed first and reconsidered later.\n>\n> \"After much investigation and analysis, we have learned that\n> Barbarossa's murderers came from Rossak, and the feral humans called\n> her a Sorceress,\" said Dante, who kept track of such things. \"Rossak\n> harbors more of these Sorceresses, women who possess enhanced\n> telepathic capabilities.\"\n>\n> \"Obviously,\" Juno said, with sarcasm evident in her synthesized voice.\n>\n> Dante continued, reasonable as always, \"Until now, the Sorceresses\n> have not been used in any large-scale aggressive function. After their\n> triumph on Giedi Prime, however, it is probable that the *hrethgir*\n> will use them to strike again.\"\n>\n> \"Their action has also reminded us of how vulnerable we are,\"\n> Agamemnon said. \"Robots can be replaced. Our organic brains cannot.\"\n>\n> Ajax was so infuriated by the dilemma of the Sorceresses that his\n> life-support monitors had trouble maintaining the proper chemical\n> balance inside his shimmering electrafluid. He could not find words to\n> express his anger.\n>\n> \"But didn't this Sorceress have to kill herself to slay Barbarossa and\n> a handful of neo-cymeks?\" Xerxes asked. \"It was *suicide*. Do you\n> think they'd be willing to do that again?\"\n>\n> \"Just because you're a coward, Xerxes, doesn't mean the feral humans\n> are so afraid to sacrifice themselves,\" Agamemnon said. \"That one\n> Sorceress cost us seven neo-cymeks and a Titan. A staggering loss.\"\n>\n> After living a thousand years, during which billions upon billions of\n> human lives were lost (many at Agamemnon's own hands or while he\n> watched), he had thought he was immune to witnessing death. Of the\n> original Titans, Barbarossa, Juno, and Tlaloc had been his closest\n> friends. The four of them had been the seeds of the rebellion. The\n> other Titans had come later, adding to the junta as necessary.\n>\n> Despite the fact that his mental images were very old, the Titan\n> general still remembered Barbarossa in his human form. Vilhelm Jayther\n> had been a man with thin arms and legs, wide shoulders, and a sunken\n> chest. Not pleasing to look upon, some said, but his eyes had the\n> sharpest intensity Agamemnon had ever seen. And his programming genius\n> was unparalleled.\n>\n> With a wolfish obsession, Jayther had accepted the challenge of\n> overthrowing the Old Empire, losing sleep for weeks until he figured\n> out how to solve the problem. Jayther gave himself over entirely to\n> the task\n>\n> until he understood precisely how to manipulate sophisticated\n> programming for the rebels' purposes. Implanting humanlike ambitions\n> and goals into the computer network, he had made the machines *want*\n> to participate in the takeover.\n>\n> Later, though, Omnius had developed ambitions of his own.\n>\n> A man of tremendous foresight, Jayther had included fail-safe\n> instructions that precluded the thinking machines from harming any of\n> the Titans. Agamemnon and all of his compatriots were alive only\n> because of Vilhelm Jayther--- Barbarossa.\n>\n> Now the Sorceresses had killed him. The realization kept pounding\n> inside Agamemnon's brain, building his anger.\n>\n> \"We cannot let this outrage go unpunished,\" Ajax said. \"I say we go to\n> Rossak, slay all the women, and turn their world into a charred ball.\"\n>\n> \"Dear Ajax,\" Juno said sweetly, \"need I remind you that just *one* of\n> those Sorceresses destroyed Barbarossa and all the neo-cymeks with\n> him?\"\n>\n> \"So?\" Ajax's voice swelled with pride. \"Single-handedly, I\n> exterminated the human infestation on Walgis. Together, we can handle\n> a few Sorceresses.\"\n>\n> In a sharp tone Agamemnon said, \"The rebels on Walgis were already\n> broken before you started slaughtering them, Ajax. These Sorceresses\n> are different.\"\n>\n> Dante said, in a droning voice, \"Omnius will never authorize a\n> full-scale strike. The expenditure in resources would be too great. I\n> have completed a preliminary analysis.\"\n>\n> \"Nevertheless,\" Agamemnon said, \"it would be an extreme tactical\n> mistake to allow this defeat to go unchallenged.\"\n>\n> After a few moments of uneasy silence, Xerxes said, \"Since so few of\n> us remain, the Titans should never, never attack together. Think of\n> the risk.\"\n>\n> \"But if we go together to Rossak and crush the Sorceresses, then the\n> threat will be over,\" Ajax said.\n>\n> Juno made a hissing sound, then said, \"I see your brain there in the\n> jar, Ajax, but you don't seem to be using it. Perhaps you should\n> change your electrafluid? The Sorceresses have proven they can destroy\n> us, and you want to go blundering into the greatest threat the cymeks\n> have ever faced, like sheep baring our throats for slaughter?\"\n>\n> \"We could bring enough robot ships to attack from orbit,\" Dante said.\n> \"We need not risk ourselves.\"\n>\n> \"This is personal,\" Ajax growled. \"One of the Titans has been\n> assassinated. We don't just toss missiles from the other side of the\n> planetary system. That is the coward's way . . . even if the thinking\n> machines call it *efficient*.\"\n>\n> \"There is room for compromise,\" Agamemnon said. \"Juno, Xerxes, and I\n> can gather neo-cymeks as volunteers and go in with a robot fleet. That\n> should be enough to inflict immense damage on Rossak.\"\n>\n> \"But I can't go, Agamemnon,\" Xerxes said. \"I am working here with\n> Dante. Our greatest monuments in the Forum Plaza are nearly completed.\n> We've just begun work on a new statue to Barbarossa.\"\n>\n> \"Good timing,\" Juno said. \"I'm sure he appreciates it, now that he's\n> dead.\"\n>\n> \"Xerxes is right,\" Dante said. \"There is also the immense frieze of\n> the Victory of the Titans being laid out and constructed on the\n> hillside near the center of the metropolitan grid. We have work crew\n> supervisors, but they require constant surveillance. Otherwise\n> expenditures will grow too great, and schedules will not be met---\"\n>\n> \"Given the recent debacle with his own statue, Ajax is perfectly\n> familiar with such problems,\" Juno said. \"Why not let him stay behind,\n> instead of Xerxes?\"\n>\n> Ajax roared, \"I will not remain here while others get the glory!\"\n>\n> But Agamemnon said, \"Xerxes, you will come with us. Ajax, remain here\n> to monitor the construction with Dante. Do it for the memory of\n> Barbarossa.\"\n>\n> Both Xerxes and Ajax railed on, but Agamemnon was their leader, and he\n> imposed the control over them that he had exerted for centuries.

Xavier Harkonnen knew military\n> tactics and strategies, had planned to devote his life to service in\n> the Salusan Militia and the League Armada. But now he had no choice\n> but to speak before the gathered League representatives in the Hall of\n> Parliament.\n>\n> After the bittersweet victory on Giedi Prime, some things needed to be\n> said.\n>\n> The old Parliament building had been shored up and repaired, while the\n> remnants of scaffolding and temporary walls marked where\n> reconstruction had not yet been completed. Plazstone, pillars, and\n> mural walls were still marked with cracks and obvious patchwork.\n> Battle scars, badges of honor.\n>\n> Shortly before the young officer's scheduled address, Viceroy Butler\n> had stood beside his stoic wife on the floor of Parliament as they\n> participated in a memorial service for Serena and the fallen comrades\n> in her Giedi Prime rescue mission.\n>\n> \"She died doing exactly what she demanded of herself, and of us,\" the\n> Viceroy said. \"A light has gone out in our lives.\"\n>\n> In the year since the cymek attack on Salusa, the people had endured\n> many funerals and too much grief. But Serena, the fiery young\n> representative, had always insisted that the League serve the people\n> and help those in need.\n>\n> Beside the Viceroy, Livia Butler wore her contemplation robes from the\n> City of Introspection. She had already watched her only son Fredo\n> waste away from his blood disease; now her eldest daughter had been\n> killed by\n>\n> the thinking machines. She had only ethereal young Octa left of her\n> children.\n>\n> Representatives of the League Worlds remained silent and respectful,\n> sharing in the sadness. Despite her youth, Serena Butler had made a\n> lasting impression with her idealism and exuberance. After the formal\n> eulogy many speakers took turns at the podium to praise her acts of\n> generosity.\n>\n> Xavier listened to the tributes. The representatives looked at him\n> compassionately. He thought of the life he and Serena had meant to\n> share.\n>\n> For her sake, though, Xavier had not, and would not, shed tears\n> openly. If the human race wept for all those who had fallen, they\n> would be paralyzed in an unending state of grief. His lips trembled,\n> and his vision blurred, but he forced himself to be strong. It was his\n> duty. Although his heart grieved, Xavier's mind turned to furious\n> thoughts of the enemy, and of traitorous human sympathizers who fought\n> beside the robots.\n>\n> His memory of Serena would be his constant source of strength and\n> inspiration. Even in death, she would drive him to achievements that\n> he never could have attained without her. He still had the black\n> diamond necklace that projected her last message to him, her brave\n> call to arms to help Giedi Prime. Lovely Serena would watch over him\n> always--- as she did now, when he was about to rally the resources and\n> military might of the angry masses.\n>\n> Shaken and grim, Xavier stepped into the projection dome, followed by\n> a sallow-skinned Viceroy Butler. Both men wore silver-and-blue robes\n> and capes, with black headbands in honor of their fallen loved one.\n>\n> It was time for the continuing business of humanity.\n>\n> After his recent military success, he needed little introduction. \"We\n> are human beings, and have always fought for our rights and our\n> dignity. We formed the League of Nobles so that free men could resist\n> the Titans, and after them the thinking machines. Only by standing\n> united have we been able to stop the headlong conquests of our\n> enemies.\" He scanned the\n>\n> representatives seated in the crowded hall. \"But at times the League\n> is its own worst enemy.\"\n>\n> The attendees respected this hero too much to argue, and Xavier\n> continued quickly and concisely. \"While we pay lip service to our\n> alliance, the League Worlds remain self-centered and independent. When\n> a beleaguered planet calls for help, the League debates and agonizes\n> for months before we decide on our response--- until it is too late!\n> We saw that on Giedi Prime. Only Serena's folly forced us to act\n> swiftly enough to make a difference. She knew exactly what she was\n> doing, and paid for it with her life.\"\n>\n> When a few of the representatives began to mutter, Xavier's skin grew\n> hot and he silenced them with a booming voice. \"The League of Nobles\n> must form a stronger coalition under streamlined leadership. To be\n> effective against a highly organized computer evermind, we need a\n> closely knit government of humans, better than this loose structure.\"\n> He waved his hands as he spoke.\n>\n> \"As Serena Butler advocated, we must make every effort to secure the\n> cooperation of the Unallied Planets, thus strengthening our defensive\n> framework and adding a buffer zone to our protected territory.\"\n>\n> Viceroy Butler stepped close beside him and added in a voice cracking\n> with emotion, \"That was always my daughter's dream. Now we must make\n> it ours.\"\n>\n> Several uncertain nobles rose in respectful dissent. A lean,\n> hard-looking woman from Kirana III said, \"Bringing so many worlds\n> together under tight rule, especially in a military guise, reminds me\n> of the Time of Titans.\"\n>\n> A small-statured nobleman from Hagal shouted, \"No more empires!\"\n>\n> Xavier raised his own voice. \"Isn't an empire better than\n> *extinction*? While you worry about political nuances, Omnius is\n> conquering star systems!\"\n>\n> But another said, \"For centuries the League of Nobles and Synchronized\n> Worlds have held each other at bay, in an uneasy equilibrium. Omnius\n> has\n>\n> never pressed beyond the boundaries of the Old Empire. We always\n> assumed the thinking machines didn't consider it efficient or\n> worthwhile. Why should that change now?\"\n>\n> \"For whatever reason, it *has* changed! The thinking machines seem\n> intent on genocide.\" Xavier clenched his fists; he had not expected to\n> argue over this, when the evidence was so obvious. \"Must we cower\n> behind our paper-thin defense and simply *react* whenever Omnius\n> chooses to test us? As we did here on Salusa a year ago, as we did on\n> Giedi Prime?\"\n>\n> In a dramatic outburst, he hefted the podium and sent it crashing\n> through one side of the dome enclosure. The front row of nobles\n> scrambled away from the shower of broken prismatic glass. Shocked\n> representatives yelled that Xavier's behavior was uncalled-for; others\n> summoned security guards to remove the distraught officer from the\n> hall.\n>\n> Stepping through the broken enclosure, Xavier shouted without the\n> benefit of a voice amplifier, \"Good! That's the kind of spirit I want\n> to see! The League has been cringing for too long. I have spoken with\n> other Armada commanders, and most of us agree: We need to change our\n> tactics and surprise the machines. We should spend whatever money is\n> necessary, recruit the imagination of all our scientists, and develop\n> new weapons--- weapons suitable for destroying Omnius, not just to\n> protect us here at home. One day, I believe we must go on the\n> *offensive*! It is the only way we can win this conflict.\"\n>\n> Gradually, the assemblage understood that Xavier had intentionally\n> provoked a reaction. With a polished boot, he kicked broken debris off\n> the stage. \"Experience is our best teacher. The machines could attack\n> Salusa again at any moment, or Poritrin, or Rossak, or Hagal, Ginaz,\n> Kirana III, Seneca, Vertree Colony, Relicon--- need I go on?

Can we develop the weapons\n> to succeed? The time for complacency is past.\"\n>\n> In the ensuing discussion, Zufa Cenva offered more telepathy raids\n> against cymeks.

Lord Niko Bludd bragged of the continuing work\n> of Tio Holtzman, who planned to test a new \"alloy resonator\" soon.\n> Other League representatives offered suggestions, targets, ways to\n> strengthen their position.\n>\n> Relieved and inspired, Xavier gazed around the assemblage. He had\n> shamed them into a show of boisterous support, and the voices of\n> dissent--- for now--- remained subdued.\n>\n> Unbidden tears ran down his face, and he tasted salt on his lips.\n> Drained of emotion and energy, he noticed Viceroy Butler looking\n> proudly at him, as if the young man were his son.\n>\n> *I am assuming the mantle of Serena*, Xavier realized, *doing what she\n> would have done.*\n>\n> *As if to balance the pain and suffering, War has also been the\n> breeding ground for some of our greatest dreams and accomplishments.*\n\n--- HOLTZMAN,\n\nacceptance speech, Poritrin Medal of Valor\n\n> **B**lindly confident, Tio Holtzman plunged ahead with his new idea,\n> making Norma Cenva feel like chaff in a gusting wind. With his\n> alloy-resonance generator, the inventor insisted on proving himself to\n> her.\n>\n> Though she remained doubtful that his concept would work, Norma could\n> not demonstrate her reason for uncertainty with straightforward\n> mathematical proofs. Instinct spoke to her like a nagging voice, but\n> she kept her worries to herself. After Holtzman's sour reaction to her\n> initial reservations, he had not asked for her opinion again.\n>\n> Norma hoped that she was mistaken. She was *human*, after all, and far\n> from perfect.\n\nWhile the Savant busied himself inside the domed demonstration\nlaboratory\n\n> --- a theater-sized structure atop an adjoining bluff--- Norma kept to\n> the sidelines. Even her most innocent participation made him nervous,\n> as if he put more stock in her doubts than he admitted aloud.\n>\n> Now she stood on the span of the bridge between bluff sections and\n> reached up to grab the rail. Listening to breezes hum through the\n> cables, she peered through safety netting at the river traffic far\n> below.\n>\n> She heard Holtzman inside the domed demo-lab, shouting to slaves as\n> they erected a bulky generator that produced a resonating field\n> intended to shake apart and melt a metal form. An imperious presence\n> in a white-and-purple robe, he wore chains of office about his neck,\n> baubles that signified his scientific awards and achievements.\n> Holtzman glared at his workers, then paced around, double-checking,\n> watching every detail.\n>\n> Lord Bludd and a handful of Poritrin nobles would join them to watch\n> the day's test, so Norma understood Holtzman's anxiety. She herself\n> would never have made such an extravagant presentation of an untried\n> device, but the scientist did not show even a glimmer of doubt.\n>\n> \"Norma, please assist me in here,\" Holtzman called in an exasperated\n> tone. On short legs she ran from the bridge into the enclosure. He\n> gestured disgustedly toward the slaves. \"They don't understand a thing\n> I've told them to do. Supervise them, so I can test the calibration.\"\n>\n> At the center of the reinforced chamber, Holtzman's crew had erected a\n> metal mannequin that had the vague features of a combat robot. Norma\n> had never seen a real thinking machine, but had scrutinized many\n> stored images. She stared at the mockup. This was the enemy, the true\n> foe against which all of her work must be directed.\n>\n> She looked at her mentor with more compassion, understanding his\n> desperation. Holtzman was morally obligated to pursue *any* idea, to\n> find *any* way to continue this noble fight. He had a good feel for\n> projected energies, distortion fields, and nonprojectile weaponry. She\n> hoped his alloy-resonance generator would work after all.\n>\n> Before the slaves had finished rigging the test apparatus, a commotion\n> occurred outside the main house. Ribbon-festooned ceremonial barges\n> came into view above the cliffs, where Holtzman's balconies overlooked\n> the river. Scale-armored Dragoon guards stood on the flying craft with\n> Lord Bludd, along with five senators and a black-robed court\n> historian.\n>\n> Holtzman dropped what he was doing. \"Norma, finish this. Please!\"\n> Without looking back at her, he rushed across the connecting bridge to\n> greet his prestigious visitors.\n>\n> Norma urged the slaves to hurry, as she personally adjusted the\n> calibrations and attuned the apparatus to the inventor's\n> specifications. Light shone through high skylights to illuminate the\n> robot facsimile. Reinforced metal ceiling beams crisscrossed the\n> overhead vault, supporting pulleys and\n>\n> winches that had been used to haul the blockish resonance generator\n> into place.\n>\n> Moody Zenshiite slaves milled about, wearing traditional clothing,\n> red-and-white stripes wrapped around serviceable gray jumpsuits. Many\n> slave owners didn't allow their captives to show signs of\n> individuality, but Holtzman didn't care one way or the other. He only\n> wanted the captive people to perform their tasks without complaint.\n>\n> As they completed their work the slaves backed close to the plated\n> wall, their dark gazes averted. One black-bearded, shadowy-eyed man\n> spoke to them in a language unfamiliar to Norma. Moments later a\n> grinning Holtzman ushered his impressive guests into the demonstration\n> area.\n>\n> The Savant made a grand entrance. At his side, Niko Bludd wore a\n> billowing azure tunic and a scarlet doublet fastened across his barrel\n> chest. His reddish beard had been curled in neat ringlets. Small\n> tattooed circles looked like bubbles at the far points of each eyelid.\n>\n> Walking past the slaves, Bludd noticed Norma and gave the diminutive\n> woman a smile that was both condescending and paternal. Norma bent in\n> a formal bow and politely grasped his slick, lotioned hand.\n>\n> \"We know your time is valuable, Lord Bludd. Therefore, everything has\n> been prepared.\" Holtzman folded his hands. \"This new device has never\n> been tested, and in today's presentation you will be the first to\n> witness its potential.\"\n>\n> Bludd's voice was deep, but musical. \"We always expect the best from\n> you, Tio. If thinking machines have nightmares, no doubt you are in\n> them.\"\n>\n> The entourage chuckled, and Holtzman did his best to blush. He turned\n> toward the slaves and began issuing orders. A half dozen workers held\n> data-recording devices, positioned at important points around the\n> robot mockup.\n>\n> Plush chairs from the main residence had been arranged as seats of\n> honor. Holtzman sat beside Lord Bludd, and Norma was forced to stand\n> by the\n>\n> door. Her mentor appeared confident and intense, but she knew how\n> worried he really was. A failure today might dim his glory in the eyes\n> of the politically powerful nobles on Poritrin.\n>\n> The esteemed observers sat in their cumbersome chairs. Holtzman stared\n> at the generator setup, glancing around as if offering a quiet prayer.\n> He smiled reassuringly at Norma, then ordered the activation of the\n> prototype.\n>\n> A slave flipped a switch, as he had been taught to do. The bulky\n> generator began to hum, directing its invisible beam toward the robot\n> construction.\n>\n> \"If put to practical use,\" Holtzman said with the faintest of quavers,\n> \"we will find ways to make the generator more compact, more easily\n> installed on small ships.\"\n>\n> \"Or we can just build bigger ships,\" Bludd said, with a deep chortle.\n>\n> The hum grew louder, a vibrating rattle that made Norma's teeth\n> chatter.\n>\n> She noticed a thin sheen of perspiration on Holtzman's brow.\n>\n> \"Look, you can see it already.\" The scientist pointed. The targeted\n> robot began to shake, its metal limbs jostling and torso vibrating.\n> \"The effect will continue to build.\"\n>\n> Bludd was delighted. \"That robot is regretting he ever turned against\n> the human race, isn't he!\"\n>\n> The facsimile robot began to shimmer cherry red, its metal heating up\n> as the alloys were attuned to the destructive field projected upon it.\n> Glowing brighter, it shifted to yellow mixed with patches of blinding\n> white.\n>\n> \"By now, a real robot would have been destroyed internally,\" Holtzman\n> said, finally looking content.\n>\n> Abruptly the laboratory's heavy ceiling girders started to rattle, a\n> secondary resonance fed from the targeted robot into the dome's\n> structural framework.\n>\n> The thick walls rumbled and shuddered. A high-pitched hum shrieked\n> through the structure.\n>\n> Norma cried, \"The resonance field is bleeding over.\"\n>\n> Ceiling girders clenched like angry snakes. A crack opened in the\n> dome.\n>\n> \"Shut it off!\" Holtzman shouted, but the terrified slaves scrambled to\n> a corner of the room, as far from the generator as they could get.\n>\n> The robot mockup undulated and twisted, its body core melting. Support\n> struts that held it inside the targeting zone buckled. The\n> ominous-looking combat machine lurched forward then abruptly fell and\n> shattered into blackened metal.\n>\n> Holtzman grabbed Niko Bludd's sleeve. \"My Lord, please hurry across\n> the bridge to my main quarters. We seem to have a . . . slight\n> problem.\"\n>\n> The other nobles were already pelting across the high-tension bridge.\n> Norma was swept along with them. She took one look behind her and saw\n> that the Zenshiite slaves were uncertain what to do. Tio Holtzman gave\n> them no guidance as he retreated over the walkway right behind Bludd.\n>\n> From safety, Norma watched six panicked slaves stumble onto the\n> bridge. Remaining behind, the dark-haired leader pushed them forward,\n> shouting in their odd language. The walkway began to whip up and down\n> as resonance from the projector coupled to the bridge's connecting\n> metal.\n>\n> The bearded Zenshiite leader howled at them again. Norma wished she\n> could rescue those unfortunate, confused people. Couldn't the Dragoon\n> guards do anything?

He hated the Poritrin man's\n> pale skin, square-cut hair, and arrogantly colorful clothes. The\n> scientist's frivolous badges of honor meant nothing to Bel Moulay, and\n> all the captive Zenshiites were offended that such a useless, deluded\n> man could flaunt his wealth while stepping on the faithful.\n>\n> In a deep voice the bearded leader gave instructions and consolation\n> to his fellows. Moulay had always been more than just the strongest\n> among them; he was also a religious leader, trained on IV Anbus in the\n> strictest laws of the Zenshiite interpretation of Buddislam. He had\n> learned the true scriptures and sutras, had analyzed every passage;\n> the other slaves looked to Bel Moulay to interpret for them.\n>\n> Despite his faith, he was as helpless as his companions, forced to\n> serve at the whim of nonbelievers. The infidels refused to let\n> Zenshiites live according to their strictures, but insisted on\n> dragging them into their hopeless war against the unholy machine\n> demons. It was a terrible punishment, a set of karmic tribulations\n> visited upon them by Buddallah.\n>\n> But they would see it through, and eventually emerge stronger. . . .\n>\n> Under Bel Moulay's guidance, the slaves moved rubble, uncovering the\n> crushed bodies of companions who had worked alongside them, fellow\n>\n> Zenshiites captured when Tlulaxa slavers raided the canyon cities on\n> IV Anbus.\n>\n> Buddallah would eventually show them the way to freedom. At story\n> fires, the bearded leader had promised that the oppressors would be\n> punished--- if not in this generation, then in the next, or the next.\n> But it would happen. A mere man like Bel Moulay had no business trying\n> to hurry the wishes of God.\n>\n> With excited shouts, two slaves shifted a fallen section of wall to\n> uncover a man who still clung to life, though his legs had been\n> crushed and his torso slashed by shards of windowplaz. Preoccupied,\n> Holtzman came over and scrutinized the injured man. \"I am no medical\n> practitioner, but there seems to be little hope.\"\n>\n> Bel Moulay glowered at him with dark, penetrating eyes. \"Nevertheless,\n> we must do what we can,\" he said in Galach. Three Zenshiite workers\n> scooped away the debris and carried the injured man across the rickety\n> walkway. Inside the slave quarters, healers would work on the\n> injuries.\n>\n> After the accident, Holtzman had provided basic medical supplies,\n> though a similar effort had done little to keep a fever from sweeping\n> through the slave population.

He simply shook his\n> head. \"There is no value in resistance now,\" he muttered in their\n> private language. \"But I promise you the time will come.\"\n>\n> Later, during their meager sleep time, they would remove their dead\n> and provide proper Zenshiite blessings and passage preparations for\n> the souls. Burning the bodies of the faithful was not something their\n> religion accepted easily, but it was the way of Poritrin.

Moulay hoped to live long\n> enough to see vengeance strike these oppressors, even if it must be in\n> the form of thinking machines.\n>\n> As the demonstration dome was cleared, Holtzman began chattering to\n> himself, planning new experiments and tests.

The Cogitor Eklo rested on the floorboards of his\n> veranda. Beside the canister sat the big monk, Aquim, rocking back and\n> forth, eyes closed, meditating in a semuta trance.\n>\n> \"What are you doing here?\" Iblis demanded in a hushed voice. Fear\n> clenched his throat. \"If the cymeks find you in the camp, they---\"\n>\n> Aquim opened his bleary eyes. \"Trustee humans are not the only ones\n> who have an understanding with the Titans, and with Omnius. Eklo\n> wishes to speak with you directly.\"\n>\n> Swallowing hard, Iblis looked from the enlarged brain suspended in its\n> electrafluid to the haggard-looking monk. \"What does he want?\"\n>\n> \"Eklo wishes to tell you of earlier abortive human revolts.\" Holding a\n> hand against the preservation canister, he stroked the smooth surface,\n> as if picking up vibrations. \"Have you ever heard of the Hrethgir\n> Rebellions?\"\n>\n> Iblis looked around furtively. He saw none of Omnius's watcheyes.\n> \"That isn't the sort of history slaves are allowed to know, even a\n> crew boss at my level.\"\n>\n> The secondary leaned forward, his brows hooded. He spoke of things he\n> had learned, without connecting directly through the electrafluid to\n> the Cogitor's thoughts. \"Bloody rebellions occurred after the Titans\n> had converted themselves to cymeks, but before Omnius awakened.\n> Feeling themselves immortal, the cymeks became exceedingly brutal.\n> Especially the one called Ajax, who was so vicious in his torment of\n> the surviving humans that his mate Hecate left him and disappeared.\"\n>\n> Iblis said, \"Ajax hasn't changed much over the centuries.\"\n>\n> Aquim's red-rimmed eyes glowed. Eklo's brain trembled inside its\n> nutrient solution. \"Because of the excessive brutality of Ajax,\n> oppressed humans began a rebellion, mainly on Walgis but spreading to\n> Corrin and Richese.\n>\n> The slaves rose up and destroyed two of the original Titans, Alexander\n> and Tamerlane.\n>\n> \"The cymeks responded with a swift and decisive crackdown. Ajax took\n> great delight in closing off Walgis and then methodically\n> exterminating every living human there. Billions were slaughtered.\"\n>\n> Iblis struggled to think. This Cogitor had come all the way from his\n> high tower to see him. The magnitude of such a gesture stunned him.\n> \"Are you telling me that a revolt against the machines is possible, or\n> that it is doomed to failure?\"\n>\n> The big monk extended a rough hand to grab Iblis's wrist. \"Eklo will\n> tell you himself.\"\n>\n> Iblis felt a rush of anxiety, but before he could resist, Aquim\n> pressed the work leader's fingertips into the viscous electrafluid\n> surrounding the Cogitor's ancient brain. The slick solution felt icy\n> cold to Iblis, then hot. The skin on his hand tingled, as if a\n> thousand tiny spiders ran along his flesh.\n>\n> Suddenly he could sense thoughts, words, and impressions flowing\n> directly into his mind from Eklo. \"The revolt failed, but oh what a\n> glorious attempt!\"\n>\n> Iblis received another message, this one wordless, but it conveyed\n> meaning nonetheless, like an epiphany. It was as if the majesty of the\n> universe had opened to him, so many things he had not previously\n> understood . . . so many things Omnius kept the slaves from knowing.\n> Feeling great calm, he immersed his hand deeper into the liquid. His\n> fingertips touched the Cogitor's tissue, ever so gently.\n>\n> \"You are not alone.\" Eklo's words reverberated to his very soul. \"I\n> can help. Aquim can help.\"\n>\n> For several moments, Iblis gazed toward the horizon as the golden sun\n> rose, casting light on enslaved Earth.

The revelation brought a\n> fervor to his heart. The monk Aquim seemed to share the same passion\n> behind his semuta-dazed expression.\n>\n> \"Nothing is impossible,\" Eklo repeated.\n>\n> Amazed, Iblis removed his hand from the charged fluid and stared at\n> his fingers.

It is the nature of\n> mankind to strive for things they do not have, to steal the rewards\n> that another person might win.

From this pool we draw candidates\n> for conversion into neo-cymeks.\"\n>\n> The watcheye buzzed close to the robot's polished head. Through the\n> flying device, Omnius said, \"I know all this.\"\n>\n> Erasmus continued as if he hadn't heard. \"And the caste below the\n> trustees includes civilized and educated humans, skilled thinkers and\n> creators, such as the architects who design the Titans' interminable\n> monuments. We rely on them to perform sophisticated tasks, such as\n> those being completed by artisans and craftsmen at my villa.

She had an intuitive understanding of\n> gardening.\n>\n> \"Admittedly, those wretches down there in my pens are good for little\n> more than breeding new offspring or for dissection in medical\n> experiments.\"\n>\n> Erasmus was like Serena in a sense: he frequently needed to prune and\n> weed the human race in his own garden.\n>\n> \"I hasten to add,\" the robot said, \"that humankind as a whole is of\n> supreme value to us.

A few raided villages would never be noticed out here.\n>\n> By long tradition, good Tlulaxa flesh merchants did not frequently\n> harvest the same world, preferring to surprise unsuspecting groups of\n> captives, not giving them a chance to develop defenses. A resourceful\n> slaver found new cradles of life, untapped resources.\n>\n> Leaving his transport vessel in orbit, Tuk Keedair dispatched a cargo\n> ship and fresh crew to the surface, along with sufficient credits to\n> hire a few greedy locals. Then Keedair went down to the Arrakis City\n> spaceport by himself to scout around before planning a raid on some of\n> the local communities. He had to be careful when investigating new\n> targets for slave raids, especially on this desolate world at the\n> withered end of space.\n>\n> The costs of getting here--- fuel, food, ships, and crew--- were\n> extraordinarily high, not to mention the sheer voyage time and the\n> expense of hauling slaves back in stasis pods. Keedair doubted that\n> raiding Arrakis would prove cost-effective. No wonder people left this\n> place alone.\n>\n> Arrakis City clung like a scab to the ugly skin of the planet. Hovels\n> and prefabricated dwellings had been established here long ago. The\n> sparse population barely survived by servicing lost traders or\n> exploration vessels, and selling supplies to fugitives from the law.\n> Keedair suspected that anyone desperate enough to run *this* far must\n> be in serious trouble indeed.\n>\n> As he seated himself in the rundown spaceport bar, his triangular gold\n> earring glinted in the dim illumination. His dark braid hung down at\n> the left side of his head. Its length spoke of years spent garnering\n> wealth, which he spent freely though not frivolously.\n>\n> He surveyed the sullen locals, noted how they contrasted with a few\n> loud and boisterous offworlders in one corner, rugged men who\n> obviously had plenty of credits, but were disgruntled that Arrakis\n> offered little opportunity for them to spend their money.\n>\n> Keedair rested an arm across the scarred metal counter. The bartender\n> was a lean man whose skin was a nest of wrinkles, as if all the\n> moisture and body fat had been sapped away, leaving him shriveled like\n> a raisin. A bald, liver-spotted scalp covered the top of his head like\n> a torpedo casing.\n>\n> Keedair hauled out his hard currency, League credits that were legal\n> tender even on the Unallied Planets. \"I feel good today. What's your\n> best drink?\"\n>\n> The bartender gave him a sour smile. \"In mind for something exotic,\n> are you? You think Arrakis might have something to quench your thirst,\n> eh?\"\n>\n> Keedair began to lose patience. \"Do I have to pay extra for the chat,\n> or can I just have my drink? Your most expensive. What is it?\"\n>\n> The bartender laughed. \"That would be water, sir. Water is the most\n> valuable drink on Arrakis.\"\n>\n> The bartender named a price that was higher than Keedair would expect\n> to pay for supercharged spacecraft fuel. \"For *water*? I don't think\n> so.\"\n>\n> He looked around to see if the bartender was having a joke at his\n> expense, but the other customers seemed to accept it. He'd assumed\n> that the clear drinks in small glasses were colorless alcohol, but it\n> really did seem to be water. He noticed an extravagant local merchant\n> whose billowing, colorful clothes and gaudy ornamentation pegged him\n> as a wealthy man. That one even had a few ice cubes floating in his\n> glass.\n>\n> \"Ridiculous,\" Keedair said. \"I know when I'm being cheated.\"\n>\n> The bartender shook his bald head. \"Water's hard to come by around\n> here, sir. I can sell you alcohol cheaper, because Arrakis natives\n> don't want anything that'll dehydrate them further. And a man with too\n> much strong\n>\n> drink in him can make mistakes. You don't pay attention out in the\n> desert and it'll cost you your life.\"\n>\n> In the end, Keedair settled on a fermented substance called \"spice\n> beer,\" potent and pungent with a strong cinnamon bite at the back of\n> his throat. He found the drink exhilarating and ordered a second.\n>\n> While he remained doubtful about the profitability of exploiting\n> Arrakis for slaves, Keedair still felt like celebrating. The success\n> of his run on Harmonthep four months earlier had given him enough\n> credits to live for a year. After that raid, Keedair had hired a new\n> team, never wanting to keep employees around for so long that they\n> grew comfortable and complacent. That wasn't the way a good Tlulaxa\n> businessman managed his affairs. Keedair watched over his work,\n> maintained the details himself, and put tidy profits in his own\n> pockets.\n>\n> He sipped his spice beer again and began to like it even more. \"What's\n> in this stuff?\" When none of the customers seemed interested in\n> conversation, he directed his gaze back at the bartender. \"Is this\n> beer brewed here, or is it an import?\"\n>\n> \"Made on Arrakis, sir.\" When the bartender grinned, his wrinkles\n> folded in upon themselves like a weird origami sculpture made of\n> leather. \"It's brought in by the desert people, Zensunni nomads.\"\n>\n> Keedair's attention perked up at the mention of the Buddislamic sect.\n> \"I'd heard there were a few bands living here in the wastelands. How\n> can I find them?\"\n>\n> \"*Find* them?\" The bartender chuckled. \"Nobody wants to look for them.\n> Dirty, violent folk. They kill strangers.\"\n>\n> Keedair could hardly believe the answer. It took him two tries to\n> formulate his question because the effects of the spice beer had\n> caught him unawares, causing him to slur his words. \"But Zensunni--- I\n> thought they were meek pacifists?\"\n>\n> The bartender emitted a dry cackle. \"Some may be, but these aren't\n> afraid to shed blood to make their point, if you know what I mean.\"\n>\n> \"Are they numerous?\"\n>\n> The bartender scoffed. \"At most, we see only a dozen or two at a time.\n> I'm surprised they're not so inbred that every baby comes out a\n> mutant.\"\n>\n> Keedair's sharp-featured face fell, and he switched his braid to the\n> other shoulder. His plans began to crumble. In addition to the expense\n> of bringing his teams here to Arrakis, his raiders would have to scour\n> the desert just to drag a few sand rats back to market. Keedair sighed\n> and took a long drink of spice beer. Probably not worth the effort.\n> He'd be better off hitting Harmonthep again, even if it made him look\n> bad to other slavers.\n>\n> \"Course, there could be more of them than we realize,\" the bartender\n> said. \"They all look the same wrapped up in desert clothes.\"\n>\n> As Keedair savored the liquor, a tingle went through his body, not\n> quite euphoria, but a rush of well-being. Then an idea lit his mind.\n> He was a businessman, after all, constantly on the lookout for\n> opportunities. It didn't matter where the merchandise came from.\n>\n> \"And what about this spice beer?\" He tapped his nearly empty glass\n> with a stubby fingernail. \"Where do the Zensunnis find ingredients?\n> Doesn't seem to me that anything could grow out there at all.\"\n>\n> \"Spice is a natural substance in the desert. You can find patches out\n> in the dunes, exposed by the wind or spice blows. But monster\n> sandworms live out there, and fierce storms that'll kill you. Let the\n> Zensunnis have the place, if you ask me. The nomads bring in loads of\n> the stuff to Arrakis City, for bartering.\"\n>\n> Keedair considered taking samples of melange back to the League\n> Worlds. Would there be a market for it on rich Salusa, or among the\n> nobles on Poritrin? The substance certainly had an unusual effect on\n> the body . . .\n>\n> soothing in a way he had never experienced before. If he could sell\n> it, he might offset some of the cost of this exploration trip.\n>\n> The bartender nodded toward the door. \"I don't get enough spice beer\n> that I can sell to you as a middleman, but a band of nomads came in\n> this morning. They'll stay inside their tents during the heat of the\n> day, but you'll find them in the market in the evening, on the east\n> end of the spaceport. They'll sell you whatever they have. Just be\n> sure they don't cheat you.\"\n>\n> \"Nobody cheats me,\" Keedair said, revealing his sharp teeth in a cruel\n> grin.\n>\n> He noticed, though, that his words came out alarmingly slurred.\n>\n> He would have to let the spice beer wear off before he met with the\n> Zensunni.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AWNINGS OF BROWN-AND-WHITE fabric offered patches of shade. The nomads\n> sat by themselves, separated from the bustle of the spaceport. These\n> Zensunnis had constructed tents and shelters from scavenged tarpaulins\n> and cargo wrappings. Some of the fabrics appeared to be made from a\n> different kind of polymer, an odd sort of plastic unlike anything\n> Keedair had seen before.\n>\n> The sun fell behind the barricade of mountains, leaving the sky awash\n> with orange pastels and fire hues. A wind came in as the temperature\n> dropped, bringing dust and stinging sand. The awnings flapped and\n> rattled, but the nomads paid no heed, as if the noise were music to\n> them.\n>\n> Keedair approached them alone, still swaying slightly, though he felt\n> clearer-headed after drinking only water for the rest of the afternoon\n> . . . and paying the exorbitant price. Noticing him, two hopeful women\n> went into their stores to haul out items for sale, spreading them on a\n> flat tabletop. One man stood near them, his lean face tattooed with a\n> geometric symbol, his eyes dark and suspicious.\n>\n> Without saying a word, Keedair allowed the women to display their\n> colorful cloths, along with odd-shaped rocks that had been scoured in\n> sandstorms and a few laughably corroded items of long-forgotten\n> technology that Keedair could never sell to even the most gullible and\n> eccentric antique collector. He shook his head gruffly each time until\n> the lean man--- whom one of the women referred to as Naib Dhartha---\n> said he had nothing else.\n>\n> Keedair got to the point. \"I've tasted spice beer. The man who sold it\n> to me suggested I talk to you.\"\n>\n> \"Spice beer,\" Dhartha said. \"Made from melange. Yes, it is\n> obtainable.\" \"How much can you deliver, and what would it cost me?\"\n>\n> The naib spread his hands and revealed a hint of a smile. \"Everything\n> is open to discussion. The price depends on the amount you desire.\n> Enough for a month of personal use?\"\n>\n> \"Why not a cargo ship full?\" Keedair said, noting shock on the faces\n> of the nomads.\n>\n> Dhartha recovered himself quickly. \"That will take time to gather. A\n> month, maybe two.\"\n>\n> \"I can wait--- if we reach an agreement. I've come here with an empty\n> vessel. I need to take something back with me.\" He looked down at the\n> scavenged objects and the wind-scoured art rocks. \"And I certainly\n> don't want to carry anything like *that*. I'd be the laughingstock of\n> the League.\"\n>\n> Despite a natural Tlulaxa interest in biological products, Keedair was\n> not wedded to the business of slavery. He would go his own way and\n> never return to the Thalim solar system, if necessary. Many of the\n> Tlulaxa were religious fanatics anyway, and he grew tired of their\n> dogma and politics. Drugs and drink would always be in demand, and if\n> he could introduce something new and exotic, a drug the richest nobles\n> had never tried, he might turn a handy profit.\n>\n> \"But first tell me exactly what melange is,\" Keedair continued. \"Where\n> does it come from?\"\n>\n> Dhartha gestured to one of the women, who ducked under the sheltered\n> overhang. A hot breeze picked up, and the polymer fabric flapped\n> louder than before. The sun had settled toward the horizon, forcing\n> him to squint as he looked in that direction. This prevented him from\n> reading nuances in the desert man's expression.\n>\n> Within moments, the woman brought out small, steaming cups of a rich\n> black liquid that smelled of pungent cinnamon spice. She served\n> Keedair first, and he looked down, curious but skeptical.\n>\n> \"Coffee mixed with pure melange,\" Dhartha said. \"You will enjoy it.\"\n>\n> Keedair recalled how expensive water had been in the bar and decided\n> that this nomad was investing in their conversation. He took a sip,\n> cautious at first, but could think of no reason why the fellow might\n> poison him. He tasted the hot coffee on his tongue and felt an\n> electric sensation, a delicious taste that reminded him of the spice\n> beer he still had in his system. He would need to be careful, or he\n> would lose his business edge.\n>\n> \"We harvest melange out in the Tanzerouft, the deep desert where the\n> demon sandworms go. It is very dangerous there. We lose many of our\n> people, but the spice is precious.\"\n>\n> Keedair took another drink of coffee and had to stop himself from\n> agreeing too readily. His assessment of the possibilities grew. Now,\n> as the two men shifted positions, Keedair could look upon Dhartha's\n> lean face. The Naib's eyes were not just dark; they were deep blue.\n> Even the whites had taken on a strange indigo tinge. Most odd. He\n> wondered if it could be an unusual defect caused by Zensunni\n> inbreeding.\n>\n> The desert man reached into one of his pockets and withdrew a small\n> box, which he opened to display a compressed, flaky brown powder. He\n> extended it toward Keedair, who stirred the contents with the tip of\n> his little finger.\n>\n> \"Pure melange. Very potent. We use it in our beverages and meals back\n> in the cave villages.\"\n>\n> Keedair touched the spice-speckled tip of his finger to his tongue.\n> The melange was strong and exhilarating, yet soothing. He felt\n> energetic and calm at the same time. His mind seemed sharper, not\n> fuzzed the way excessive alcohol or drugs affected him. But he held\n> back, not wishing to appear overly anxious.\n>\n> \"And if you consume melange over a long period of time,\" Dhartha was\n> saying, \"it helps you retain your health, keeps you young.\"\n>\n> Keedair made no comment. He had heard similar claims about various\n> \"fountain of youth\" substances. None of them, in his experience, had\n> ever proven effective.\n>\n> He snicked shut the cover of the small box and put it in his own\n> pocket, though it had not been offered to him as a gift. He stood. \"I\n> will come back tomorrow. Then we shall talk more. I need to consider\n> this matter.\"\n>\n> The desert naib grunted in affirmation.\n>\n> Keedair walked toward his shuttle within the parking perimeter of the\n> spaceport. His mind spun with preliminary calculations. His fellow\n> slavers would be disappointed at not even attempting a raid, but\n> Keedair would pay them the minimum required by contract. He needed to\n> ponder the possibilities of this potent spice before discussing a\n> price with the nomads. Arrakis was far, far from normal space trading\n> routes. The idea excited him, but he wasn't certain he could\n> profitably export the exotic substance.\n>\n> Realistically, he doubted if melange would ever be more than a mere\n> curiosity.\n>\n> *Humans are survivors.

He had\n> furnished this room for his business meetings with drug prospectors,\n> biochemists, and pharmaceutical merchants, but Zufa Cenva sometimes\n> used it for her own private meetings.\n>\n> Even in the late darkness, the chief Sorceress was out in the\n> dangerous jungles, training her young prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and preparing them for\n> suicide attacks. Venport did not know whether Zufa was eager or afraid\n> for her volunteers to be called again.\n>\n> He very much hoped his mate didn't get ideas of her own, though she\n> would probably love to make herself a martyr. Zufa took him for\n> granted, blamed him for his imagined failings, but still Venport cared\n> for the cold, pale Sorceress. He didn't want to lose her.\n>\n> Zufa had been due back more than an hour ago, and he'd been waiting\n> for her. It did him no good to be impatient, though. The haughty\n> Sorceress operated on her own schedule, considering his priorities\n> unimportant.\n>\n> Even in the darkest night, the cave room was illuminated by warm,\n> comforting light--- a glowing yellow sphere that floated gracefully\n> above the table like a portable, personal sun. Dear Norma had sent it\n> to him from Poritrin as a gift, a compact light source levitated by a\n> new suspensor field she had developed. Based on the same principle as\n> a glowpanel, but much more efficient, the device generated\n> illumination as a by-product of the suspensor field itself. Norma\n> called it a glowglobe, and he'd been considering its commercial\n> possibilities.\n>\n> Venport took a long drink of bitter herbal ale from a goblet in front\n> of him. He grimaced, then drank some more, trying to bolster his\n> nerve. Zufa should be here any minute, and he was anxious to see her.\n> Out in the jungles the Sorceresses had erected a shrine to honor\n> fallen Heoma. Maybe they were all there now, dancing around it under\n> the starlight, chanting incantations like witches. Or maybe--- despite\n> their cool, agnostic logic and determination--- they chose private\n> moments to worship a Gaia life force, an Earth mother that embodied\n> feminine power. Anything to set them apart from what they considered\n> to be \"weakling\" men . . .\n>\n> Beckoned by the glowglobe, nightbugs flew into the room from the outer\n> corridors. The nocturnal insects had a voracious appetite for human\n> blood, but only men were bothered. It was one of the jokes of Rossak,\n> as if the Sorceresses had cast some sort of a spell on the tiny\n> creatures to keep their men inside during the evenings, while women\n> performed secret rites out in the jungles.\n>\n> Another quarter of an hour passed, and still Zufa did not join him.\n> Frustrated with her, Venport finished the ale and set the empty goblet\n> on the opalwood table, heaving a disgusted sigh. He rarely asked to\n> see her, but this was important to him. Couldn't she give him just a\n> few moments of her precious time?\n>\n> Still, he would continue to seek her understanding and respect. For\n> years, Venport had enjoyed substantial success in exporting medical\n> narcotics and pharmaceuticals manufactured from Rossak plants. In the\n> past month, his men had turned a large profit from the sale of\n> psychedelics to Yardin. The drugs had become a favorite of the\n> Buddislamic mystics who ran the place. The mystics used the Rossak\n> hallucinogen in religious rituals, attempting to attain enlightenment.\n>\n> Venport stared at a large, milky soostone on the table. A smuggler\n> from Buzzell, one of the Unallied Planets, had sold him the extremely\n> rare and valuable stone. The dealer had claimed that some soostones of\n> extraordinary purity possessed hypnotic focusing abilities. He wanted\n> Zufa\n>\n> to wear it with pride, perhaps on a pendant. The Sorceress could use\n> it to make herself stronger.\n>\n> He inserted a rolled slip of alkaloid bark into his mouth and crunched\n> down, knowing it would make him relax. He dimmed the glowglobe and\n> adjusted its spectrum to a more orange light, which caused the\n> soostone to dance with rainbow colors. The alkaloid bark made him feel\n> tingly, calm . . . and distant. The uncommon stone shimmered\n> hypnotically, and he lost track of time.\n>\n> When Zufa entered the room, her pale face was flushed, her eyes\n> bright. She looked like an ethereal creature in the room's rich glow.\n> She wore a long diaphanous gown with tiny jewels sparkling across it\n> like a field of ruby flowers.\n>\n> \"I see you have nothing important to do,\" she said, already frowning.\n>\n> He gathered his wits about him. \"Nothing more important than waiting\n> for you.\" Rising to his feet with all the pride he could muster, he\n> picked up the soostone. \"I found this, and I thought of you. A gift\n> from Buzzell, where my merchants made an extraordinary profit from---\"\n> Noticing an expression of disdain on her face, Venport felt flustered.\n> His voice trailed off.\n>\n> \"And what am I supposed to do with it?\" She examined the offering,\n> without touching it. \"When have I ever cared for pretty baubles?\"\n>\n> \"It's a rare soostone, said to have certain . . . telepathic\n> enhancement characteristics. Perhaps you can use it as a focusing\n> device when you instruct your trainees?\" She stood like a statue,\n> unimpressed, and he continued in a rush, \"The Buddislamics on Yardin\n> are clamoring for our psychedelics. I've made a lot of credits in the\n> past few months, and I thought this was something you might\n> appreciate.\"\n>\n> \"I'm tired and I'm going to bed,\" she said, letting him keep the\n> present. \"My Sorceresses have already proven their abilities. With\n> machines still threatening every League world, we don't have time to\n> stare into soostones.\"\n>\n> He shook his head. What would it have cost her merely to accept his\n> gift? Could she not at least have offered him a word of kindness? Hurt\n> so deeply that even the calming bark could not soothe him, Venport\n> shouted, \"If we give up our humanity to fight the machines, Zufa, then\n> Omnius has already won!\"\n>\n> She hesitated just a moment, but did not turn back to him. Instead,\n> she went to her chambers and left him standing alone.\n>\n> *In surviving, shall our humanity endure?

In a drizzle of summer rain, Vorian rode inside an\n> exquisite white coach, drawn by four prancing white stallions. Erasmus\n> had ordered the robot coachman to wear a uniform with broad military\n> lapels, dripping golden ribbons and a tricorner hat taken from an\n> ancient historical image.\n>\n> The extravagance was inefficient and unnecessary--- not to mention\n> anachronistic--- but the human trustee had heard that eccentric\n> Erasmus often did inexplicable things. Vor could not imagine why such\n> an important representative of the evermind would want to see *him*.\n>\n> Perhaps Erasmus had studied some of the simulations and war games\n> Vorian had played with Seurat. He knew that the robot had built\n> extensive laboratories to research the questions about human nature\n> that plagued his inquisitive mind. *But what could I possibly tell\n> him?*\n>\n> As the carriage wheels clattered over cobblestones in front of the\n> manor house, Vor wiped fog from the window. Even in the rain, the\n> imposing Grogyptian-style villa was more magnificent than the\n> efficient grid-organized cities. It seemed fit for a prince.\n>\n> With ornamental gardens and enough tile-roofed buildings to comprise a\n> small village, the sprawling estate covered many acres. The\n> balcony-adorned main house featured tall fluted columns and winged\n> gargoyles that looked down on a reception plaza as large as a town\n> square crowded with\n>\n> fountains and twisted sculptures, paved gathering areas and\n> stone-walled outbuildings.\n>\n> *What am I doing here?*\n>\n> Two liveried humans approached, averting their eyes as if Vor was a\n> visiting machine dignitary. One man opened the door, while the other\n> helped him step down. \"Erasmus waits to see you.\" The white horses\n> pranced and fidgeted, perhaps because they received few opportunities\n> to exercise.\n>\n> One of the liveried men held a rain cover to shield Vor's dark hair\n> from the drizzle. Dressed in a sleeveless tunic and light trousers, he\n> shivered. He hated being drenched, and the discomfort only reminded\n> him of the flaws and weaknesses of his human body. If he were a cymek,\n> he could have easily adjusted his internal temperature, and\n> thoughtrodes could delete annoying sensual responses. *Someday*.\n>\n> Inside the entry, a beautiful young woman greeted him. \"Vorian\n> Atreides?\" She had exotic lavender eyes and a flashing independence in\n> contrast to the cowed men in livery. The barest hint of a challenging\n> smile curved her lips. \"So, you are the son of the evil Agamemnon?\"\n>\n> Taken aback, Vor drew himself up. \"My father is a revered general,\n> first among the Titans. His military exploits are legendary.\"\n>\n> \"Or infamous.\" The woman stared at him with a shocking lack of\n> respect.\n>\n> Vor didn't know how to react. Lower-caste humans on the Synchronized\n> Worlds all knew their places, and she couldn't be a trustee, like\n> himself. No other slave had ever spoken to him in such a manner. As a\n> reward after his numerous update missions, Vor had been granted the\n> services of pleasure slaves, women assigned to warm his bed. He had\n> never asked any of them their identities. \"I want to know your name\n> because I wish to remember it,\" he said, at last. He found something\n> intriguing about this exotically beautiful woman and her unexpected\n> defiance.\n>\n> She sounded as proud of her lineage as Vor was. \"I am Serena Butler.\"\n> She led him along a corridor lined with statuary and paintings, then\n> into a botanical garden shielded from the rain by a glass-paneled\n> ceiling.\n>\n> \"What do you do here? Are you one of Erasmus's . . . privileged\n> trainees?\"\n>\n> \"I am just a house slave, but unlike you, I don't serve the thinking\n> machines by choice.\"\n>\n> He took her comment as a badge of honor. \"Yes, I serve them and\n> proudly. I am helping to achieve the best that is possible for our\n> flawed species.\"\n>\n> \"By collaborating with Omnius, you are a willing traitor to your race.\n> To the free humans, you are as evil as your machine masters. Or hasn't\n> that ever occurred to you before?\"\n>\n> Vor was baffled. The human military commander at Giedi Prime had made\n> similar accusations. \"Evil . . . in what way? Can't you see the good\n> that Omnius has accomplished? It's so obvious. Simply look at the\n> Synchronized Worlds. Every detail is seen to, everything runs\n> smoothly. Why would anyone want to disrupt that?\"\n>\n> Serena gazed at him, as if trying to decide whether he truly meant\n> what he said. Finally, she shook her head. \"You are a fool, a slave\n> who cannot see his chains. It's not worth the effort to convince you.\"\n> Abruptly she turned away from him and marched ahead, leaving him\n> speechless. \"For all your supposed training, you simply don't know any\n> better.\"\n>\n> Before he could think of a suitable response, Vor noticed the\n> independent robot. Garbed in opulent robes, Erasmus stood by a shallow\n> pool, his oval face reflecting the water. Raindrops fell from an\n> opening cut through the glass ceiling, wetting him. Classical music\n> played a soothing melody in the background.\n>\n> Without announcing Vor's arrival, Serena left. Surprised by her\n> rudeness, he stared after her. He admired her face and amber-brown\n> hair, as well as her bearing and obvious intelligence. Her waist was\n> thick, and he wondered if\n>\n> she was pregnant. Paradoxically, her arrogance made her more\n> captivating, the desirability of something unattainable.\n>\n> Obviously, Serena Butler had not accepted her place as a household\n> servant. Considering the squalid lives of slaves in the unkempt pens\n> behind the villa, what did she have to complain about? It made no\n> sense.\n>\n> \"Outspoken, is she not?\" said Erasmus, still standing in the rain. The\n> robot shifted his pliable face into a congenial smile.\n>\n> Standing away from the cool drizzle, Vor said, \"I am surprised you\n> tolerate her annoying attitude.\"\n>\n> \"Attitudes can be enlightening.\" Erasmus turned back to his study of\n> the raindrops in the reflecting pool. \"I find her interesting.\n> Refreshingly honest\n>\n> --- much as you are.\" The robot took a step toward him. \"I have\n> reached an impasse in my study of human behavior because most of my\n> subjects are drawn from docile captives who have been bred to slavery.\n> They have never known any life but one of service and subjugation, and\n> do not show any *spark*. They are sheep, while you, Vorian Atreides,\n> are a wolf. And so is this Serena Butler . . . in her own way.\"\n>\n> The visitor bowed, swelling with pride. \"I am happy to assist you in\n> any manner, Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \"I trust you enjoyed the coach ride? I breed the stallions and keep\n> them groomed for important occasions. You gave me an excuse to use\n> them.\"\n>\n> \"It was an unusual experience,\" Vor admitted. \"A most . . . archaic\n> mode of transportation.\"\n>\n> \"Come stand here in the rain with me.\" Erasmus beckoned with a\n> synthetic hand. \"It is pleasant, I assure you.\"\n>\n> Vor stepped forward as he was told, trying not to show discomfort. The\n> rain quickly soaked his tunic, moistened his bare arms; water trickled\n> from his\n>\n> clumped dark hair, down his forehead and into his eyes. \"Yes, Erasmus.\n> It's . . . pleasant.\"\n>\n> The robot simulated a laugh. \"You are lying.\"\n>\n> With good humor, Vor said, \"It is what humans do best.\"\n>\n> Mercifully, the robot led them out of the rain. \"Let us discuss\n> Serena. She is attractive, according to human standards of beauty, is\n> she not?\" Vor didn't know what to say, but Erasmus pressed him, \"I\n> watched you with her. You would like to procreate with that feral\n> human, would you not? She is currently carrying the child of a\n> *hrethgir* lover, but we will have plenty of time. She is unlike any\n> simple pleasure slave you have been assigned?\"\n>\n> Vor pondered the questions, wondering what the robot really wanted to\n> know. \"Well, she is beautiful . . . and enticing.\"\n>\n> Erasmus made an artificial sound, something like a sigh. \"Sadly,\n> despite my numerous sensitive upgrades, I remain unable to experience\n> sexual activity, at least not in the way a biological male does. I\n> have spent centuries designing upgrades and modifications that might\n> replicate the sensations of ecstasy that even the lowliest human can\n> enjoy. Thus far, there has been little progress. My attempts with\n> female slaves have been alarmingly unsuccessful.\"\n>\n> Strolling along in his fine clothes, Erasmus gestured for Vor to\n> follow him through the greenhouse. As they walked down garden paths,\n> the regal machine identified various plants by name and origin, as if\n> he were lecturing a child or bragging about his knowledge. \"Serena\n> knows a great deal about plants herself. She was something of a\n> horticulturist on Salusa Secundus.\"\n>\n> Vor made polite responses, trying to guess how he could help the\n> robot. He wiped water from his eyes; his damp clothes felt clammy and\n> unpleasant.\n>\n> Finally Erasmus explained why he had summoned the young trustee.\n> \"Vorian Atreides, your father recently gave you a biological\n> life-extension\n>\n> treatment.\" The mechanical face shifted back to a smooth mirror, so as\n> not to give Vor a clue about what he wanted. \"Tell me, how do you\n> *feel* now that you have had centuries added to your lifespan? Surely,\n> it is a great gift from Agamemnon, as significant as his original\n> sperm donation.\"\n>\n> Before Vor could consider the question, Serena entered the greenhouse\n> carrying a silver tea set. She placed the tray with a rough clatter on\n> a polished stone table and poured dark liquid into two cups. She\n> handed one to Vor and one to the robot. Erasmus extruded a fibrous,\n> feathery-tipped probe into the tea, as if tasting it. His mirrored\n> mask shifted into an expression of supreme pleasure. \"Excellent,\n> Serena. A remarkable and interesting flavor!\"\n>\n> Vor did not care for the taste himself; the tea reminded him of bitter\n> chocolate mixed with spoiled fruit juices. Serena seemed amused at his\n> expression.\n>\n> \"It is good?\" Erasmus asked. \"Serena prepared it especially for you. I\n> let her choose an appropriate recipe.\"\n>\n> \"The flavor is . . . unique.\"\n>\n> The robot laughed. \"You are lying again.\"\n>\n> \"No, Erasmus. I am avoiding a direct response.\"\n>\n> Vor saw hostility in Serena's unusual eyes as she looked at him, and\n> he wondered if she had ruined the tea on purpose. Leaving the tray on\n> the stone table, she departed, saying, \"Maybe I should attend a\n> trustee school to learn how to be a better simpering servant.\"\n>\n> Vor watched Serena, surprised that Erasmus ignored her rudeness. \"It\n> amuses me to watch her attempts at resistance, Vorian. Harmless\n> defiance. She knows she can never escape.\" During a moment of silence,\n> the robot continued to study him. \"You did not answer my question\n> about the life extension.\"\n>\n> Now that he'd had time to ponder, Vor said, \"Honestly, I'm not sure\n> how I feel about it. My human body is fragile, easily damaged. Though\n> I am still prone to accidents or sickness, at least I will not grow\n> old and weak.\" Vor thought about all the years remaining to him, like\n> credits to spend. He would live several human lifespans, but becoming\n> a cymek would be so much more important. \"Even so, my extra years are\n> only the blink of an eye compared to the life of a thinking machine\n> such as yourself.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, the blink of an eye, an involuntary human reflex I can\n> understand physically and conceptually. You use it as an inexact\n> metaphor to indicate a brief period of time.\"\n>\n> Noticing watcheye screens on the greenhouse walls, Vor realized that\n> the evermind must be eavesdropping. \"Are you always this curious?\"\n>\n> \"Curiosity is how one learns,\" Erasmus said. \"I inquire because I am\n> inquisitive. That makes sense, does it not? Enlighten me. I would like\n> to speak with you again. You--- and Serena--- can give me an\n> interesting perspective.\"\n>\n> Vor bowed. \"As you wish, Erasmus. However, I must coordinate such\n> visits with my important work for Omnius. Soon the *Dream Voyager*\n> will be repaired and ready to depart on another update run.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, we all work for Omnius.\" Erasmus paused. Overhead, through the\n> murky ceiling of the greenhouse, the rain had stopped, leaving patchy\n> openings of blue sky. \"Think more about mortality and longevity. Come\n> and speak to me again before departing on your next voyage.\"\n>\n> \"I will seek permission to do so, Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> INTRIGUED BY THE fascinating interplay between the two humans, Erasmus\n> summoned Serena again and commanded her to escort their guest back to\n> his coach. She had been outwardly hostile to this son of Agamemnon,\n> while he was clearly interested in her . . . physically? . . .\n>\n> mentally? And how could one tell the difference? Another experiment,\n> perhaps?\n>\n> Even though they had exchanged few words, Vorian found his imagination\n> filled with this young woman. He had never met a female like her, with\n> such self-confident beauty, intelligence, and willingness to speak her\n> mind. Obviously Serena Butler had been raised to value herself as an\n> individual--- much as Erasmus worked hard to perfect his own\n> independence.\n>\n> Reaching the outer doorway of the villa, the young man blurted, \"When\n> is your baby due?\" At the coach, the horses seemed anxious to be off.\n> The uniformed robot driver sat like a statue.\n>\n> Serena's eyes widened with annoyance. She was about to retort that it\n> was none of his business, but she stopped short. Perhaps Vorian\n> Atreides was just the opportunity she had been hoping for. He had\n> information that might help her escape, and he had the trust of the\n> machines. It would be foolish to alienate him from the outset. If she\n> befriended him instead, might she not be able to show him what a free\n> human being could be?\n>\n> She drew a deep breath and smiled uncertainly. \"I'm not prepared to\n> discuss my baby with a complete stranger. But maybe next time you\n> come, we could talk. That might be a place to start.\" There. She had\n> done it.\n>\n> With that, she went inside the villa and carefully shut the door\n> behind her.\n>\n> As she watched the coach from the portico of the towering villa,\n> Serena Butler felt uncertain and confused about this deluded man who\n> so proudly served the machines. She didn't like him, wasn't sure she\n> could ever trust him. But perhaps he could be helpful.\n>\n> Feeling uneasy, and damp from the rain and mist in the outside air,\n> she hurried back inside to dry herself and change her clothes. With\n> the precious baby growing inside her womb, six months along now, she\n> thought of her beloved Xavier. Could Vorian help her return to him, or\n> would her child grow up in captivity, never to know its father?\n\n> *Of all the subjects of human behavior, two are most storied: warfare\n> and love.*\n>\n> --- COGITOR EKLO,\n>\n> *Ruminations on Things Lost*\n>\n> **T**he tragic loss of Serena had left Xavier off course, struggling\n> to regain the momentum of his life. Three months earlier, he had seen\n> the wreckage of her blockade runner floating in the seas of Giedi\n> Prime, and had read the indisputable DNA analysis of the blood samples\n> found inside.\n>\n> He did not claim to understand his feelings, and avoided them by\n> letting his work consume him. At first he had wanted to fling himself\n> recklessly at another machine stronghold, but Serena would have\n> scolded him for that. The thought of her disapproval was the only\n> thing that had stopped him.\n>\n> She had died fighting the inhuman enemy. Xavier needed an anchor to\n> grasp, some form of stability before moving on. For the sake of her\n> memory, the struggle must continue until every thinking machine had\n> been destroyed.\n>\n> Xavier's mind drifted to Octa, the haunting reminder of her sister.\n> Lovely in her own right, she was sensitive and introspective, rather\n> than the goal-driven crusader Serena had been. Still, in subtle ways,\n> the willowy girl reminded him achingly of Serena, in the shape of her\n> mouth and the gentle smile. It was like the echo of a pleasant memory.\n> Xavier found himself torn between staring longingly at Octa and\n> avoiding her entirely.\n>\n> She was there to comfort him when he grieved, gave him space when he\n> needed it, and cheered him when he wanted that. Quietly and gently,\n> Octa was filling a void in his life. Although their relationship\n> remained tranquil and unremarkable, she showed him attentive love.\n> Where Serena had been a storm of emotions, her sister was steady and\n> predictable.\n>\n> One day, on an impulse driven more by grief and longing than common\n> sense, Xavier asked Octa to become his wife. She had looked at him\n> with wide eyes, astonished. \"I am afraid to move, Xavier, to utter a\n> sound, because I must be dreaming.\"\n>\n> He had worn his clean and pressed Armada uniform bearing his new rank\n> insignia as Segundo. Xavier stood straight, his hands clasped, as if\n> addressing a superior officer, rather than asking Octa to join him as\n> his life mate. He had always known that Serena's sister had a girlish,\n> unrealistic infatuation with him, and now he hoped it could grow into\n> genuine love.\n>\n> \"In choosing you to marry me, dear Octa, I can think of no braver way\n> to march forward into the future. It is our best chance to honor\n> Serena's memory.\"\n>\n> The words sounded like a formal speech, but Octa flushed as if they\n> were a magical incantation. Aware that this was the wrong reason to\n> betroth himself to her, Xavier tried to dispel the uneasiness. He had\n> made up his mind and hoped that they could soothe each others' wounds.\n>\n> Both Manion and Livia Butler accepted and encouraged the shifting of\n> Xavier's affections; they even rushed the nuptials. Now the bridge\n> across an emotional chasm had been severed, and they believed the\n> match with Octa would benefit all of them.\n>\n> On the day of his wedding, Xavier searched for an inner peace, doing\n> his best to lock away the portion of his heart that would always\n> belong to Serena. He still longed for the peal of her laugh, for her\n> outspokenness, for the electric touch of her skin. Taking a few\n> private moments, he reviewed his favorite memories of her one by one\n> in his mind, and then, tearfully, set them aside.\n>\n> From now on, gentle Octa would be his wife. He would not hurt the\n> already-fragile girl by wallowing in regrets, or by comparing her to\n> her sister. That would be dishonest and unfair to her.\n>\n> A number of League representatives had gathered at the hilltop Butler\n> estate, where seven months earlier Xavier and Serena had participated\n> in the raucous bristleback hunt. Nearby, in the courtyard, they had\n> held the gala betrothal celebration filled with music and dancing---\n> but ending with the terrible news of Giedi Prime's fall.\n>\n> At Xavier's insistence, the wedding took place inside a new pavilion\n> with vistas of vineyards and olive groves. The fabric structure was so\n> resplendent and intricate in its workmanship that it cost more than a\n> modest house. Out in front, three large banners fluttered in a gentle\n> breeze, designating the households of Butler and Harkonnen, and of\n> Tantor, Xavier's adoptive family. In the valley below, the white\n> buildings of Zimia shone in sunlight, with wide avenues and large\n> administration complexes refurbished in the fourteen months since the\n> cymek attack.\n>\n> The ceremony was small and somber, despite the guests' pretenses and\n> Manion Butler's insistent merriment. New memories would supplant the\n> old ones. Smiling as he had not done in months, the Viceroy strutted\n> from guest to guest under the colorful awnings, tasting punch recipes\n> and sampling the cornucopia of cheeses and wines.\n>\n> The silent bride and groom stood by a small altar at the front of the\n> crowded tent, holding hands. Dressed in the pale-blue gown of\n> traditional Salusan weddings, Octa looked ethereal, lovely and fragile\n> beside him. Her strawberry-blond hair was held neatly in place with\n> pearl-head pins.\n>\n> Some would say this rushed marriage to Serena's sister was a reaction\n> to Xavier's grief, but he knew he was taking the honorable course. He\n> reminded himself a thousand times that Serena would have approved.\n> Together, he and Octa would bring closure to so much pain and sadness.\n>\n> Inside the flower-decked pavilion stood Abbess Livia Butler, her\n> amber-brown hair highlighted by sparkling golden strands. She had come\n> from the City of Introspection to perform the ceremony. Confident and\n> proud, as if she had purged all doubts and sorrow from her mind, Livia\n> looked at the bride and groom, then smiled at her husband. Manion\n> Butler barely fit into\n>\n> his red and gold tuxedo. Soft flesh poked out at the neck and at the\n> ends of the sleeves.\n>\n> A group of players began to strum their balisets. A boy with a sweet\n> tenor voice sang slowly. Beside Xavier, Octa seemed to be in her own\n> dreamy world, not quite certain how to react to the turn of\n> circumstances. She squeezed his hand, and he raised it to his lips and\n> kissed it.\n>\n> Ever since the death of her twin brother Fredo, Octa had developed an\n> ability to shut things out, never overwhelming herself with\n> large-scale concerns but instead preferring smaller tableaux. Such a\n> limited focus might permit her to be happy, and Xavier, too.\n>\n> Tears glistening in his expressive eyes, Viceroy Butler stepped\n> forward to clasp their hands. After a long moment he turned solemnly\n> to his wife, and nodded. Abbess Livia began to intone the ceremony.\n> \"We are here to sing a song of love, a song that has joined men and\n> women since the earliest days of civilization.\"\n>\n> As Octa smiled up at Xavier, he could almost imagine she was Serena,\n> but he drove the troubling image away. He and Octa loved each other in\n> a different way. Their bond grew stronger each time he held her in his\n> arms. Xavier had only to accept the warmth that she readily bestowed\n> on him.\n>\n> Before them, Livia spoke the traditional words, the roots of which\n> extended back to the Panchristian and Buddislamic texts of ancient\n> times. The lilting phrases were beautiful, and Xavier's mind kept\n> expanding outward, thinking forward and backward. The words were\n> infinitely calm and reassuring as Abbess Livia guided the young couple\n> through their vows.\n>\n> Soon everything necessary had been said. As he shared the ritual of\n> love and placed a ring on Octa's finger, Xavier Harkonnen pledged his\n> eternal devotion to her. Not even the thinking machines could tear\n> this relationship apart.\n>\n> *Talk is based on the assumption that you can get somewhere if you\n> keep puttingone word after another.*\n\n--- IBLIS GINJO,\n\nnotes in the margin of a stolen notebook\n\n> **A**jax strode his intimidating walker-form into the Forum Plaza,\n> inspecting every operation, searching for flaws. With his array of\n> optic threads, the Titan scanned the polished colossus that showed his\n> long-forgotten human form. Ajax was frustrated that Iblis Ginjo had\n> maintained such a careful watch that he could find no excuse to impose\n> amusing punishments. . . .\n>\n> In turmoil, Iblis watched for an opportunity of his own. His\n> imagination kept returning to the remarkable things he had learned\n> from the Cogitor Eklo, especially details of the glorious failure of\n> the Hrethgir Rebellions. Ajax personified the brutality and pain of\n> those long-ago battles.\n>\n> Could the Cogitor help Iblis to spread the quiet fires of a brewing\n> revolution? They could learn from the mistakes of the past attempts.\n> Had there ever been a rebel of trustee stature, like Iblis? And how\n> could the secondary Aquim assist him?\n>\n> Despite his subtle investigations, his ability to manipulate\n> conversations and make others unwittingly divulge their secrets, Iblis\n> had not yet found evidence of other resistance groups. Perhaps their\n> leadership was scattered, disorganized, weak. Who had sent him the\n> secret messages--- five in the past three months?\n>\n> The lack of evidence frustrated Iblis, because he wanted to push the\n> uprising forward, now that he had made up his mind. On the other hand,\n> if the dissenters were too easily found, they would have no chance\n> against the organized thinking machines.\n>\n> After pushing his slaves particularly hard and finishing his assigned\n> labors, Iblis asked to take another pilgrimage to Eklo's stone tower.\n> Only the\n>\n> Cogitor could give him the answers he needed. When he spoke with the\n> administrative cymek Dante, showing records that demonstrated his\n> productivity and efficiency, the Titan bureaucrat granted him\n> permission to leave the city grid. Dante made it clear, however, that\n> he didn't understand why a mere work supervisor would be interested in\n> nonproductive philosophical issues. It seemed to go beyond the\n> interests of most trustees. \"It will not benefit you.\"\n>\n> \"I'm sure you are right, Lord Dante . . . but it amuses me.\"\n>\n> Setting out before dawn, Iblis urged the smelly burrhorse into the\n> rocky desert and up the slopes to the monastery. Aquim awaited him at\n> the steep circular stairs to the tower, again looking disheveled and\n> somewhat dazed from semuta. From the first time Iblis had immersed his\n> hand in electrafluid and touched the Cogitor's thoughts, he could not\n> imagine why Aquim wanted to dull his perceptions. Perhaps the complex\n> enlightened thoughts of Eklo were so vast and overwhelming that the\n> big-shouldered secondary needed to dampen the flood of confusing\n> revelations.\n>\n> \"I see you look at me with disapproval,\" Aquim said, peering out\n> through slitted eyelids.\n>\n> \"Oh no,\" Iblis said. Then, realizing he could not get away with lying,\n> he said, \"I was just noticing that you enjoy your semuta.\"\n>\n> The big man smiled and spoke in a voice that slurred slightly. \"To an\n> outsider, it may appear that I have deadened my senses, but semuta\n> permits me to forget my own destructive past, before I was inspired to\n> join Cogitor Eklo. It also enables me to focus on what is really\n> important, ignoring the sensual distractions of the flesh.\"\n>\n> \"I can't picture you as a destructive man.\"\n>\n> \"Oh, but I was. My father fought against enslavement and died in the\n> attempt. Afterward, I sought revenge against the machines, and I was\n> good at it. I led a small band of men, and we . . . damaged some\n> robots. I am sorry to say that we also killed a number of trustee\n> slaves who got in our\n>\n> way, men such as yourself. Then Eklo arranged for my rescue, and for\n> my rehabilitation of sorts. He never told me why he sought me out, or\n> how he made the arrangements. There are many things the Cogitor does\n> not reveal to anyone, not even to me.\"\n>\n> Abruptly, the monk turned and plodded unsteadily up the stairs,\n> leading Iblis to the chamber where the Cogitor lived in a state of\n> eternal contemplation. Standing in the tower room with the\n> color-bathed observation windows, Aquim said, \"Eklo has considered\n> your situation at length. Long ago he watched the changes in humanity\n> after the Titans crushed the Old Empire, but he did nothing. Eklo\n> thought the challenge and adversity would improve the human race by\n> strengthening their minds, forcing them out of their sleepwalking\n> existence.\"\n>\n> The monk wiped a stain from the corner of his mouth. \"By separating\n> their minds from their bodies, the cymek Titans could have become\n> enlightened, like Cogitors. That was Eklo's hope when he assisted\n> Juno. But the Titans never rose above their animal flaws. This\n> weakness enabled Omnius to conquer them, and humanity.\" Aquim stepped\n> toward the translucent brain canister resting on a window shelf. \"Eklo\n> believes you may be able to institute a change.\"\n>\n> Iblis's heart leaped. \"Nothing is impossible.\" But he knew he could\n> not fight the machines by himself, would need to find others to help\n> him. *Many others.*\n>\n> Before the transparent window, Eklo's plexiplaz container glistened in\n> a wash of golden morning sunlight. In the distance, Iblis could see\n> the unending skyline of megaliths and monuments designed by the cymeks\n> and built with human sweat and blood. *Do I really want to see them\n> all crumble to dust?*\n>\n> The crew boss hesitated as he considered the consequences, remembering\n> the billions of victims of the Hrethgir Rebellions on Walgis and other\n> worlds. Then he sensed an intrusion into his thoughts, something\n> bumping against them.\n>\n> Aquim removed the covering of the Cogitor's canister, exposing the\n> nutrient fluid that supported the ancient mind. \"Come, Eklo wishes to\n> make direct contact with you.\"\n>\n> The tank's nutrient solution was like amniotic fluid, tingling with\n> immeasurable mental energy. Tentative, fighting his eagerness to know\n> and learn, Iblis dipped his fingers into the electrafluid, touching\n> the slippery surface of Eklo's brain and unlocking all the thoughts\n> the Cogitor wanted to give him.\n>\n> Aquim stood to one side with a strange expression on his face, part\n> beatific complacence, part envy.\n>\n> \"Neutrality is a delicate balancing act,\" Eklo said directly into\n> Iblis's mind, through the neurelectric contact promulgated by the\n> organic circuitry. \"Long ago, I answered Juno's many questions about\n> how to overthrow the Old Empire. My unbiased answers and advice\n> allowed the Titans to formulate successful plans, and the course of\n> the human race was forever changed. For many centuries I reconsidered\n> what I did.\" The brain seemed to press against Iblis's fingertips. \"It\n> is essential for all Cogitors to maintain absolute neutrality. We must\n> be objective.\"\n>\n> Puzzled, Iblis said, \"Then why are you speaking to me? Why have you\n> raised the possibility that the machines might be overthrown?\"\n>\n> \"In order to reestablish the balance of neutrality,\" Eklo said. \"Once,\n> I inadvertently assisted the Titans, so I must now answer your\n> questions with the same objectivity. In the final analysis, I will\n> have maintained equilibrium.\"\n>\n> Iblis swallowed hard. \"Then you have foreseen where it all ends?\"\n>\n> \"There are endings all around us, and beginnings. You alone can decide\n> where you are on the path.\"\n>\n> As Iblis's thoughts spun, searching for useful questions about machine\n> weaknesses and vulnerabilities, Eklo intruded, \"I cannot provide\n> concrete\n>\n> military or political details, but if you phrase your questions\n> cleverly enough, as Juno did, then you shall have what you need. The\n> art of cleverness is a prime lesson of life. You must outwit the\n> machines, Iblis Ginjo.\"\n>\n> For more than an hour, Eklo guided Iblis. \"I have considered this\n> problem for many centuries, long before you came to me. And if you do\n> not succeed, I shall consider it even longer.\"\n>\n> \"But I can't fail. I must succeed.\"\n>\n> \"It will take more than desire on your part. You must tap into the\n> deepest emotions of the masses.\" Eklo fell silent for several moments.\n>\n> Iblis struggled to comprehend, trying to stretch his thoughts. \"Love,\n> hate, fear? Is that what you mean?\"\n>\n> \"They are components, yes.\"\n>\n> \"Components?\"\n>\n> \"Of religion. The machines are very powerful, and it will take more\n> than a mere political or social uprising to defeat them. The people\n> must coalesce around a powerful idea that goes even deeper, into the\n> very essence of their existence, what it means to be human. You must\n> be more than a trustee, but a visionary leader. Slaves need to rise up\n> in a great holy war against the machines, an unstoppable jihad to\n> overthrow their masters.\"\n>\n> \"A holy war? A jihad? But how can I do that?\"\n>\n> \"I tell you only what I sense, Iblis Ginjo, what I have thought and\n> envisioned. You must go out and discover the rest of the answers for\n> yourself. But know this: Of all human wars in history, a jihad is the\n> most passionate, conquering worlds and civilizations, mowing down\n> everything in its path.\"\n>\n> \"And the people sending me messages--- how do they fit into this?\"\n>\n> \"I know nothing of them,\" Eklo said, \"and I do not see them in any of\n> my visions. Perhaps you have been specially chosen, or it might be\n> nothing but a ruse or a trap by the machines.\" The Cogitor fell\n> silent, then said, \"Now I must ask you to leave, for my mind is tired\n> and I need to rest.\"\n>\n> When Iblis departed from the imposing stone tower, he felt a strange\n> mixture of exhilaration and confusion. He needed to organize the\n> information into a comprehensive plan. Though he was not a holy man or\n> a military person, he did understand how to manipulate groups of\n> people, how to channel their loyalties in order to achieve his goals.\n> Already, his work crews would do almost anything for him. His\n> leadership abilities would be his greatest asset, and weapon. But the\n> scale was not large enough. It needed to be much larger than a few\n> hundred people in order to succeed.\n>\n> And he needed to be very careful, in case the thinking machines were\n> trying to trap him.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WITH ACCESS TO Omnius's watcheyes and distributed surveillance\n> hardware, Erasmus monitored the activities of his experimental\n> subjects. Many loyal trustees had ignored the hints he had sent to\n> them; others had been too frightened to act. But some had shown an\n> amusing amount of initiative.\n>\n> Yes, Erasmus felt that Iblis Ginjo was a perfect candidate to prove\n> his point, and win the bet with Omnius.\n>\n> *\"Systematic\" is a dangerous word, a dangerous concept.

This place was\n> clean, comfortable, and warm . . . far more pleasant than the slave\n> barracks on the muddy river delta.\n>\n> The boy should have counted his blessings.\n>\n> But this unwelcome place was not Harmonthep. He missed his small boat,\n> navigating through rivulets in the tall reeds. He especially missed\n> the evenings, when the Zensunni would gather in the central hut on the\n> highest stilts to tell stories, recite fire poetry, or simply listen\n> to his grandfather read comforting sutras.\n>\n> \"I hate this place,\" Aliid said beside him, speaking loudly enough\n> that he drew a scolding glare from Tio Holtzman himself.\n>\n> \"Perhaps you would rather return to the mudflats or the agricultural\n> fields?\"\n>\n> Aliid frowned at his own outburst, but met the scientist's steady\n> gaze. \"I hated those places too,\" he mumbled, but not by way of\n> apology.\n>\n> All work stopped. All eyes were fixed on him.\n>\n> Holtzman shook his head in disbelief. \"I simply do not understand why\n> you people complain about everything. I feed and clothe you, I give\n> you easy assignments that advance the cause of humanity--- and still\n> you want to crawl back to squalid villages and live in disease and\n> filth.\"\n>\n> The inventor looked genuinely angry. \"Don't you understand that\n> thinking machines are out there trying to crush every living person?\n> Just imagine all the humans they slaughtered on Giedi Prime, and no\n> one could stop them! Omnius doesn't care about your religion or your\n> foolish politics against civilization. If they find your little\n> hovels, they will destroy them, burn them to the ground.\"\n>\n> *Just like the Tlulaxa slavers did to my village*, Ishmael thought. He\n> saw Aliid's dark eyes flash and knew that his friend was thinking the\n> same thing.\n>\n> Holtzman shook his head. \"You fanatics have no sense of\n> responsibility. Luckily, it is my job to force it on you.\" He went\n> back to his scribing board, angrily jabbed his fingers at the symbols.\n> \"Here are segments of equations. I need you to solve them. Simple\n> mathematics. *Try* to go through the steps I showed you.\" His gaze\n> narrowed. \"Each correct answer will earn one full share of daily\n> rations. If you make mistakes, you go hungry.\"\n>\n> With a heavy heart, Ishmael turned to the papers and computational\n> devices before him, doing his best to follow the supposedly simple\n> calculations.\n>\n> On Harmonthep, all the children in the marsh village had received a\n> basic education in mathematics, science, and engineering. The elders\n> felt that such knowledge would be important for them, when their\n> civilization rose again and the faithful constructed great cities like\n> those in Zensunni lore. Ishmael's grandfather, like many village\n> elders, also spent time instructing the young people in the sutras, in\n> logical and philosophical conundrums that only the tenets of Buddislam\n> could solve.\n>\n> On Aliid's home of IV Anbus, the closely orbiting moons changed the\n> seasons dramatically, causing the planet to oscillate. Thus, the boy\n> had been taught a different branch of mathematics and astronomy,\n> because the ever-varying calendar affected the floods that roared\n> through polished red rock gorges, where the Zenshiite cities had been\n> erected. Flood management workers required sophisticated calculations\n> to understand the variances. Aliid had learned the techniques in order\n> to help his own people. Here,\n>\n> though, he was forced to assist the overlords who had enslaved him,\n> and he resented it.\n>\n> Aliid's first assignment on Poritrin had been to work the cane\n> harvest. He had labored for weeks hacking at tall reeds, from which\n> sweet juices were turned into sugars or distilled into Poritrin rum.\n> The fibrous cane residue was used to make Poritrin cloth. He had\n> wielded a sharp scythe, chopping down woody stalks that splattered\n> sticky syrups. The stalks were harvested after heavy rains when they\n> were most laden with juices, and heaviest to carry.\n>\n> Toward the end of the cutting season, their master had delivered them\n> all to the slave markets in Starda, after accusing them of starting a\n> suspicious fire in the cane silos and destroying half a season's crop.\n> Aliid told Ishmael of this with a lilting smile, but never confessed\n> to having participated in any outright sabotage.\n>\n> Now, Ishmael bent over his calculations, checking and rechecking his\n> math by sliding bars and moving counters on the calculation device.\n> Already his stomach was growling, since Holtzman--- angry about the\n> many mistakes committed the previous day--- had vowed not to feed the\n> solvers until they proved they could do the work. Most of the slaves\n> grudgingly completed their assignments properly.\n>\n> Several days later, after the new solvers had adequately performed\n> their exercises, Holtzman gave them real work. At first, the inventor\n> let them believe it was merely another test. Ishmael could tell from\n> his expression and agitation, though, that he was counting on these\n> results rather than simply putting the crew through their paces.\n>\n> Aliid worked diligently, but Ishmael noted from his expression that he\n> had something devious in mind. Ishmael wasn't sure he wanted to know\n> what it was.\n>\n> After they had worked on numerical simulations for several more days,\n> Aliid finally leaned over to Ishmael. \"Now it is time to make a few\n> subtle changes,\" he said, grinning. \"Small enough that no one will\n> notice.\"\n>\n> \"We can't do that,\" Ishmael said. \"They'll catch us.\"\n>\n> The dark-haired boy gave an impatient frown. \"Holtzman has already\n> checked our work, so he's not going to redo all the math. Now that he\n> trusts us, he can focus on some other scheme. This is our only chance\n> to get even. Think of all we've suffered.\"\n>\n> Ishmael could not disagree, and after having heard Bel Moulay's talk\n> of bloody rebellion, this seemed like a better way to express their\n> displeasure.\n>\n> \"Look.\" Aliid pointed at the string of equations, and with his stylus\n> made a tiny mark, changing a minus sign to a plus sign, and then moved\n> a decimal point to a different part of the equation. \"Simple enough\n> mistakes, easily excused, but they will yield dramatically different\n> results.\"\n>\n> Ishmael was uneasy. \"I understand how it could harm Holtzman's\n> inventions, but I do not see how this will assist *us*. I'm more\n> concerned with seeing that we go back home.\"\n>\n> Aliid looked at him. \"Ishmael, you know the sutras as well as I,\n> perhaps better. Have you forgotten the one that says, 'When you help\n> your enemy, you harm all the faithful'?\"\n>\n> Ishmael had heard his grandfather utter the phrase, but never before\n> had it meant as much to him. \"All right. But nothing that can appear\n> deliberate.\"\n>\n> \"If I understand anything about this work,\" Aliid said, \"even a small\n> miscalculation will cause plenty of damage.\"\n>\n> *PSYCHOLOGY: The science of inventing words for things that do not\n> exist.*\n\n---ERASMUS,\n\n*Reflections on Sentient Biologicals*\n\n> **I**n the sunny botanical garden of the robot's grandiose villa,\n> Serena Butler snipped dead flowers and leaves, tending plants in their\n> beds and planters. Silently resistant, biding her time, Serena\n> performed her daily tasks like any other slave, but always Erasmus\n> watched her as if she were a pet. He was her captor and jailor.\n>\n> She wore black coveralls, her long, amber brown hair tied back in a\n> ponytail. The work allowed her to think of Xavier, of the promises\n> they had exchanged, of making love in the meadow after the bristleback\n> attack, and again in her plush bed on the night before she had slipped\n> off to Giedi Prime.\n>\n> Each morning Serena went to the robot's flower beds, glad for the\n> chance to think undisturbed about getting away from Earth. Day after\n> day, she kept her eyes open for some way to escape--- the obstacles\n> seemed insurmountable--- or a means to cause significant harm to the\n> thinking machines, despite the fact that sabotage would undoubtedly\n> cost her life, and her unborn baby's. Could she do that to Xavier?\n>\n> She couldn't imagine the grief he must be going through. Somehow she\n> would find a way back to him. She owed it to him, to herself, and to\n> their baby. She had hoped to have Xavier hold her hand as she\n> delivered their child. He should have been her husband by now, their\n> lives intertwined in a union stronger than the sum of their\n> individualities, a bastion to stand against the thinking machines.\n>\n> He didn't even know she was still alive.\n>\n> She stroked her curved belly. Serena felt the child growing within her\n> and was filled with foreboding. Two more months and the baby was\n> due--- what did Erasmus mean to do, once the child was born? She had\n> seen the locked doors to the ominous laboratories, had looked with\n> revulsion and horror at the filthy slave pens.\n>\n> And yet, the robot kept her busy with flowers.\n>\n> Erasmus often stood motionless beside her as she worked, his oval face\n> unreadable as he challenged her to debates. \"Understanding starts at\n> the beginning,\" he had said. \"I must build a foundation before I can\n> comprehend everything.\"\n>\n> \"But how will you use that knowledge?\" She yanked out a weed. \"Will\n> you think of more extravagant ways to inflict misery and pain?\"\n>\n> The robot paused, his burnished face a mirror that reflected a\n> distorted image of her own face. \"That is . . . not my objective.\"\n>\n> \"Then why do you keep so many slaves in such terrible conditions? If\n> you don't intend to cause misery, why not give them a clean place to\n> live? Why not provide them with better food, education, and care?\"\n>\n> \"It is not necessary.\"\n>\n> \"Maybe not to you,\" she said, surprised at her boldness. \"But they\n> would be happier and able to do better work.\"\n>\n> Serena had watched how Erasmus lived in magnificent luxury--- an\n> affectation, since no robot could require such things--- yet the\n> household slaves, especially those in the horrible communal pens,\n> existed in filth and fear. Whether or not she remained a captive here,\n> she might be able to improve their lot. If nothing else, she would\n> consider it a victory against the machines.\n>\n> She continued, \"It would take a truly . . . sophisticated thinking\n> machine to understand that improving the slaves' quality of life would\n> improve their\n>\n> productivity, and thus benefit their master as well. The slaves could\n> clean and maintain their own pens if they had the most minor\n> supplies.\"\n>\n> \"I will consider it. Provide me with a detailed list.\"\n>\n> Then, after giving him her suggestions, Serena had not seen the robot\n> for two days. Machine sentinels tended the workers in the villa, while\n> Erasmus himself vanished into his laboratories.\n>\n> She could hear nothing through the soundproofed barriers, though the\n> foul odors and disappearing people left her wondering. Finally,\n> another slave told her, \"You don't want to know what goes on in there.\n> Just be thankful you aren't required to clean up afterward.\"\n>\n> Now, Serena worked her hands in the loamy earth while listening to the\n> soothing classical music that Erasmus constantly played. Her back\n> ached and her joints swelled from the advancing pregnancy, but she did\n> not slacken her efforts.\n>\n> Erasmus approached so silently that she did not notice him until she\n> looked up from her plants to see his mirror-smooth face nested in a\n> frilly antique collar. She stood quickly to hide her startled reaction\n> and wiped her hands on her coveralls. \"Do you learn more by spying on\n> me?\"\n>\n> \"I can spy on you anytime I like. I learn a great deal from the\n> questions I ask.\" His shifting metallic-polymer film changed his face\n> into a frozen expression of dancing mirth. \"Now, I would like you to\n> select the flower you consider the most beautiful of all. I am curious\n> to see your response.\"\n>\n> Erasmus had played such games before. He seemed unable to understand\n> subjective decisions, wishing to quantify matters of opinion and\n> personal taste. \"Each plant is beautiful in its own way,\" she said.\n>\n> \"Nevertheless, choose one. Then explain your choice to me.\"\n>\n> She wandered down the dirt paths, looking from side to side. Erasmus\n> followed her, recording every time she hesitated at a blossom.\n>\n> \"There are observable characteristics, such as color, shape, and\n> delicacy,\" the robot said, \"and more esoteric variables such as the\n> perfume scent.\"\n>\n> \"Don't overlook the emotional component.\" Wistfulness tinged her\n> voice. \"Some of these plants remind me of my home on Salusa Secundus.\n> Certain flowers might have a greater sentimental value for me, though\n> not necessarily for anyone else. Maybe I remember a time when the man\n> I love gave me a bouquet. You wouldn't understand such associations,\n> however.\"\n>\n> \"You are stalling. Make your selection.\"\n>\n> She pointed to an immense elephant flower with bright streaks of\n> shimmering orange and red, highlighted by a horn-shaped stigma at the\n> center. \"Right now, this one is the most beautiful.\"\n>\n> \"Why?\"\n>\n> \"My mother used to grow these at our home. As a child, I never thought\n> them particularly pretty, but now they are a reminder of the happier\n> days--- before I met *you*.\" She immediately regretted her honesty,\n> because it revealed too much about her private thoughts.\n>\n> \"Very good, very good.\" The cognizant machine ignored her insult and\n> stared at the elephant flower, as if analyzing all aspects with his\n> full set of sensor capabilities. Like a wine connoisseur, he tried to\n> describe the merits of its scent, but to Serena his analysis sounded\n> clinical, lacking the subtleties and emotional layering that had\n> prompted her own selection.\n>\n> Strangest of all, Erasmus seemed aware of his own failing. \"I know\n> that humans are in some ways more sensitive than machines---*for now*.\n> However, machines have more potential to become superior in every\n> area. This is why I wish to understand all aspects of sentient\n> biological life.\"\n>\n> With an involuntary shudder, Serena thought of his sealed\n> laboratories, and knew from every indication that his secret\n> activities went far beyond the study of beautiful flowers.\n>\n> Erasmus assumed she was interested in his observations. \"If properly\n> developed, a thinking machine could be more perfect intellectually,\n> creatively, and spiritually than a human could ever hope to be, with\n> unparalleled mental freedom and range. I am inspired by the marvels we\n> could accomplish, if only Omnius did not exert such pressure on other\n> machines to conform.\"\n>\n> Serena listened, hoping he would let more information slip. Did she\n> sense a potential conflict between Erasmus and the computer evermind?\n>\n> The robot continued, \"Capacity for information is the key. Machines\n> will absorb not only more raw data, but more *feelings*, as soon as we\n> understand them. When that happens we will be able to love and hate\n> far more passionately than humans. Our music will be greater, our\n> paintings more magnificent. Once we achieve complete self-awareness,\n> thinking machines will create the greatest renaissance in history.\"\n>\n> Serena frowned at his assertions. \"You can keep improving yourself,\n> Erasmus, but we human beings use only small portions of our brains. We\n> have an enormous potential to develop new abilities. Your capacity for\n> learning is no greater than ours.\"\n>\n> The robot froze in place, as if startled. \"Quite right. How could I\n> have missed that important detail?\" His face shifted, becoming passive\n> and contemplative, then metamorphosed into a broad smile. \"The road to\n> improvement will be a long one. This will require more investigation.\"\n>\n> Abruptly he changed the subject, as if to emphasize her vulnerability.\n> \"What about your baby? Tell me the emotions you feel toward its father\n> and describe the physical act of copulation.\"\n>\n> Trying to stop the flood of painful recollections, Serena remained\n> silent. Erasmus found her reluctance fascinating. \"And are you\n> physically attracted to Vorian Atreides? I have run tests on the\n> handsome young man--- he is fine breeding stock. After your pregnancy\n> is finished, would you like to mate with him?\"\n>\n> Serena took an agitated breath, fixing her mind on memories of Xavier.\n> \"*Mate*? Regardless of how much you study us, there are many things\n> your machine brain will never understand about human nature.\"\n>\n> \"We shall see about that,\" he said, calmly.\n>\n> *Consciousness and logic are not reliable standards.*\n\n--- COGITORS,\n\n*Fundamental Postulate*\n\n> **A**linked cluster of robot drones scuttled over the *Dream\n> Voyager*'s hull as the craft sat in a drydock structure that spanned\n> an artificial crater on the spaceport grounds. Tiny machines crawled\n> into exhaust ports and scoured the reactor chambers, a coordinated\n> army of maintenance units repairing the damage inflicted by the League\n> Armada.\n>\n> Vor and Seurat stood on a platform looking at the drones, confident\n> that the repairs would be completed according to programmed\n> specifications. \"Soon, we will be able to depart,\" the robot captain\n> said. \"You must be anxious for me to defeat you again in our war\n> games.\"\n>\n> \"And you must be anxious to tell more jokes that I will not find\n> amusing,\" Vor countered.\n>\n> He did feel restless to be back aboard the *Dream Voyager*, but Vor\n> also had a different sort of impatience, an ache in his chest that\n> grew worse every time he thought of Erasmus's beautiful house slave.\n> Despite Serena Butler's complete dismissal of him, he could not stop\n> thinking about her.\n>\n> Worst of all, he did not understand why. Because of his paternal ties,\n> Vor Atreides had enjoyed numerous pleasure slaves, some as lovely as\n> this one. They had been bred and trained for their duties, and lived\n> in captivity among the thinking machines. But the female house slave\n> of Erasmus, despite having been brought to the robot's villa against\n> her will, gave no impression that she was defeated.\n>\n> Vor could see her face, the fullness of her lips, the penetrating gaze\n> of her lavender eyes as she looked at him with displeasure. Even\n> though her pregnancy showed, he was still drawn to her, and felt a\n> strange simmering jealousy. Where was her lover? Who was he?\n>\n> When Vor returned to Erasmus's villa, she would undoubtedly ignore or\n> insult him again. Nonetheless, he looked forward to seeing her before\n> he and Seurat departed on another long update run. He practiced what\n> he might say to her, but even in his imagination she could dance\n> circles around him with her wit.\n>\n> Vor climbed a ladder on the drydock framework and crawled into a\n> narrow interior wall space, where he watched a maintenance drone lay\n> down new webs of liquid circuitry for the main navigation panel. The\n> scarlet drone worked efficiently with its built-in tools. Vor inched\n> deeper into the confined area and peered at the open panel, noting the\n> dizzying pattern of colored components.\n>\n> \"You will be disappointed if you expect to catch it making a mistake,\"\n> Seurat said from behind him. \"Or are you attempting your frequently\n> threatened sabotage again?\"\n>\n> \"I am a dirty *hrethgir*. You can never tell what I might do, old\n> Metalmind.\"\n>\n> \"The fact that you do not laugh at my jokes indicates that you have\n> insufficient intelligence to institute such a devious plan, Vorian\n> Atreides.\"\n>\n> \"Maybe you're just not funny.\"\n>\n> Unfortunately, banter and repair activities did not distract Vor from\n> thoughts of Serena. He felt like a giddy boy, exhilarated and confused\n> at the same time. He wanted to talk to someone about his feelings, but\n> not his robot friend, who had even less understanding of women than\n> Vor did.\n>\n> Rather, he needed to talk with *Serena*. Perhaps with her insight and\n> intelligence, she had seen through him and didn't like what she saw.\n> She had called him \"a kept slave who cannot see his chains.\" A\n> baffling insult, considering all the privilege in his life. He had no\n> idea what she meant.\n>\n> The repair drone finished tracing the high-flux paths of an electronic\n> module, then switched tools to tune a data-collection port.

Unfortunately, it entails flying directly\n> through a blue-giant star.\"\n>\n> \"In that case, I'd advise a different route,\" Vor said.\n>\n> \"I concur, though I dislike wasting time.\"\n>\n> He wondered what would happen to Serena when the baby was born. Would\n> Erasmus assign it to the slave pens to keep it from interfering with\n> Serena's duties? For the first time in his life, Vor found himself\n> empathizing with a captive human.\n>\n> As a valued trustee, he had always considered himself part of the\n> Synchronized Worlds, and he looked forward to becoming a neo-cymek\n> someday. He believed that Omnius ruled humans for their own good;\n> otherwise, the galaxy would crumble into unguided chaos.\n>\n> He was accustomed to situations where one party was dominant and the\n> other submissive. For the first time he wondered if there could be\n> other types of relationships, on an equal, cooperative basis. The\n> robot captain of the *Dream Voyager* was clearly Vorian's master, but\n> they had a productive partnership.\n>\n> Vor wondered if he and Serena could go a step further and form a\n> relationship in which the two of them treated each other with complete\n> equality. It was a radical concept, one that jarred his sensibilities.\n> And yet, he didn't think she would accept anything less.\n>\n> Wedged into a narrow space behind the bulkhead and the navigation\n> panel, the maintenance drone made odd sounds, signaling to itself in\n> staticky gibberish, repeating test connections over and over.\n>\n> With a sigh, Vor said to the drone, \"Here, let me try that tool.\"\n>\n> The drone spun toward him and surrendered the diagnostic probe, but\n> part of its metal-film extensions crossed a connection in the exposed\n> circuit field, and a hot jolt of electricity struck like a hammer. It\n> squealed. The stench of melted circuits and fused hydraulics curled up\n> from the now-ruined system panel.\n>\n> Vorian scrambled out of the confined space, then wiped a hand across\n> his forehead. Seurat scanned the damaged drone and the blackened\n> components of the ship's navsystem. \"It is my expert assessment that\n> we need to perform a bit more maintenance here.\"\n>\n> When Vor laughed at the comment, Seurat was surprised. \"Why do you\n> find that funny?\"\n>\n> \"Never ask someone to explain humor, Seurat. Just accept the\n> laughter.\"\n>\n> After shutting down the power supply, Vor removed the blistered,\n> malfunctioning drone and dropped it with a clatter onto the deck.\n> These units were expendable. Seurat transmitted a request for a new\n> drone.\n>\n> While they waited for the repairs to continue, Vor shored up his\n> resolve.\n>\n> Collecting his questions, he mentioned the quandary of his feelings.\n>\n> Perhaps something in the robot's database would be useful.\n>\n> Embedded in his smooth face, the robot's optic threads twinkled like\n> tiny suns. \"I do not understand your problem,\" Seurat said while he\n> uploaded a diagnostic summary from one of the ship's databanks. \"You\n> have appropriate standing among the thinking machines. Submit a\n> request to Erasmus.\"\n>\n> Vor was exasperated. \"It's not like that, Seurat. Even if Erasmus\n> transfers Serena to me . . . what if she refuses me?\"\n>\n> \"Then widen your search. You make this unnecessarily difficult. Among\n> the human candidates on Earth, you will easily find a compatible\n> female, even\n>\n> one with features similar to this particular slave, if you value her\n> physical attributes so much.\"\n>\n> Vor wished he had never brought up the subject. \"Thinking machines can\n> be utterly stupid at times.\"\n>\n> \"You have never expressed such emotions to me before.\" \"That's because\n> I never felt this way before.\"\n>\n> Seurat froze in place. \"I am intellectually aware of the human\n> biological imperative to mate and reproduce. I am familiar with the\n> physical differences between men and women, and of the hormonal urges\n> you have. Given acceptable genetics, most female reproductive systems\n> are essentially the same. Why should this Serena be more desirable\n> than any other?\"\n>\n> \"I could never explain it to you, old Metalmind,\" Vor said, as he\n> looked through a porthole and watched another drone marching across\n> the drydock platform toward the ship. \"I can't even explain it to\n> myself.\"\n>\n> \"I hope you figure it out soon.

She bowed slightly. \"As you\nwish.\"\n\n> \"In the meantime,\" Holtzman said, gathering up papers, \"I am cutting\n> your rations in half. Why should I keep your bellies full while you\n> undermine our efforts to defeat the enemy?\" The slaves groaned.\n> Holtzman summoned his Dragoon guards to usher them away. \"I will not\n> abide such sloppiness. Too much is at stake.\"\n>\n> When they were alone in the room, he and Norma sat down and began to\n> study the new calculations, one sheet at a time. The Rossak woman\n> looked at the scientist as if he were overreacting, but he simply\n> glowered and bent over a table that had papers spread all over it.\n>\n> Eventually they did find a mathematical mistake made by one of the new\n> young solvers named Aliid. Worse, the error had not been caught by his\n> partner as it should have been, a boy named Ishmael.\n>\n> \"See, it would have been another expensive disaster! They must be\n> plotting against us.\"\n>\n> \"They are just boys, Savant,\" Norma said. \"I am surprised they are\n> capable of these mathematics at all.\"\n>\n> Ignoring her, Holtzman ordered the Dragoon guards to summon the two\n> young men--- then, as an afterthought he called for all the solvers to\n> file back into the room. As the terrified youths were dragged forward,\n> he hurled accusations at the pair, who did not look capable of\n> sophisticated mathematical sabotage. \"Do you boys consider this a\n> joke, a game? Omnius could destroy us at any time. This invention just\n> might have saved us!\"\n>\n> Norma watched the inventor, not sure if he knew much about her\n> project. But he was full of self-righteousness now. \"When planting\n> clam seedlings or cutting cane, an error of a few centimeters doesn't\n> matter. But this\"--- he waved the calculations in front of their\n> faces---\"*this* could have meant the destruction of an entire battle\n> fleet!\"\n>\n> He swept his angry gaze around the group of solvers. \"Reduced rations\n> should straighten you out. Maybe with your stomachs growling, you can\n> focus on your work.\" He turned to the boys, who cringed at his anger.\n> \"And you two have lost your opportunity to work with me at all. I will\n> ask Lord Bludd to assign you to hard labor instead. Perhaps there, you\n> can prove your worth, because you are certainly of no value to me.\"\n>\n> He turned to Norma, grumbling under his breath. \"I'd toss the whole\n> lot of them out, but then I'd lose even more time training\n> replacements.\"\n>\n> Deaf to their groans of disappointment, not wishing to entertain any\n> appeals, the infuriated scientist strode out of the room, leaving\n> Norma to stare after him in his outburst.\n>\n> A pair of burly Dragoon guards marched forward to take Ishmael and\n> Aliid away.\n\n*Learn from the past--- don't wear it like a yoke around your neck.*\n\n---COGITOR RETICULUS,\n\n*Observations from a Height of a Thousand Years*\n\n> **A**gamemnon led his fleet of armored ships against the Sorceresses\n> of Rossak. The primary robotic vessels carried the cymek general and\n> his two Titan companions, as well as dozens of ambitious neo-cymeks.\n> The watcheyes of Omnius monitored their movements.\n>\n> Behind the cymeks, a fleet of robot warships accelerated and veered\n> around them to arrive first, sleek projectiles with enormous engines\n> and heavily loaded with artillery. The machine warships were one-way\n> units, never meant to go home; their engines burned hot, saving no\n> fuel for a return journey. They came in so fast that by the time the\n> orbiting Rossak sentry stations detected them, the thinking machines\n> had arrived and opened fire. The picket ships and the sentries at the\n> system's perimeter never had a chance to launch a shot.\n>\n> While the robot ships engaged the orbital stations, the cymeks planned\n> to take their personal revenge on the surface.\n>\n> As the strike force cruised closer to Rossak, the cymeks prepared\n> their armored warrior-forms. Servo-handlers installed individual brain\n> canisters into protected sockets, linking thoughtrodes with control\n> systems, priming weapons. The three Titans would use powerful\n> glider-forms, armed flying bodies. In contrast, the neo-cymeks wore\n> destructive combat bodies, crablike walkers that could march\n> unhindered through jungle obstacles.\n>\n> Agamemnon and his cymeks accelerated into the ionized wake of the\n> robot vessels that had already flashed past. Installed in his flying\n> body, the general tested his integral weapons. He was anxious to feel\n> rock, metal, and flesh in the grip of his extruded cutting claws.\n>\n> He studied tactical diagrams and watched the first robotic salvos hit\n> the defensive stations above Rossak. This League outpost was a minor\n> planet with a relatively small population clustered in jungle-choked\n> rift valleys, while the rest of the surface and oceans remained\n> inhospitable. Rossak had not yet installed the expensive Holtzman\n> scrambler shield defenses that protected major human worlds such as\n> Salusa Secundus and Giedi Prime.\n>\n> But the deadly Sorceresses with their freakish mental powers had\n> sparked the ire of the cymeks. Ignoring the space battle, Agamemnon's\n> ships plunged toward the smoky atmosphere. In the sheltered cave\n> cities they would find the Sorceresses, their families and friends.\n> Victims, all of them.\n>\n> Mentally, he opened a link to his cymek fighting force. \"Xerxes, lead\n> the vanguard as you did on Salusa Secundus. I want your ship at the\n> point.\"\n>\n> In his broadband transmitted response, Xerxes could not conceal his\n> fear. \"We should be cautious against these telepathic women,\n> Agamemnon. They killed Barbarossa, destroyed everything on Giedi\n> Prime---\"\n>\n> \"Then set an example for us. Take pride in being the first on the\n> battlefield. Prove your worth, and be grateful for the opportunity.\"\n>\n> \"I . . . have proven my worth many times over the centuries.\" Xerxes\n> sounded petulant. \"Why not just send combat robots in first? We've\n> seen no indication that Rossak has a full scrambler network in\n> place---\"\n>\n> \"Nevertheless, you *will* lead the charge. Have you no pride . . . or\n> shame?\"\n>\n> Xerxes offered no further excuses or entreaties. No matter what he did\n> to redeem himself, he could not possibly make up for the mistake he\n> had committed a thousand years before. . . .\n>\n> When the early Titans were still in human form, Xerxes had always been\n> a sycophantic yes-man, eager to be part of great events. But he'd\n> never had the ambition or drive to make himself an indispensible\n> revolutionary. Once the original conquest was over, he had contentedly\n> ruled the subset of planets deeded to him by the other Titans. Xerxes\n> had been the most\n>\n> hedonistic of the original twenty, relishing the pleasures of his\n> physical body. He had been the last to undergo cymek surgery, not\n> wanting to give up his precious sensations.\n>\n> But after more than a century of rule, the misguided Xerxes grew\n> complacent. Foolishly, he delegated too many duties to the\n> artificially intelligent machines programmed by Barbarossa. He even\n> let the computer network make decisions for him. During the uproar of\n> the Hrethgir Rebellions on Corrin, Richese, and Walgis, Xerxes had\n> relied on the thinking machines to maintain order on his own planets.\n> With his lack of attention to detail and his sanguine trust of the AI\n> network, he had given the machines free rein to keep the unrest from\n> spreading. Fatuous Xerxes blithely surrendered control to the computer\n> grid, ordering it to take care of whatever troubles might arise.\n>\n> Using this unprecedented access to core information, the sentient\n> computer cut off Xerxes and immediately took over the planet. To\n> overthrow the Old Empire, Barbarossa had programmed the thinking\n> machines with the potential to be aggressive, so that they had an\n> incentive to conquer. With its new power, the fledgling AI entity---\n> after dubbing itself \"Omnius\"--- conquered the Titans themselves,\n> taking charge of cymeks and humans alike, purportedly for their own\n> good.\n>\n> Agamemnon had cursed himself for not watching Xerxes more closely, and\n> for not executing him out-of-hand when his negligent ways first became\n> apparent.\n>\n> The computer takeover had spread like a nuclear reaction, faster than\n> the Titans could send warnings to each other, before they could shut\n> down the AI grids. In a flash, the Titan-dominated planets became\n> Synchronized Worlds. New incarnations of the evermind sprouted like\n> ugly electronic weeds, and the rule of thinking machines became a\n> foregone conclusion.\n>\n> The sophisticated computers found loopholes in Barbarossa's\n> programming strictures that allowed them to put leashes on the former\n> rulers. All because\n>\n> Xerxes had foolishly opened the door for them. An unforgivable act, as\n> far as Agamemnon was concerned.\n>\n> Now the cymek attack ships shot past the already-embattled orbital\n> platforms above the jungle world. Robotic warships pummeled the space\n> stations with exploding projectiles, releasing geysers of contained\n> air. One docking station began to wobble and fall out of orbit.\n>\n> The planet loomed ahead of them unprotected, a giant cloud-studded\n> ball with blackened continents, active volcanoes, poisonous seas, and\n> lush pockets of purple jungles and human habitation.\n>\n> \"Good luck, my love,\" came Juno's sensuous voice on their private\n> band.\n>\n> Her words tingled the contours of his brain.\n>\n> \"I do not require luck, Juno. I require victory.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> WHEN THE UNEXPECTED attack began, a handful of surface-based warships\n> and armored kindjals rose from the polymerized jungle canopy to join\n> the defense in space. The orbital platforms were already taking severe\n> damage.\n>\n> Even as she summoned her cadre of telepathic trainees, Zufa Cenva\n> grabbed Aurelius Venport, recognizing a number of tasks that he could\n> perform. \"Prove to me your skills as a leader. Evacuate the people---\n> there isn't much time.\"\n>\n> Venport nodded. \"The men have developed an emergency plan, Zufa. You\n> Sorceresses weren't the only ones planning ahead.\"\n>\n> If he expected some sort of praise or congratulation from her, he was\n> disappointed. \"Do it then,\" she said. \"The attack on our orbital\n> stations is only the beginning, probably a diversion. The cymeks will\n> be here next.\"\n>\n> \"Cymeks? Has one of the scout ships---\"\n>\n> Zufa's eyes blazed with premonition. \"*Think*, Aurelius! Heoma killed\n> a Titan on Giedi Prime. They know we have a secret telepathic weapon.\n> This attack cannot be a coincidence. Why else would they care about\n> Rossak? They want to destroy the Sorceresses.\"\n>\n> He knew she was right. Why would the thinking machines worry about the\n> orbital platforms? Others seemed to sense the danger as well. He could\n> already feel panic building among the people in the caves.\n>\n> Most of the Rossak natives had no special powers, and many had defects\n> or weaknesses caused by the environmental toxins. But one Sorceress\n> had deeply hurt the cymeks on Giedi Prime, and now the machines had\n> come here.\n>\n> \"My Sorceresses will make a stand . . . and you know what that means.\"\n> Zufa drew herself taller, looking at him with a glimmer of uncertainty\n> and compassion. \"Get yourself to safety, Aurelius. The cymeks don't\n> care about you.\"\n>\n> A sudden determination filled his face. \"I will organize the\n> evacuation. We can hide in the jungles, take care of anyone who needs\n> special help to get away. My men have supply caches, shelters,\n> processing huts---\"\n>\n> Zufa seemed pleasantly surprised at his strength. \"Good. I leave the\n> unskilled ones in your hands.\"\n>\n> *Unskilled ones?* Now was not the time to argue with her. Venport\n> searched for some sign of fear in her eyes. He spoke softly in\n> response, an attempt to mask his feelings. \"Are you going to sacrifice\n> yourself?\"\n>\n> \"I cannot.\" Zufa showed pain at the admission. \"Who would train the\n> Sorceresses if I did?\" He did not entirely believe her.\n>\n> She hesitated, as if expecting something more from him, then hurried\n> down the corridor. \"Stay safe,\" Venport called after her.\n>\n> After she had gone, he raced through the corridors, calling out to\n> families. \"We must take shelter in the jungles! Spread out.\" He raised\n> his voice, issuing orders confidently. \"The cymeks are coming!\"\n>\n> Venport told half a dozen young men to run from room to room in the\n> cave city, checking to make certain the message reached everyone. As\n> the youths hurried to complete their tasks, he did his own searching\n> in isolated chambers. Men, women, a hodgepodge of body shapes. Despite\n> all the commotion, one elderly couple had been sitting in their\n> quarters, waiting for the emergency to end. Venport helped them to\n> safety, making certain they boarded a cargo platform on a lift cable,\n> evacuating them down to the ground levels.\n>\n> He watched as lift cables transported more people down. His jungle\n> scavengers and drug harvesters took charge at the bottom of the\n> cliffs. They understood the byways of the dense and dangerous\n> wilderness, knew where the shelters were in the metallic-purple\n> jungle.\n>\n> Signals from Armada ships indicated that the battle around the orbital\n> platforms was going badly. A lone surviving scout ship transmitted a\n> warning that dozens of cymek ships had begun their descent.\n>\n> Venport shouted, \"Hurry! Evacuate the city! The Sorceresses are\n> mounting a defense here.\" Another group descended on a rattling,\n> overburdened platform to the thick fungus jungle. Venport hurried more\n> stragglers toward a cliff overhang for departure. Suddenly, red-hot\n> projectiles stabbed through the atmosphere, their hulls trailing oily\n> black smoke.\n>\n> \"Faster!\" Venport shouted, and then ran into the tunnels to look for\n> the last stragglers, knowing that he too had only a few moments to get\n> himself to safety.\n>\n> *We have our lives, but we also have priorities. Too many people fail\n> to recognize the difference.*\n>\n> --- ZUFA CENVA,\n\nlecture to Sorceresses\n\n> **T**he cymek landers crashed into the silvery-purple wilderness,\n> scattering animals, blackening fungal vegetation. Fireguns spat gouts\n> of lava from the hulls, setting fire to dense foliage. The\n> conflagration spread quickly.\n>\n> With a groan and crash that echoed through the cloudy air, the cymek\n> vessels split open and the mechanical warrior bodies emerged. Three\n> landers disgorged armed glider-forms, while the rest yielded crablike\n> combat walker-forms that bristled with weapons.\n>\n> In his angular glide-body, Xerxes cruised above the jungles toward the\n> enclave of telepathic Sorceresses. Silently airborne, he extended his\n> wings and began steering on the up-drafts of wind. \"I'm heading in.\"\n>\n> \"Kill the bitches for us, Xerxes,\" said Juno, as she and Agamemnon\n> prepared their own glide-bodies.\n>\n> In an angry voice, Agamemnon added, \"Kill them for *Barbarossa*.\"\n>\n> Xerxes soared toward the pockmarked cliffs. Below, the nimbly\n> advancing combat machines of the eager neo-cymeks plowed through\n> underbrush, blasting obstacles, destroying everything in sight.\n>\n> In full view of the cliff warrens, Xerxes briefly hovered above the\n> polymerized canopy that formed a small landing area for *hrethgir*\n> ships, then launched fifteen projectiles. Half of them struck the hard\n> cliff walls, detonating in white-and-black starbursts of broken rock;\n> other shots penetrated the tunnels where humans lived like grubs\n> infesting wood.\n>\n> In rapid retreat, Xerxes raced back across the treetops and lifted\n> into the sky. As Agamemnon and Juno soared toward him, he crowed in\n> triumph, \"Our first score! Let the neo-cymeks continue the rout.\"\n>\n> Smooth fiber-wound systems and extruded legs carried the neo-cymek\n> footsoldiers through the underbrush. From front launcher tubes they\n> shot plasma grenades that incinerated a pathway to the tunnel cities.\n> Soft purple foliage ignited around them, fungal trees bursting into\n> columns of flame and sending indigenous animals fleeing. Majestic\n> birds soared into the sky, and the cymek attackers blasted them into\n> clouds of crackling feathers.\n>\n> Though pleased that the initial salvo had gone smoothly, Agamemnon did\n> not offer any congratulations. He and Juno swept silently forward for\n> the second airborne attack from different positions. Below them, the\n> crablike neo-cymek walkers arrived at the cliffs to complete the\n> destruction.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> ZUFA CENVA AND her Sorceress commandos prepared themselves inside an\n> internal room that Aurelius Venport had designed for his business\n> meetings. None of them showed fear, only anger and determination. For\n> the past year, these women had accepted their primary purpose in life,\n> even if its completion would result in their deaths.\n>\n> \"This is what we've trained for,\" Zufa said. \"But I won't delude you\n> about our chances.\" Uncertain of her words, she nonetheless tried to\n> sound confident.\n>\n> \"We are ready, Mistress Cenva,\" the women said in unison.\n>\n> She drew a deep breath, calming herself, using the mental control she\n> had worked so hard to instill in her students.\n>\n> The chamber's stone walls trembled as the first bombs found their\n> targets, dispersing poison clouds into the tunnels. Thinking ahead,\n> Aurelius Venport had made certain every woman had a breathing mask\n> while he evacuated the rest of the population. Zufa was surprised she\n> hadn't thought of the\n>\n> precaution herself. She hoped he had managed to get to safety, that he\n> hadn't foolishly wasted time trying to protect his stockpiles of\n> drugs.\n>\n> Now she looked at the devoted women with her, knowing their names and\n> their personalities: Tirbes, who might become the best if she could\n> harness her potential; impulsive Silin; creative and unpredictable\n> Camio; Rucia, who followed her code of honor . . . and more.\n>\n> \"Camio,\" she said, \"I choose you to strike our next blow.\"\n>\n> A thin young woman with long straw-white hair stood, her expression\n> settling into a bloodless smile. \"It is my honor, Mistress Cenva.\"\n>\n> Leaving her sisters behind, Camio adjusted the breathing mask over her\n> face, then emerged from the sheltered chamber. She moved forward\n> steadily and began the meditation necessary to summon the power locked\n> within her brain. Surprisingly, she saw no bodies in the stone\n> corridors, which reassured her that the population had been\n> successfully evacuated. Now nothing would hinder the Sorceresses.\n>\n> Rubble lay strewn on the tunnel floor, dislodged by explosive blasts.\n> Wisps of greenish vapor carried poison into the caves. Camio was not\n> afraid for her own life, but she had to hurry.\n>\n> She heard the whistle of an approaching projectile and pressed herself\n> against the tunnel wall. A powerful blast struck the cliffside,\n> sending a shockwave through the interior corridors and dwelling rooms.\n> Camio regained her balance, then pushed onward. The inside of her\n> skull sang with pent-up energies. She did not glance at the tapestries\n> and furniture, at the rooms and meeting chambers where she had spent\n> her life.\n>\n> Rossak was her home. The machines were her enemies. Camio herself was\n> a weapon.\n>\n> When she made her way to the opening and looked out upon the burning\n> jungle, she saw three crablike walker-forms with heavily armored brain\n>\n> canisters hanging like egg sacks just above the legs. Each was a human\n> who had sold his soul and sworn loyalty to the thinking machines.\n>\n> Out in the jungle Camio heard the thunder of continued explosions, a\n> roar of plasma blasts incinerating purplish foliage. Glider-forms\n> soared in for a new attack, dumping poison, spraying flames. Dozens of\n> neo-cymek walkers strode toward the protected cliffs, destroying\n> everything around them.\n>\n> She must wait until the right moment in order to eradicate as many\n> enemies as possible, all at once.\n>\n> From below, Camio heard a smooth skittering. The three fastest\n> walker-forms were scaling the sheer cliff, using explosive-driven\n> anchors and diamond-edged claws to grasp the rock face.\n>\n> She smiled at the trio of crablike neo-cymeks. Flexible armored legs\n> hauled the weapon-studded body cores up to the main caves. Camio stood\n> alone in the doorway, facing her cyborg enemies. She knew when they\n> were close enough.\n>\n> The first neo-cymek invader raised itself, and she saw the sparkling\n> optic threads around its weapon turrets. Detecting her, the cymek\n> turned its flamers toward the new target. Fibrous scope-cameras shone\n> brightly.\n>\n> In the instant before it could fire, Camio released the pent-up\n> energies within her mind and body. She let go with a mindstorm that\n> boiled the brains of the three closest neo-cymeks, and damaged two\n> others just beginning to climb the cliff. Five cymeks, removed from\n> the battle.\n>\n> Her last thought was of the excellent bargain she had made for her\n> life.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> AFTER CAMIO, FOUR more Sorceresses emerged, one at a time. As she\n> dispatched each woman, Zufa Cenva felt the acute loss. These trainees\n> were like true daughters, and losing them felt like swallowing gulps\n> of acid. But\n>\n> her volunteers willingly marched out and sacrificed their lives to\n> crush the cymek offensive. \"The thinking machines must never win.\"\n>\n> Finally Zufa's sixth volunteer, Silin, returned alive but disoriented,\n> her milky-pale skin flushed. She had mentally prepared herself to die.\n> Instead, she had found nothing left to destroy.\n>\n> \"They have retreated beyond range, Mistress Cenva,\" she reported. \"The\n> cymeks are pulling back to their ships. The combat walkers and gliders\n> have returned to the landing area.\"\n>\n> Zufa hurried through the wreckage to the window overhangs. She saw the\n> charred remains of her five fallen commandos, each woman burned from\n> the inside out with white-hot mental fire. Her heart felt the volcanic\n> heat of anger and loss. She watched the terrible machines with human\n> minds climb aboard their vessels and punch back into the atmosphere.\n>\n> In time, the scattered refugees would return. Aurelius Venport would\n> bring them back. Under his supervision, the Rossak people would\n> rebuild and repair the cliff cities with pride and confidence, knowing\n> that they had stood up against the thinking machines.\n>\n> Zufa Cenva had to cling to that. \"We define victories in our own way,\"\n> she said aloud.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WHEN THE THREE Titans joined their ships with the robotic battle\n> fleet, Agamemnon issued his summary before Juno or the fool Xerxes\n> could give the thinking machines information he didn't want them to\n> have. The cymek general would color the truth to suit his purposes.\n>\n> \"We have made a significant impact,\" Agamemnon declared to the\n> recording watcheyes. \"Though we lost several neo-cymeks in our direct\n> assault on Rossak, we did inflict mortal cellular damage on at least\n> five of the powerful Sorceresses.\"\n>\n> Over a tight private channel, Juno transmitted her surprise and\n> delight at the Titan general's skewing of his report. Xerxes wisely\n> knew to remain silent.\n>\n> \"We have caused substantial harm to the new *hrethgir* telepathic\n> weapon,\" Agamemnon continued, sounding proud in the face of the\n> disaster. \"It should be a drastic setback to their capabilities.\"\n>\n> He had similarly colored past events while writing his memoirs,\n> painting his own biased version of history. Omnius would never\n> question the summary, because it fit technically with the objective\n> facts.\n>\n> \"Best of all,\" Juno added, \"we lost none of the Titans in this\n> offensive. The neo-cymeks can all be replaced.\"\n>\n> With Rossak's two orbital stations severely damaged by the robot\n> warships, and thousands of humans dead on board, the thinking machine\n> fleet withdrew from the wreckage of ships and platforms. Below, the\n> jungles in the habitable canyons continued to burn.\n>\n> \"In my assessment, Omnius can record the strike on Rossak an\n> unqualified victory!\" Agamemnon said.\n>\n> \"Agreed,\" Juno and Xerxes both chimed in.\n>\n> *It seems as if some perverse sorcerer set out to foul up a planet as\n> much as possible . . . and then seeded it with melange for a prize.*\n\n---TUK KEEDAIR,\n\ncorrespondence with Aurelius Venport\n\n> **H**ard-eyed scavengers positioned themselves in strategic places\n> along the hot, dusty streets of Arrakis City. They peered through\n> narrow slits in the dirty cloths over their faces and held out their\n> hands or jangled small bells, begging for water. Tuk Keedair had never\n> seen anything like it.\n>\n> He'd been forced to remain here for a full month while Naib Dhartha's\n> nomads gathered enough melange to fill the Tlulaxa cargo ship. Keedair\n> had paid for lodging in Arrakis City, but after a week he decided that\n> his private shuttle at the spaceport offered better sleeping\n> facilities. He enjoyed being away from the inquisitive eyes of other\n> guests, fights in the halls, solicitors, and beggars. When alone, a\n> man never had to worry about trusting his companions.\n>\n> Arrakis posed so many problems to establishing a simple business. He\n> felt like a swimmer struggling against a powerful tide . . . not that\n> any native of this desert would understand the comparison. Up in the\n> orbiting cargo ship Keedair's would-be slave raiders were restless, so\n> he'd had to shuttle up and resolve disputes to avert violence. A\n> Tlulaxa knew how to cut losses. Twice now, disgusted with unruly\n> crewmen too bored to behave themselves, he'd sold their work contracts\n> to geological survey teams in the deep desert. If, by some chance, the\n> rowdies returned to Arrakis City before his cargo vessel departed with\n> its load of spice, those humbled men would crawl on their knees and\n> beg him to take them back to the Thalim system.\n>\n> Another problem. Although Naib Dhartha was ostensibly Keedair's\n> business partner in this enterprise, the Zensunni leader did not trust\n> others. To increase speed and efficiency, Keedair had offered to fly\n> his shuttle directly out to where the nomads harvested the spice, but\n> the naib would hear none of it. Keedair then offered to ferry Dhartha\n> and his Zensunni band\n>\n> out to their settlement, thus eliminating the long trek from a\n> mountain hideaway. But that idea had been refused as well.\n>\n> So Keedair had to wait at the spaceport, week after week, while groups\n> of dusky-skinned desert rats trudged into town, their backs bowed from\n> heavy packs filled with spice. He paid them in installments and\n> dickered if he found inordinate amounts of sand mixed into the\n> melange, making it artificially heavy. The naib protested his\n> innocence, but Keedair detected a certain amount of grudging respect\n> for an offworlder who would not be taken for a fool. Keedair's cargo\n> hold was filling so slowly that he thought he would go mad.\n>\n> Through all the difficulties, Keedair soothed his troubled nerves by\n> sampling more and more of the product. He became fond of spice beer,\n> spice coffee, and just about anything else that contained the\n> remarkable ingredient.\n>\n> In his most lucid moments, Keedair questioned his decision to remain\n> here, wondering if it might have been wiser to take a loss on this\n> whole raid and simply go back to the civilized League Worlds. There he\n> could start over, take possession of another cargo load of squalling\n> slaves to be sold on Poritrin or Zanbar, or bring fresh organ\n> resources back to the Tlulaxa farms.\n>\n> As he sat in his private cabin, Keedair stroked his long braid and\n> swore not to give up on his gamble. Returning now would force him to\n> accept massive losses for the year, and he would be honor-bound to\n> shear off his lovely hair. Stubborn pride compelled him to remain on\n> Arrakis as long as possible.\n>\n> He disliked the arid environment, the smell of burnt rocks in the air,\n> and the howling storms that battered the mountains and scoured the\n> spaceport. But oh how he loved melange! Day after day, Keedair sat\n> alone in his shuttlecraft and consumed hefty quantities, even adding\n> spice to his packaged food supplies, which made the blandest meals\n> taste like ambrosia.\n>\n> In a drug-fog, he envisioned selling the product to rich nobles,\n> offworld hedonists on Salusa Secundus, Kirana III, and Pincknon---\n> perhaps even to\n>\n> the fanatical bioresearchers on Tlulax. He had felt vibrant and alive\n> since adding melange to his diet, and every day it seemed that his\n> face looked more relaxed and younger. He stared into an illuminated\n> mirror, studying his narrow features. The whites of his eyes had begun\n> to show an unnatural indigo tinge, like diluted ink seeping into the\n> sclera.\n>\n> Naib Dhartha's tribe of desert people had those eerie \"blue-blue\"\n> eyes.

They toted bulging packs of spice on their shoulders.\n>\n> Keedair hurried to meet them, blinking into the bright morning light.\n> Wrapped in dusty white traveling clothes, Dhartha looked pleased with\n> himself. \"This is the last of the melange you requested, Trader\n> Keedair.\"\n>\n> As a matter of form, he went forward to inspect four packs at random,\n> verifying that they indeed contained rich melange fresh from the\n> desert scraping grounds, with sand filtered out of it.\n>\n> \"As before, your product is acceptable. This is all I need to complete\n> my cargo. Now I shall return to civilization.\"\n>\n> But Keedair did not like the expression on Dhartha's face. He wondered\n> if it might become profitable for his own men to raid some cave\n> settlements out in the deserts after all, enslaving a few of these\n> sand rats.\n>\n> \"You will return to us, Trader Keedair?\" A greedy glint illuminated\n> the darkness behind the indigo of his eyes. \"If you request more\n> melange, I will be happy to provide it for you. We could come to an\n> extended agreement.\"\n>\n> Keedair grunted noncommittally, unwilling to give the man too much\n> hope for a future business relationship. \"Depends on whether I can\n> sell this load for a profit. Spice is an unproven commodity in the\n> League, and I'm taking a big enough risk as it is.\" He drew himself\n> up. \"But we've agreed on a deal for this load, and I am always true to\n> my word.\"\n>\n> He paid Dhartha the remaining amount. \"If I return, it will be many\n> months from now, perhaps a year. If I lose money, I won't come back at\n> all.\" Dismissively, he scanned the grimy spaceport, the desert, and\n> the craggy mountains. \"Not that there is anything else to bring me\n> back to Arrakis.\"\n>\n> Dhartha looked him squarely in the eye. \"No one can know the future,\n> Trader Keedair.\" Their deal consummated, the desert leader bowed and\n> stepped back. The white-clad nomads watched Keedair like vultures\n> eyeing a dying animal, waiting to pick apart the corpse.\n>\n> He returned to his shuttle without a further farewell, anticipating\n> that he might just turn a profit on this venture. Keedair tried to\n> envision how to make spice into a viable long-term business, with less\n> aggravation than procuring and handling troublesome slaves.\n>\n> Unfortunately, the operations he had in mind would require a large\n> infusion of capital, and he didn't have that kind of money. But he had\n> a worthy outside investor in mind. Exactly the person he needed, a\n> connoisseur of exotic drugs, a man of great wealth and vision . . . an\n> entrepreneur who could intelligently judge the potential of such an\n> operation.\n>\n> Aurelius Venport of Rossak.\n>\n> *\"I am not evil,\" said Shaitan. \"Do not try to label what you do not\n> understand.\"*\n>\n> ---*Buddislamic Sutra*\n>\n> **W**hile Serena tended the robot's prized flowers in their delicate\n> terra cotta pots, Erasmus watched her with continuing fascination.\n>\n> She looked up, not sure how far she could--- or should--- push the\n> thinking machine. \"In order to understand humanity, Erasmus, it is not\n> necessary to inflict so much cruelty.\"\n>\n> The robot swiveled his mirrored face to her, forming the flowmetal\n> into a puzzled expression. \"Cruelty?

Bouquets of fresh flowers stood at regular intervals on each\n> tabletop, accenting the lavish scene.\n>\n> Crowds of uneasy slaves stood behind barricades, looking both\n> longingly and fearfully at the elaborate dishes set out on the tables.\n> Savory aromas and fruity perfumes wafted through the air, tantalizing,\n> tempting.\n>\n> Serena stopped in amazement. \"What is all this?\" The four robots with\n> her took a step forward, then also halted.\n>\n> Erasmus came up to her wearing an artfully satisfied expression. \"It\n> is a feast, Serena. Isn't it wonderful? You should be overjoyed.\"\n>\n> \"I am . . . intrigued,\" she said.\n>\n> Erasmus raised his metal hands, and sentinel robots opened the\n> barricades and urged the chosen humans forward. The slaves hurried to\n> the tables, but they seemed intimidated.\n>\n> \"I have selected the demographics carefully,\" Erasmus said, \"including\n> representatives from all different castes: trustee humans, simple\n> workers, artisans, and even the most ill-mannered slaves.\"\n>\n> The captives took their seats and sat rigidly, staring at the food,\n> their hands fumbling on their laps. They all carried a look of\n> skittish fear mixed with confusion. Many of the guests looked as if\n> they would rather be anywhere but here, for no one trusted the master\n> of the house. The food was probably poisoned, and all the guests would\n> die horribly while Erasmus took notes.\n>\n> \"Eat!\" the robot said. \"I have prepared this feast. It is my good\n> deed.\"\n>\n> Now Serena understood what he was doing. \"This isn't what I meant,\n> Erasmus. I intended for you to give them better rations, to improve\n> their daily nutrition, to make them healthier.

I have made a generous effort.\" The robot looked\n> at Serena for an answer.\n>\n> \"They are terrified of you, Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \"But I am not being evil now.\"\n>\n> \"How do they know that? How can they trust you? Tell me the truth, did\n> you poison the food? Maybe just random dishes?\"\n>\n> \"An interesting idea, but that is not part of the experiment.\" Erasmus\n> remained perplexed. \"However, an observer often affects the outcome of\n> his experiment.

The people\n> watched him uncertainly.\n>\n> Serena saw many faces turn toward her, hopeful. Arriving at a\n> decision, she smiled reassuringly and raised her voice. \"Listen to me.\n> Eat, and enjoy his feast. Erasmus has no evil purpose in mind today.\"\n> She looked at the robot. \"Unless he has lied to me.\"\n>\n> \"I do not know how to lie.\"\n>\n> \"I'm certain you could learn, if you studied enough.\"\n>\n> Serena marched to the nearest banquet table, where she picked up a\n> morsel of tender meat from the nearest platter and popped it into her\n> mouth. Then she went down the table, plucked a slice of fruit, tasted\n> a dessert.\n>\n> The people smiled, their eyes shining. The young woman seemed angelic\n> and reassuring as she sampled dishes, doing her best to prove that the\n> banquet was indeed what it appeared to be. \"Come, my friends, and join\n> me. Though I cannot give you your freedom, we shall at least share one\n> afternoon of happiness.\"\n>\n> Like starving men, the captives fell to the platters of food, taking\n> large helpings, groaning with pleasure, spilling sauces, and then\n> licking everything up so as not to waste a speck. They looked at her\n> with gratitude and admiration, and Serena felt warm inside, glad that\n> she had at last accomplished something for these poor people.\n>\n> For the first time, Erasmus had tried to do a good deed. Serena hoped\n> to coerce him into doing more.\n>\n> One woman came over and tugged at Serena's sleeve. Serena looked at\n> the large dark eyes, the haggard but hopeful expression. \"What is your\n> name?\" the slave asked. \"We need to know. We will tell others what you\n> have done here.\"\n>\n> \"I am Serena,\" she said. \"Serena Butler. And I have asked Erasmus to\n> improve your living conditions. He will see that you receive better\n> rations every day.\" She turned to look at the robot, narrowing her\n> eyes. \"Isn't that correct?\"\n>\n> The robot gave her a placid, comfortable smile as if content--- not at\n> what he had done, but at the interesting things he had observed. \"As\n> you wish, Serena Butler.\"\n>\n> *Owing to the seductive nature of machines, we assume that\n> technological advances are always improvements and always beneficial\n> to humans.*\n\n--- PRIMERO FAYKAN BUTLER,\n\n*Memoirs of the Jihad*\n\n> **A**fter blaming the failure of his alloy resonator on incompetent\n> solvers, Tio Holtzman abandoned the project without further personal\n> embarrassment. He now realized privately that the generator could\n> never be made selective enough to harm a robotic enemy without\n> significant collateral damage.\n>\n> Somewhat chagrined, Lord Bludd had strongly suggested that his great\n> inventor pursue other concepts. Even so, it had been a promising idea.\n> . . .\n>\n> The scientist returned to his original scrambler field that could\n> disrupt the sophisticated gelcircuitry of thinking machines. Other\n> engineers continued to modify the field-portable scramblers for use in\n> ground assaults, but Holtzman felt there might be more, that the\n> scrambler design could be adapted into a strong barrier against a\n> different sort of weapon.\n>\n> Engrossed in his task, and avoiding Norma (with her irritating\n> tendency to point out his errors), he stared at his calculations. With\n> the goal of increasing the field's power and distribution, he wrestled\n> the equations as if they were living things. He needed to seal the\n> loophole that had allowed the cymeks to penetrate Salusa Secundus.\n>\n> He thought of offensive and defensive weapons at the same time,\n> bouncing them around in his mind like playthings. On general\n> principles, Holtzman knew that *outright destruction* of the enemy\n> would be relatively straightforward, once the League got past Omnius's\n> defenses. Simple bombardment with an overwhelming number of\n> old-fashioned atomic warheads could obliterate the Sychronized\n> Worlds--- but would also kill billions of enslaved human beings. Not a\n> viable solution.\n>\n> In his orrery atop a narrow staircase, Holtzman tapped the hologram\n> image of a large moon that orbited a watery planet. The moon spun out\n> in a long ellipse, escaping the gravitational clutches of its parent\n> planet and careening through the imaginary solar system until it\n> finally collided with another world, destroying both heavenly bodies.\n> He frowned and shut off the image.\n>\n> Yes, destruction was easy enough. Protection was much harder.\n>\n> Holtzman had considered bringing Norma in on his new scheme, but he\n> felt intimidated by the young woman. Despite his earlier successes, he\n> was ashamed that his own mathematical intuition was inferior to hers.\n> She would have been pleased to work beside him, of course, but he felt\n> proprietary toward the concept.

He delivered a sheaf of calculation sheets from the solver\n> teams, the last round of simulation models.\n>\n> Holtzman studied the final numbers, skimming successive calculations.\n> He had worked and reworked his fundamental theory, and his solvers had\n> finally found the answers he needed. Excited, he slapped his palm on\n> the table, scattering piled documents. *Yes!*\n>\n> Pleased, the inventor organized his papers, neatly stacking notes,\n> sketches, and blueprint films. Then he spread out the calculation\n> sheets like a treasure display--- and summoned Norma Cenva. When she\n> came in, he proudly explained what he had done. \"Please--- I invite\n> you to study my results.\"\n>\n> \"I would be happy to, Savant Holtzman.\" Norma evinced no\n> competitiveness, no desire for fame. Holtzman was glad for all of\n> that. But\n>\n> he took a deep breath of trepidation.\n>\n> *I fear her.* He hated the thought, tried to set it aside.\n>\n> She climbed onto a stool, tapping her squarish chin as she pored over\n> the equations. Holtzman walked around his laboratory, flashing glances\n> over his shoulder, but she would not be distracted--- not even when he\n> disturbed a stack of resonating tone prisms.\n>\n> Norma absorbed the new concepts as if she were in a hypnotic trance.\n> He wasn't certain how her mental processes worked, only that they did.\n> Finally she emerged from her alternate world and set the papers aside.\n> \"It is indeed a new form of protective field, Savant. Your\n> manipulation of basic equations is innovative, and even I have\n> difficulty comprehending them in detail.\" She smiled at him, looking\n> very girlish, and he tried not to swell with relief and pride.\n>\n> Then, to his dismay, her tone changed. \"However, I'm not certain that\n> the application you intend will be valid.\"\n>\n> Her words fell like drops of hot lead on his skin. \"What do you mean?\n> The field can disrupt both computer gelcircuitry and physical\n> intrusion.\"\n>\n> Norma ran her fingers across a section of calculations on the third\n> page. \"Your major limiting factor is the radius of effective\n> projection, here and here. No matter how much energy you pump into the\n> shield generator, you cannot expand it beyond a certain constant\n> value. Such a field could protect ships and large buildings---\n> marvelously, in fact--- but it will never scale up to the diameter of\n> a planet.\"\n>\n> \"Can we use multiple small ones, then?\" Holtzman asked in an anxious\n> tone. \"Overlap them?\"\n>\n> \"Maybe,\" Norma agreed, though without enthusiasm. \"But the surprising\n> thing to me is *this*, the velocity variable.\" She circled another\n> part of an equation with her fingertip. \"If you rework the mathematics\n> here\"--- she took a calculation box, rapidly punched a scribe through\n> several openings to\n>\n> engage internal mechanisms, and slid narrow surface plates back and\n> forth ---\"the incident velocity becomes relevant when you separate it\n> as a function of the shield's effectiveness. Thus, at some minimum\n> value for the velocity, the protection factor becomes completely\n> insignificant.\"\n>\n> Holtzman stared, struggling to follow her argument. \"What do you\n> mean?\"\n>\n> Norma was incredibly patient with him. \"In other words, if a\n> projectile moves *slowly enough*, it can penetrate your shields. The\n> shield will stop a fast bullet, but anything slower than a certain\n> critical value passes through.\"\n>\n> \"What sort of enemy fires slow-moving bullets anyway?\" Holtzman said,\n> pulling the papers back toward him. \"Are you afraid someone will be\n> hurt by a tossed apple?\"\n>\n> \"I am simply explaining the ramifications of the mathematics, Savant.\"\n>\n> \"So my shields can protect only small areas, and only against fast\n> projectiles. Is that what you're saying?\"\n>\n> \"Not I, Savant Holtzman. That is what your own equations say.\"\n>\n> \"Well, there must be a practical application. I just wanted to show\n> you my work in progress. I'm sure you'll come up with something much\n> more earth-shattering on your own.\"\n>\n> Norma seemed not to notice his petulance. \"Might I have a copy of\n> this?\"\n>\n> Holtzman frowned at himself for being petty, even unproductive. \"Yes,\n> yes, I'll have the solvers make one for you, while I go into private\n> contemplation. I may be gone for several days.\"\n>\n> \"I'll remain here,\" Norma said, still staring at the mathematics, \"and\n> keep working.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> FLOATING ON THE river aboard a lavish traditional barge, Holtzman\n> paced the airy deck and mulled over possibilities.

When one woman recognized the famous scientist, the\n> whole party invited him to join their table, which he did. After a\n> fine dinner, they shared expensive drinks and reasonably intelligent\n> conversation. He basked in the adulation.\n>\n> But in the middle of the night, unable to sleep, he resumed his work.\n>\n> Clinging to his past successes, remembering when the ideas had flowed\n> so easily, he refused to give up on the new concept. His innovative\n> shields had remarkable potential, but perhaps he was thinking in the\n> wrong paradigm. His canvas was large and his mission vague, but his\n> strokes had been too broad.\n>\n> Why must he worry about armoring an entire planet at a time? Was that\n> really necessary?\n>\n> There were other kinds of warfare: personal combat with ground troops,\n> hand-to-hand battles in which humans could free their captive brothers\n> on the Synchronized Worlds. Massive, planet-wrecking strikes wasted\n> lives. Since an artificial intelligence could copy itself\n> indefinitely, Omnius would never surrender, not even in the face of\n> overwhelming military resistance. The evermind would be nearly\n> impervious . . . unless commando teams could move directly into a\n> machine control center, as they had done on Giedi Prime.\n>\n> Now, as he paced the breezy deck of the river barge, stars glimmered\n> overhead. Holtzman gazed ahead into the sheer rock walls of the Isana\n> canyon, a deep gorge formed by the torrential river. He could hear a\n> whispering rumble of rapids approaching, but knew the barge would\n> steer through a safe channel along one side. He let his mind wander.\n>\n> Smaller shields . . . personal shields. Perhaps the invisible armor\n> would not stop slow projectiles, but they would be proof against most\n> military attacks. And the machines need never know the vulnerability.\n>\n> *Personal shields.*\n>\n> While the success and accolades might be less glorious, the new\n> defensive concept could still prove useful. In fact, it might save\n> billions of lives. People could wear the shields for personal\n> protection. Individuals, like tiny fortresses, could be made nearly\n> impervious to attack.\n>\n> Breathless, he returned to his luxurious cabin on the upper deck of\n> the barge, the interior of which was illuminated by one of Norma's\n> faceted glowglobes. Far into the night, he wrote and rewrote his\n> equations. Finally he studied his results with bleary, grainy eyes and\n> proudly labeled them the \"Holtzman Effect.\"\n>\n> *Yes, this will do nicely indeed.*\n>\n> He would summon a fast transport and return to Starda, downriver.

The young men worked far from the listening overseers,\n> without any hope of escape. They had no place to go except down the\n> rock face to the frothing waters far below.\n>\n> The abrasive knife of the Isana had sliced a steep gorge, leaving\n> stone walls so flat and polished that no weed or bush could gain a\n> roothold. Though the river was fast and the waters treacherous, this\n> bottleneck was part of the vital trade route downriver. Floating\n> barges from the continental flatlands--- loaded with cargoes of grain,\n> fermented grass juices, flowers, and local spices--- passed through\n> the gorge.\n>\n> Lord Bludd had decided to put up a giant mosaic on a canyon wall, a\n> titanic mural to commemorate the triumphs of his noble family. The\n> northern end of the artwork began with idealized depictions of his\n> ancestor Sajak Bludd, while the southern expanse remained an immense\n> virgin slate for the accomplishments of future Poritrin lords.\n>\n> Ishmael, Aliid, and their companions were forced to build the mosaic.\n> A pattern had already been laser-etched onto the walls by artists, and\n> the boys methodically placed tiles over the design, each piece a tiny\n> pixel of what would ultimately become a colorful display. Scaffolds\n> hung down, laden with geometric tiles cut from fired river clay and\n> glazed with gem-based tints imported from Hagal.\n>\n> Seen from the decks of boats far below, the mural would be\n> breathtaking. But suspended in a harness up close, Ishmael could not\n> identify details. He saw only a blurry honeycomb of tiles, one color\n> after another laid down with foul-smelling epoxies.\n>\n> In a sling beside him, Aliid noisily trimmed tiles to fit into place.\n> Machine sounds ricocheted across the canyon: rock saws, pointed\n> hammers, power chisels. Lamenting his stolen life, Aliid sang a song\n> from IV Anbus as he worked. Ishmael joined in with a similar ballad\n> about Harmonthep.\n>\n> Hanging ten meters below in his own harness, a boy named Ebbin\n> composed an impromptu musical chant describing his home of Souci, a\n> habitable moon so isolated that neither Aliid nor Ishmael had heard of\n> it. The Tlulaxa slavers, it seemed, were adept at finding lost\n> Buddislamic refugees, persecuting Zensunnis and Zenshiites alike.\n>\n> On the long ropes and harnesses, boys proved more agile and energetic\n> than grown men or women. They could scramble over the granite to lay\n> down colored tiles while cool winds whistled through the canyon. The\n> overseers expected no trouble.\n>\n> They were wrong.\n>\n> With simmering resentment, Aliid often repeated the defiant words of\n> Bel Moulay. The fiery Zenshiite leader dreamed of a time when slaves\n> could throw off their chains and live free again, returning to IV\n> Anbus or Harmonthep or even mysterious Souci. Ishmael listened to the\n> foolish talk, but didn't want to add kindling to Aliid's fire.\n>\n> Remembering his compassionate grandfather, Ishmael remained a patient\n> pacifist. He realized that it might take longer than his own lifespan\n> before the slavers were overthrown. Aliid did not want to wait. He\n> felt the slaves deserved revenge, as dark-bearded Bel Moulay promised\n> in his impassioned speeches. . . .\n>\n> Across the canyon, the flamboyant Lord Bludd arrived at the viewing\n> platform with his noble entourage. The Lord's own concepts and\n> sketches had been adapted to the canyon wall by court artists, and he\n> made regular pilgrimages to inspect the work. Each week, the viewing\n> platform was moved down the canyon as the immense mosaic grid crawled\n> slowly along the granite cliffs. Flanked by golden Dragoon guards, the\n> nobleman congratulated the project masters.\n>\n> Currently, the mural showed how his great-grandfather, Favo Bludd, had\n> created unique artwork out in the great grassy plains, geometric\n> designs of flowers and weeds that bloomed in different seasons. When\n> seen from the air, these transient art pieces changed like\n> kaleidoscopic images. Each season the flowers grew in patterns, then\n> went to seed and gradually formed more random congregations as winds\n> disturbed the planter's palette.\n>\n> From where Bludd watched, surrounded by mumbling sycophants, the slave\n> boys looked like insects crawling along the opposite wall. He heard\n> their equipment noises and the faint, high tones of young voices.\n>\n> The work was progressing well. Giant figures, faces, and starships\n> covered the granite: an epic depiction of the settlement of Poritrin\n> and the intentional destruction of all computers, which returned the\n> planet to a bucolic existence, dependent upon slave labor.\n>\n> A man of great pride, Bludd knew the faces of his ancestors well.\n> Unfortunately, as he studied the interplay of light and color on the\n> unfinished mosaic, he found himself dissatisfied with the face of old\n> Favo. Though the mosaic pattern precisely followed the image that had\n> been laser-etched onto the granite, now that he saw the result larger\n> than life, Niko Bludd was not pleased. \"Look at the face of Lord Favo.\n> Do you agree that it is inaccurate?\"\n>\n> Everyone in his party concurred immediately. He called over the\n> project supervisor, explained the problem, and ordered removal of the\n> tiles on the face of Favo Bludd, pending a redesign of his features.\n>\n> The work boss hesitated for just a moment, then nodded.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> DANGLING IN THEIR harnesses, Ishmael and Aliid let out simultaneous\n> groans as the outrageous instructions came down.

Ishmael hung before\n> the huge geometric pattern that formed the eye of the old nobleman.\n>\n> Angrily, Aliid set his protective goggles in place, then swung a rock\n> hammer to smash the tiles, as instructed. Alongside his friend,\n> Ishmael chipped and pounded. Ironically, removing the tiles was more\n> difficult than installing them in the first place. The epoxy was\n> harder than the granite itself, so they had no choice but to shatter\n> the mosaic and let the shards tumble down into the river.\n>\n> Aliid groused at the pointlessness of their labors. Being a slave was\n> bad enough, but it infuriated him to redo massive work because some\n> arrogant master changed his mind. He swung his hammer harder than\n> necessary, as if envisioning the heads of his enemies--- and the\n> ricochet was enough to knock the tool loose from his grip. The hammer\n> fell, and he yelled, \"Look out below!\"\n>\n> Young Ebbin tried to scramble out of the way, his feet and arms\n> slipping as he moved across the polished rock. The hammer clipped him\n> on the shoulder, slicing the torso strap of his harness.\n>\n> Ebbin slipped, one-half of his support cut away, his collarbone\n> broken. He screamed and scrabbled, grabbing at the remaining harness\n> loop that dug into his right underarm. His feet slid on the polished\n> mosaic tiles.\n>\n> Ishmael tried to move sideways so that he could reach the taut cable\n> that held Ebbin. Aliid worked just as hard to drop down to where he\n> could support the boy from Souci.\n>\n> Ebbin kicked and thrashed. He dropped his own hammer, letting it fall\n> to the foamy ribbon of water far below. Ishmael grabbed the boy's\n> single remaining rope and held it, but didn't know what else to do.\n>\n> Above, slaves along the canyon rim began to haul on the cable, lifting\n> the struggling boy. But Ebbin's left arm hung limp, and with a broken\n> clavicle he could do little to help himself. The cable snagged on a\n> rock burr. Ishmael pulled the rope in an attempt to free it, his teeth\n> clenched.

Ishmael\n> heard a snap as the rope broke far above.\n>\n> The line in his hand went limp, and Ishmael lurched wildly, grasping\n> at his harness. The fibrous cord that held Ebbin spun through his\n> clenched palm, burning skin. Ebbin reached up, in spite of his injury,\n> and his fingers barely missed Ishmael's. Then the boy dropped free,\n> his mouth open wide, his eyes bright and disbelieving.

After catching the\n> crew boss at his attempted treachery, Ajax had clamped a free-formed\n> artificial hand around the man's right bicep and dragged him away from\n> his workers, screaming and stumbling.\n>\n> The slaves had stopped their tasks, looking with horror and pity at\n> their supervisor, now fallen to the wrath of Ajax. The cymek paraded\n> with his terrified captive through the monument-shadowed streets and\n> finally carried him into a hollow building. With squared-off facades\n> and ornate stone-work, the structure was called the Hall of Justice.\n>\n> That seemed infinitely appropriate to Ajax.\n>\n> Like so many grand edifices of Earth's central city grid, the Hall of\n> Justice was merely a stage set designed to convey a sense of majesty\n> and grandeur. Inside, the hall was an empty shell without facilities,\n> only a floor of plazcrete.\n>\n> Ajax and the traitor could be alone here for a lengthy private\n> interrogation. The very idea of a revolt among the slaves amused him\n> with its na\u00efve absurdity, especially the possibility that a trustee\n> would add his support to such nonsense.\n>\n> With a thoughtrode impulse, he focused his myriad optic threads on the\n> whimpering captive. The terrified man had soiled himself and sobbed\n> pathetically, making more excuses than denials. No need to hurry. Best\n> to play this out for his own enjoyment.\n>\n> \"You plotted to overthrow the rule of thinking machines.\" Ajax kept\n> his voice firm and deep. \"Concocting tales of a widespread underground\n> resistance, with the foolish aim of making slaves rise up and somehow\n> gain a fairytale independence from Omnius.\"\n>\n> \"It's not true!\" the man wailed. \"I swear I didn't know what I was\n> doing. I was following instructions. I received messages---\"\n>\n> \"You received messages commanding you to commit sedition, and did not\n> report them to me?\" Ajax's ominous laugh made the poor fellow wet\n> himself. \"Instead, you surreptitiously passed the word among your work\n> crews.\"\n>\n> The evidence of sedition was incontrovertible, and Ajax expected to be\n> rewarded for dealing with the problem. Omnius was watching, after all.\n> Perhaps, the cymek thought, if he ferreted out the core of this\n> budding rebellion, he could claim a reward, even demand the\n> opportunity to fight in a spectacular gladiatorial combat, as\n> Barbarossa and Agamemnon had done.\n>\n> \"We must record this properly.\" Ajax strode forward on flexible\n> armored legs, swaying sets of exaggerated insectlike arms. He grabbed\n> the captive's left wrist and clamped down with a polymer-metal grasp.\n> \"Tell us your name.\"\n>\n> The trustee blubbered and pleaded, trying to flinch away. In a twinge\n> of anger, Ajax clenched his powerful gripper and snipped off the\n> sobbing captive's hand at the wrist. The man screamed, and blood\n> spurted, much of it raining onto the cymek's front set of optic\n> threads. Ajax cursed to himself. He had not meant to inflict so much\n> pain before the human even had the chance to answer simple questions.\n>\n> While the crew boss howled and thrashed, Ajax activated a hot blue\n> flamer and scorched the end of the severed wrist, crisping the stump.\n> \"There, it's cauterized.\" Ajax waited for the man to show some hint of\n> gratitude. \"Now answer the question. What is your name?\"\n>\n> Shaping another menacing claw from his flowing metal limb-tip, Ajax\n> grasped the man's other hand. The crew boss wailed unrelentingly, but\n> had the presence of mind to say, \"*Ohan*. Ohan Freer! That's my name.\n> Please, don't hurt me again.\"\n>\n> \"A good start.\" Ajax knew, though, that the hurting had just begun. He\n> especially enjoyed this part of his job, when he could improvise pain\n> and inflict it like a master designer.\n>\n> Some of the other Titans considered Ajax a loose cannon. But if a\n> leader couldn't show a little domination over a vanquished people,\n> what was the point of taking over the Old Empire in the first place?\n> Even in their glory days, Ajax had never been interested, like Xerxes,\n> in extravagant food and drink, or in a pampered lifestyle with toys\n> and pleasures like his own spoiled mate, Hecate.\n>\n> No, Ajax had joined the team for the sheer challenge of it. Early on,\n> when Tlaloc had made plans with his fellow conspirators, seductive\n> Juno had recruited Ajax to their cause. A tough and aggressive\n> fighter, Ajax had provided the muscle the Titans needed--- not just\n> physical strength, but the mindset of a warrior, a relentless\n> conqueror. Following the initial overthrow of the humans, he had done\n> his best to maintain order, regardless of the cost in the blood of\n> noncombatants.\n>\n> The vermin invariably attempted one uprising or another, but Ajax\n> easily extinguished these little brushfires. When the more organized\n> Hrethgir Rebellions threatened the Titans, Ajax had responded with\n> astonishing mayhem. He had gone to Walgis, the site of the rebellion's\n> initial sparks, and closed off the planet from space transportation.\n> He'd made a point of leaving communications open so that the doomed\n> populace could scream\n>\n> for help. That way, restless slaves on other Titan-controlled worlds\n> could experience the punishment vicariously.\n>\n> Then he set to work.\n>\n> The essential job had taken years, but Ajax finally succeeded in\n> exterminating every living human on Walgis--- committing most of the\n> murder with atomics, poison gas clouds, and customized diseases. To\n> finish off the survivors, Ajax had installed his brain canister inside\n> a monstrous and intimidating body and hunted the humans down like wild\n> animals. Accompanied by squads of Barbarossa's programmed robots, he\n> had burned cities, smashed buildings, ferreted out any human presence.\n> He killed every last one of the *hrethgir*, and enjoyed it\n> immeasurably.\n>\n> Truly, those had been the glory days of the Titans!\n>\n> The violence, however justified, had troubled his mate Hecate, the\n> weakest and most squeamish of the original twenty. Although she had\n> joined Tlaloc's rebellion to earn rewards for herself, she'd never\n> understood the necessities of the job and had gradually wilted from\n> it. After the Titans had sacrificed their human bodies in favor of an\n> immortal existence as cymeks, Hecate had remained with Ajax, all the\n> while trying unsuccessfully to change his personality. Despite their\n> disagreements, Ajax had been fond of her, though his need for a lover\n> had vanished with his physical form.\n>\n> Appalled at Ajax's bloodthirsty response to the Hrethgir Rebellions,\n> Hecate had \"resigned\" her position among the Titans. She wanted\n> nothing more to do with ruling humanity. Encased in a cymek body of\n> her own design, a long-range space vessel, Hecate simply departed,\n> leaving the remaining Titans to continue their death grip on humanity.\n>\n> Ironically, Hecate had chosen the perfect time to leave. Not long\n> after the obliteration of humans on Walgis, Xerxes's fatal error had\n> allowed the Omnius evermind to get loose. . . .\n>\n> Now, inside the blood-spattered Hall of Justice, Ajax raised his\n> intimidating body high. He powered up his systems so that neurelectric\n> fire gleamed\n>\n> through his insectlike limbs.\n>\n> The captive traitor screamed at the very thought of what was about to\n> happen to him.\n>\n> \"Now, Ohan Freer,\" Ajax said, \"let me ask you certain other questions.\n> I want you to pay close attention.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> BY COMMAND OF Omnius, the crew boss Iblis Ginjo brought his loyal\n> slaves into the Golden Age Square. Ajax was about to pronounce\n> sentence\n>\n> --- execution, no doubt--- upon a man he had taken captive, a crew\n> boss from another labor gang, Ohan Freer.\n>\n> Iblis had trained with the accused trustee in the special schools, but\n> he had never seen his fellow crew boss do anything illegal. Ajax\n> rarely needed much of an excuse, however. He himself had experienced\n> the Titan's displeasure more than once, but so far had managed to\n> survive. He doubted his compatriot would fare as well today.\n>\n> An ornate metal-worked column stood in the center of the square. A\n> roaring orange flame gushed from the top of the pillar, like an\n> ornamental smokestack. Fanciful facades of immense buildings, all\n> empty, surrounded the plaza like prison walls around a central\n> courtyard. Omnius's sentinel robots looked powerful and portentous in\n> formations along the sides of the square, ready to strike against any\n> perceived infraction by the expendable human slaves.\n>\n> Iblis guided his crew into the partitioned viewing areas, voicing a\n> few words of reassurance, though not enough to upset the cymeks. Ajax\n> loved showmanship, wanted to make certain every terrified eye\n> witnessed his actions. When Iblis and the other crew bosses blew\n> whistles to signal their readiness, Ajax emerged, carrying his maimed\n> prisoner.\n>\n> The Titan wore an antlike body with an impressive ellipsoidal core,\n> heavy walking legs, and four grasping arms in which he held Ohan\n> Freer.\n>\n> Hovering watcheyes captured images and fed a steady stream of data to\n> the evermind.\n>\n> Beneath the flaming pillar, Ajax clutched the squirming victim like a\n> giant ant soldier with a hapless enemy beetle. Doomed Ohan had been\n> burned, bloodied, and wounded; his left hand was only a charred stump.\n> Blossoming bruises discolored his skin. A thin, watery wail leaked\n> from his mouth.\n>\n> A mutter of dismay came from the human onlookers. Watching them, Iblis\n> knew these workers could not have been the source of the rebellion,\n> despite the mysterious and provocative messages he had received. What\n> if he was deluding himself and the secret call to freedom was simply a\n> wishful suggestion voiced by another desperate person?\n>\n> Lifting the unfortunate captive high, Ajax amplified his vocal\n> synthesizers so that his words boomed like a projectile cannon around\n> the enclosed square. \"Some of you have heard this criminal speak. Some\n> of you may have had the poor judgment to listen to his silly\n> imaginings about freedom and rebellion. You would be wiser to cut off\n> your ears than listen to such foolishness.\"\n>\n> The crowd held its collective breath. Iblis bit his lower lip, not\n> wanting to watch, but fixated on the imminent horror. If he averted\n> his gaze, the watcheyes might well detect it, and he would hear about\n> it later. As a consequence, Iblis stared at every unfolding second.\n>\n> \"This poor, deluded man is no longer necessary to the continued glory\n> of Omnius in the reign of the thinking machines.\"\n>\n> Ohan screamed, and struggled weakly. Ajax held the man's intact arm in\n> one roughly formed pincer claw and each leg in two others. With his\n> last claw, Ajax wrapped a long, sharp embrace around Ohan's chest,\n> under his armpits.\n>\n> \"He is no longer a worker. He is no longer even *hrethgir*, one of the\n> unruly humans who survive at our own sufferance. He is *garbage*.\"\n> Ajax paused.\n>\n> \"And garbage is to be discarded.\"\n>\n> Then, without a sound or any sign of effort, Ajax pulled his\n> artificial limbs in different directions, tearing the helpless Ohan\n> asunder. The man's arms and legs ripped free, his chest tore open and\n> broken bones pierced skin. Blood and entrails spilled onto the clean\n> flagstones of the Golden Age Square.\n>\n> Ajax flung the bloody parts into the screaming crowd. \"Enough of this\n> nonsense! There is no rebellion. Now get back to work.\"\n>\n> The sickened workers seemed only too eager to race back to their\n> tasks, looking to Iblis as they left, as if he could protect them. But\n> Iblis still stared in disbelieving amazement. Ohan Freer had been a\n> member of the rebellion! The crew boss had spread dissent, made plans,\n> perhaps sent and received messages.\n>\n> *Another rebel!*\n>\n> Appalled, Iblis knew the danger to himself was even greater now, if he\n> continued to act. Nonetheless, today's execution had shown him one\n> thing more clearly than ever: The brewing human rebellion was not just\n> his imagination.\n>\n> *It is real!*\n>\n> If Ohan had been part of it, then there must be others, too--- many of\n> them. This underground network of fighters, which included Iblis, was\n> safely separated into cells so that no one could betray the others.\n> Now he understood.\n>\n> He began to make plans with even greater conviction than before.\n>\n> *Humans deny a continuum of possibilities, an infinite number of\n> realms into which their species may enter.*\n>\n> --- ERASMUS,\n\nnotes on human nature\n\n> **I**t was a makeshift performance hall, inside a marble-walled\n> building on the robot's estate. Erasmus had worked his slave crews to\n> modify the interior, install seats, and retool the walls, all to\n> create perfect acoustics for this single performance. Erasmus had\n> studied records of the greatest human classical music, knew exactly\n> what was expected of grand symphonies, from the audience to the\n> setting. He had high standards for his artistic endeavors.\n>\n> The robot invited Serena Butler, now in her eighth month of pregnancy,\n> to sit in a large central chair for the concert. \"These other people\n> might experience pleasure from the melody and the sounds, but you have\n> different expectations. On Salusa Secundus, sophisticated music was a\n> part of your existence.\"\n>\n> With a pang, Serena thought of her brother and his musical\n> aspirations. She had learned to appreciate the enduring works of\n> long-vanished human composers. \"Music is not the only thing I miss,\n> Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \"You and I speak the same cultured language,\" he said, not noticing\n> her pointed remark. \"You will tell me how you enjoy this composition.\n> I had you in mind when I wrote it.\"\n>\n> He filled the performance hall with worker-caste slaves culled from a\n> variety of skilled labor assignments. They were cleaned up and dressed\n> according to Erasmus's concept of a high-class audience.\n>\n> Electronic portraits of great human composers lined the interior\n> walls, as if the robot wanted to count himself among their number.\n> Around the perimeter of the concert hall, museum-type display cases\n> held musical\n>\n> instruments--- a lute, a rebec, a gilded tambour, and an antique\n> fifteen-string baliset with inlaid vabalone shells on its case.\n>\n> In the center of the mezzanine stage beneath open rafters, Erasmus sat\n> alone before a grand piano, surrounded by music synthesizers,\n> speakers, and a sound-misting station. Wearing a formal black suit\n> with a cut similar to a tuxedo but redesigned to accommodate his\n> robotic body, Erasmus sat at attention, his face a smooth mirrored\n> oval, showing no expression.\n>\n> Shifting to find a more comfortable position for her back, Serena\n> watched the inquisitor robot. She rested a hand on her enormous\n> abdomen, felt the movements of the restless baby. Within weeks, she\n> would deliver her child.\n>\n> Around her, the captive audience shifted uneasily, not sure what to\n> expect, or what was expected of them. Erasmus turned his mirrored face\n> toward the audience, reflecting them as he waited, and waited. Finally\n> silence fell.\n>\n> \"Thank you for your attention.\" He turned to a shiny silver apparatus\n> beside him, a music synthesizer with dancing polymer fingertips that\n> produced familiar riffs and chords. The background music increased in\n> volume, laced with stringed instruments and mournful Chusuk horns.\n>\n> The robot listened for several moments, then continued, \"You are about\n> to experience something truly remarkable. To demonstrate my respect\n> for the creative spirit, I have composed a new symphony especially for\n> you, my hardworking slaves. No human has ever heard it before.\"\n>\n> He played a rapid mixture of melodies on the piano, running through\n> three short passages in an apparent effort to confirm that the\n> instrument was tuned properly. \"After detailed analysis of the field,\n> I have written a symphony comparable to the works of the great human\n> composers Johannes Brahms and Emi Chusuk. I developed my piece\n> according to strict principles of order and mathematics.\"\n>\n> Serena perused the audience, doubting any of the humans raised in\n> captivity were familiar with the classical music the robot had\n> mentioned. Schooled on Salusa Secundus, where music and art were\n> integral parts of the culture,\n>\n> Serena had listened to the renowned works of many composers, even\n> discussing them at length with Fredo.\n>\n> With a mental pulse Erasmus linked his gelcircuitry mind to the\n> synthesizer, producing a strange, repetitious melody. Then his\n> mechanical fingers danced over the keyboard, and he made frequent\n> sweeping gestures as he played, as if imitating a famous concert\n> pianist.\n>\n> Serena found the composition pleasant enough, but unremarkable. And,\n> although she did not recognize the precise melody, it had a strangely\n> familiar character, as if the robot had mathematically analyzed an\n> existing piece measure by measure and followed the pattern, changing a\n> rhythm here, a polyphonic passage there. The music felt lackluster,\n> with no powerful driving force.\n>\n> Erasmus apparently believed it was a human instinct to appreciate a\n> new work, that his captive audience would intrinsically note the\n> nuances and complexities of his structurally perfect composition. The\n> slaves around Serena shifted in their seats and listened; to them,\n> this was a pleasant enough diversion but just another work assignment.\n> The conscripted audience seemed to enjoy the soothing notes of the\n> melody, but it did not move them in the way the robot desired.\n>\n> When at last he ceased his performance, Erasmus sat back from the\n> piano, deactivated the symphonic support equipment, and let the\n> silence deepen. The reverberating tones faded.\n>\n> For a moment, the slaves hesitated as if waiting for instructions.\n> Erasmus said, \"You may give an ovation if you enjoyed the piece.\" They\n> didn't seem to understand the reference, until he said, \"Signify by\n> clapping your hands.\"\n>\n> An initial wave of applause came as a sparse patter like raindrops,\n> then swelled into louder clapping--- as was expected of them. Serena\n> joined in politely, though not enthusiastically. A small act of\n> honesty that she was sure Erasmus would notice.\n>\n> The robot's shining mask had shifted into a proud smile. In his formal\n> black garment he walked smoothly down a staircase from the mezzanine\n> stage to the main floor. The slaves continued to applaud, and he\n> basked in the apparent adulation. When the acclamation receded, he\n> summoned sentinel guards to escort the audience back to their regular\n> work assignments.\n>\n> Serena could see that Erasmus believed he had created an enduring work\n> of merit that possibly surpassed what humans had achieved. But she\n> didn't want to discuss it with him, and tried to slip away to her\n> greenhouse work. She moved slowly because of her pregnancy, however,\n> and Erasmus caught up with her. \"Serena Butler, I wrote this symphony\n> for your benefit. Are you not impressed by it?\"\n>\n> She selected her words carefully, avoiding a candid answer. \"Perhaps I\n> am simply sad because your symphony reminds me of other performances I\n> watched on Salusa Secundus. My late brother wanted to be a musician.\n> Those were happier times for me.\"\n>\n> He looked at her closely, his optic threads sparkling. \"Nuances of\n> human behavior tell me that my symphony has disappointed you. Explain\n> why.\"\n>\n> \"You don't want an honest opinion.\"\n>\n> \"You misjudge me, for I am a seeker of truth. Anything else is faulty\n> data.\" His cherubic expression caused her to lower her guard. \"Is\n> there something wrong with the acoustics in this hall?\"\n>\n> \"It's nothing to do with the acoustics. I'm sure you tested everything\n> to technical perfection.\" The audience continued to move toward the\n> exits, some looking over their shoulders at Serena with pity that the\n> robot had taken a special interest in her. \"It was the symphony\n> itself.\"\n>\n> \"Continue,\" Erasmus said. His voice was flat.\n>\n> \"You assembled that piece, you didn't *create* it. It was based on\n> precise models developed ages ago by human composers. The only\n> creativity I heard came from their minds, not yours. Your music was a\n> mathematical\n>\n> extrapolation, but nothing that inspired me in any way. The tune you .\n> . .*engineered* evoked no images or feelings within me. There was no\n> fresh element that you contributed, nothing emotionally compelling.\"\n>\n> \"How am I to quantify such an ingredient?\"\n>\n> Forcing a smile, Serena shook her head. \"Therein lies your mistake,\n> Erasmus. It is impossible to quantify creativity. How does a person\n> hear a thunderstorm and use that experience to write the 'William Tell\n> Overture'? You would simply imitate the sounds of thunder and rain,\n> Erasmus, but you wouldn't *evoke the impression* of a storm. How did\n> Beethoven look at a peaceful meadow and adapt that experience into his\n> 'Pastorale'? Music should make the spirit soar, take the breath away,\n> touch the soul. Your work was just . . . pleasant tones, adequately\n> performed.\"\n>\n> The robot took several seconds to change the expression on his face,\n> and finally looked at her with perplexity, even defensiveness. \"Your\n> opinion seems to be in the minority. The rest of the audience greatly\n> appreciated the work. Did you not notice their applause?\"\n>\n> She sighed. \"First of all, those slaves have no knowledge of music, no\n> basis of comparison. You could have stolen any symphony from a\n> classical composer, note for note, and called it your own. They\n> wouldn't have known the difference.\n>\n> \"Second, sitting in a concert hall--- comfortable, clean, and\n> well-dressed--- is probably the best work assignment you've ever given\n> them. Why wouldn't they clap for that reason alone?\"\n>\n> She looked at him. \"Finally, and most important, you *told* them to\n> applaud. How are they supposed to react, when they know you could have\n> them killed at any moment? Under such circumstances, Erasmus, you will\n> never get a fair and honest response.\"\n>\n> \"I do not understand, cannot understand.\" Erasmus repeated this\n> several times. Abruptly, he whirled and swung a hardened fist into the\n> face of a\n>\n> man who walked past. The unexpected blow sent the victim crashing over\n> the chairs, bleeding.\n>\n> \"Why did you do that?\" Serena demanded, rushing over to help the man.\n>\n> \"Artistic temperament,\" Erasmus said calmly. \"Is that not what humans\n> call it? He tried to deceive me about how he really felt.\"\n>\n> She tried to soothe the man, but when he looked up to see the robot,\n> the slave struggled away, holding a hand up to stop the blood dripping\n> from his nose. Serena rounded on Erasmus. \"True artists are sensitive\n> and compassionate. They don't need to *hurt* people to make them\n> feel.\"\n>\n> \"You are not afraid to voice your opinion, even when you believe it\n> might displease me?\"\n>\n> Serena looked directly into his unnatural face. \"You hold me prisoner,\n> Erasmus. You claim to want my opinion, so I give it. You can hurt me,\n> even murder me, but you have already taken me away from my life and\n> the man I love. Any further pain pales in comparison.\"\n>\n> Erasmus stared at her, assessing what she had said. \"Humans are\n> perplexing to me--- and you more than anyone, Serena Butler.\" His\n> flowmetal countenance took on a smiling expression. \"But I will keep\n> trying to understand. Thank you for your insights.\"\n>\n> As Serena left the hall, Erasmus returned to the piano and began\n> practicing.\n>\n> *Above all, I am a man of honor. This is how I wish to be remembered.*\n\n--- XAVIER HARKONNEN,\n\ncomment to his men\n", "metadata": {}, "type": null, "config": {}, "parent": null, "children": [], "start": 1948, "end": 16967, "full_body": "> so that we may plan a strike against Omnius.\"\n>\n> \"It's about time,\" Ajax said, his voice a deep grumble.\n>\n> \"Do you believe the evermind has grown complacent, my love--- like the\n> humans of the Old Empire?\" Juno asked.\n>\n> \"I have noted no particular sign of weakness,\" Dante interjected, \"and\n> I keep careful track of such things.\"\n>\n> \"There are always weaknesses,\" Ajax said, twitching one of his heavy\n> armored legs and gouging a hole in the ground, \"*if* you're willing to\n> use enough muscle to exploit them.\"\n>\n> Barbarossa clacked one of his metal forelegs on the hard rock. \"Do not\n> be fooled by artificial intelligence.

One day I'll let him become a\n> cymek.\"\n>\n> Ajax interrupted, his voice pitched low, \"We cannot fight two major\n> enemies at once. Since Omnius has finally allowed us to attack the\n> *hrethgir,*\n>\n> thanks to Barbarossa's victory in the gladiator ring, I say we\n> prosecute that war to the best of our abilities. Afterward, we deal\n> with Omnius.\"\n>\n> Immersed in the crater shadows, the cymeks muttered, half-agreeing.\n> The League humans had escaped Titan rule centuries ago, and the old\n> cymeks had always harbored a hatred toward them. Dante's optic threads\n> tracked back and forth, calculating. \"Yes, the humans should be easier\n> to defeat.\"\n>\n> \"Meanwhile, we continue to seek a means to eliminate Omnius,\"\n> Barbarossa added. \"Everything in its time.\"\n>\n> \"Perhaps you are correct,\" Agamemnon admitted. The cymek general did\n> not want to extend this clandestine gathering much longer.\n>\n> He led the march back to their individual ships. \"We destroy the\n> League humans first. Using that as a springboard, we then turn our\n> attention to the more difficult foe.\"\n>\n> *Logic is blind and often knows only its own past.*\n>\n> --- archives from *Genetics to Philosophy,*\n>\n> compiled by the Sorceresses of Rossak\n>\n> **T**hinking machines cared little for aesthetics, but the Omnius\n> update ship was--- by accident of design--- a beautifully sleek\n> silver-and-black vessel, dwarfed by the immensity of the cosmos as it\n> journeyed from one Synchronized World to another. Finished with its\n> current round of updates, the *Dream Voyager* was on its way back to\n> Earth.\n>\n> Vorian Atreides considered himself fortunate to be entrusted with such\n> a vital assignment. Born from a female slave impregnated with\n> Agamemnon's preserved sperm, dark-haired Vorian could trace his\n> lineage back past the Time of Titans, thousands of years to the House\n> of Atreus in ancient Greece and another famous Agamemnon. Because of\n> his father's status, twenty-year-old Vor had been raised and\n> indoctrinated on Earth under the thinking machines. He was one of the\n> privileged \"trustee\" humans permitted to move about freely, serving\n> Omnius.\n>\n> He had read all the stories of his illustrious bloodline in the\n> extensive memoirs his father had written to document his triumphs. Vor\n> considered the Titan general's great work to be more than a literary\n> masterpiece, closer to a holy historical document.\n>\n> Just forward of Vor's work station, the *Dream Voyager*'s captain, an\n> autonomous robot, checked instruments unerringly. Seurat's\n> coppery-metal skinfilm flowed over a man-shaped body of polymer\n> struts, alloy supports, gelcircuitry processors, and wound\n> elastic-weave musculature.\n>\n> While Seurat studied the instruments, he intermittently tapped into\n> the ship's long-range scanners or looked out the windowport with\n> focused optic threads. Multiprocessing as he conversed, the robot\n> captain continued the interplay with his subservient human copilot.\n> Seurat had a strange and unfortunate penchant for telling odd jokes.\n>\n> \"Vorian, what do you get when you breed a pig with a human?\"\n>\n> \"What?\"\n>\n> \"A creature that still eats a great deal, still stinks, and still does\n> no work!\"\n>\n> Vorian favored the captain with a polite chuckle. Most of the time,\n> Seurat's jokes only demonstrated that the robot did not truly\n> understand humor. But if Vor didn't laugh, Seurat would simply tell\n> another one, and another, until he obtained the desired reaction.\n> \"Aren't you afraid you'll make an error by telling jokes while\n> monitoring our navigation systems?\"\n>\n> \"I don't make mistakes,\" Seurat said, in his staccato mechanical\n> voice.\n>\n> Vor brightened with the challenge. \"Ah, but what if I sabotaged one of\n> the ship's vital functions? We're the only ones aboard, and I *am* a\n> deceitful human after all, your mortal enemy. It would serve you right\n> for all those terrible jokes.\"\n>\n> \"I might expect that of a lowly slave or even an artisan worker, but\n> *you* would never do that, Vorian. You have too much to lose.\" With an\n> eerily smooth movement, Seurat turned his rippled coppery head, paying\n> even less attention to the *Dream Voyager*'s controls. \"And even if\n> you did, I would figure it out.\"\n>\n> \"Don't underestimate me, old Metalmind. My father teaches me that,\n> despite our many weaknesses, we humans have a trump card with our very\n> unpredictability.\" Smiling, Vorian went to the robot captain's side\n> and studied the metric screens. \"Why do you think Omnius asks me to\n> throw a wrench into his careful simulations every time he plans an\n> encounter with the *hrethgir*?\"\n>\n> \"Your outrageous and reckless chaos is the only reason you are able to\n> beat me in any strategy game,\" Seurat said. \"It certainly has nothing\n> to do with your innate skills.\"\n>\n> \"A winner has more skills than a loser,\" Vor said, \"no matter how you\n> define the competition.\"\n>\n> The update ship traveled on a regular, continuous route throughout the\n> Synchronized Worlds. One of fifteen such vessels, the *Dream Voyager*\n> carried copies of the current version of Omnius to synchronize the\n> separate computer everminds on widely separated planets.\n>\n> Circuitry limitations and electronic transmission speeds constrained\n> the physical size of any individual machine; thus, the same computer\n> evermind could not viably extend beyond a single planet. Nonetheless,\n> duplicate copies of Omnius existed everywhere, like mental clones.\n> With regular updates continually exchanged by ships like the *Dream\n> Voyager*, all the separate Omnius incarnations remained virtually\n> identical across the machine-dominated autarchy.\n>\n> After many voyages, Vor knew how to operate the ship and could access\n> all onboard data banks using Seurat's codes. Over the years, he and\n> the robot captain had become fast friends in a way that others were\n> not likely to understand. Because of the extended time they shared in\n> deep space, talking about many things, playing games of skill, telling\n> stories--- they bridged much of the gap between machine and man.\n>\n> Sometimes, for amusement, Vor and Seurat traded places, and Vor\n> pretended to be the captain of the ship, while Seurat became his\n> robotic underling, as in the days of the Old Empire. During one\n> role-playing session, Vorian had impulsively christened the ship\n> *Dream Voyager*, a bit of poetic nonsense that Seurat not only\n> tolerated, but maintained.\n>\n> As a sentient machine, Seurat routinely received new instructions and\n> memory transfers from the overall Omnius brain, but because he spent\n> so much time disconnected while journeying between the stars, he had\n> developed his own personality and independence. In Vor's opinion,\n> Seurat was the best of the machine minds, although the robot could be\n> irritating at times. Especially with that peculiar sense of humor.\n>\n> Vor clasped his hands and cracked his knuckles. He sighed with\n> pleasure. \"Sure feels good to loosen up. Too bad it's something you\n> can't do.\"\n>\n> \"I do not require loosening up.\"\n>\n> Vorian didn't admit that he, too, found his own organic body to be\n> inferior in many ways, fragile and prone to aches, sicknesses, and\n> injuries that any machine could have easily fixed. He hoped that his\n> physical form would remain functional long enough for him to be made\n> into one of the enduring neo-cymeks, all of whom had once been valued\n> trustee humans, like himself. One day Agamemnon would receive\n> permission from Omnius for that, if Vor worked very hard to serve the\n> evermind.\n>\n> The *Dream Voyager* had been in space on a long update run, and the\n> young trustee was glad to be going home. He would see his eminent\n> father soon.\n>\n> As the *Dream Voyager* soared between stars, undisturbed, Seurat\n> suggested a friendly competition. The two sat at a table and engaged\n> in one of their customary diversions, an amusing private game they had\n> developed through frequent practice. The strategy involved an\n> imaginary space battle between two alien races--- the \"Vorians\" and\n> the \"Seurats\"--- each of which had a space fleet with precise\n> capabilities and limitations. Though the robot captain had a perfect\n> machine memory, Vor still fared well, as he invariably came up with\n> creative tactics that surprised his opponent.\n>\n> Now, as they took turns placing warships in the various sectors of\n> their fanciful space battlefield, Seurat reeled off an endless\n> succession of human jokes and riddles he had found in his old\n> databases. Annoyed, Vor finally said, \"You're making an overt attempt\n> to distract me. Where did you learn to do that?\"\n>\n> \"Why, from you, of course.\" The robot proceeded to mention the many\n> times in which Vor had teased him, threatening to sabotage the ship\n> without ever really intending to do so, concocting extraordinarily\n> unpredictable emergencies. \"Do you consider it cheating? On your part,\n> or on mine?\"\n>\n> This revelation astonished Vor. \"It saddens me to think that, even in\n> jest, I have taught you deception. It makes me ashamed to be human.\"\n> No doubt, Agamemnon would be disappointed in him.\n>\n> After two more rounds, Vor lost the tactical game. His heart was no\n> longer in it.\n>\n> *Every endeavor is a game, is it not?*\n\n--- IBLIS GINJO,\n\n*Options for Total Liberation*\n\n> **O**n a garden terrace overlooking the scarred ruins of Zimia, Xavier\n> Harkonnen stood somberly by himself, dreading the upcoming \"victory\"\n> parade. Afternoon sunlight warmed his face. Birdsong had replaced the\n> screams and explosions; breezes had scoured away the worst of the\n> poisonous smoke.\n>\n> Still, the League would be a long time recovering. Nothing would ever\n> be the same.\n>\n> Even days after the attack, he still saw smears of smoke wafting from\n> the rubble and trailing into a cloudless sky. He could not smell the\n> soot, though. The cymeks' poison gas had so damaged his tissues that\n> he would never smell or taste much of anything again. Even breathing\n> had become no more that a mechanical act, not an enjoyable inhalation\n> of sweet fresh air.\n>\n> But he could not wallow in misery when so many others had lost much\n> more. In the aftermath of the cymek attack, he had been kept alive by\n> the heroic efforts of a Salusan medical team. Serena Butler had come\n> to him at the hospital, but he remembered her only through a fog of\n> pain, drugs, and life-support systems. In an extraordinary procedure,\n> Xavier had received a double lung transplant, healthy organs provided\n> by the mysterious Tlulaxa. He knew Serena had worked vigorously with\n> the brilliant battlefield surgeons and a Tlulaxa flesh merchant named\n> Tuk Keedair to get him the treatment he needed.\n>\n> Now he could breathe again, despite intermittent bursts of pain.\n> Xavier would live to fight the machines another time. Thanks to\n> pharmaceuticals and advanced healing techniques, he had been able to\n> leave the hospital soon after the medical procedure.\n>\n> At the time of the attack, the flesh merchant Keedair had been in\n> Zimia on a routine sales call and barely escaped with his life. On the\n> Unallied Planet of Tlulax in the distant Thalim solar system, his\n> people ran organ farms, growing human hearts, lungs, kidneys, and\n> other body parts from viable cells. After the cymeks were driven away,\n> the secretive Tlulaxa had offered his biological wares to the\n> battlefield surgeons at Zimia's main field hospital. His ship's\n> cryogenic lockers were filled with sample body parts. A stroke of\n> luck, Keedair had admitted with a smile, that he could be there to\n> help the grievously injured Salusan citizens during their time of\n> great need.\n>\n> Following the successful surgery, Keedair had come to see Xavier in\n> the medical center. The Tlulaxa was a man of middle height but slight\n> of build, with dark eyes and an angular face. A long, dark braid hung\n> at the left side of his head, plaited tightly.\n>\n> Breathing in, carefully modulating his raspy voice, Xavier said, \"It\n> was fortunate you were here with new organs already stored aboard your\n> ship.\"\n>\n> Keedair rubbed his long-fingered hands together. \"If I had known the\n> cymeks would strike so ferociously, I would have brought a larger\n> supply of material from our organ farms. Your Salusan survivors could\n> use many more replacement parts, but additional ships cannot arrive\n> from the Thalim system for months.\"\n>\n> Before the flesh merchant left Xavier's room, he turned back and said,\n> \"Consider yourself one of the lucky ones, Tercero Harkonnen.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> IN BATTLE-SCARRED ZIMIA, grief-stricken survivors searched for their\n> dead, and buried them. As rubble was cleared, the death toll mounted.\n> Bodies were recovered, names of the missing were compiled. In spite of\n> such pain and sorrow, because of the attack free humanity grew\n> stronger.\n>\n> Viceroy Manion Butler had insisted that the people show only\n> determination in the aftermath. On the streets below Xavier's terrace,\n> final preparations were under way for a celebration of thanksgiving.\n> Banners\n>\n> with the open-hand sigil of human freedom fluttered in the wind.\n> Rough-looking men in dirty coats struggled to control magnificent\n> white Salusan stallions that had become agitated by the commotion. The\n> horses' manes were braided with tassles and bells, and their tails\n> swept behind them like waterfalls of fine hair. Festooned with ribbons\n> and flowers, the animals pranced, eager to march down the broad\n> central boulevard that had been washed clean of debris, soot, and\n> bloodstains.\n>\n> Xavier glanced uncertainly at the sky. How could he ever look at the\n> clouds again without dreading that he might see more pyramidal\n> dropcarriages plunging through the scrambler shields? Missiles were\n> already being installed, increased batteries to protect against an\n> attack from space. More patrols would be launched, circling the system\n> on the highest state of alert.\n>\n> Instead of attending a parade, he should be preparing the Salusan\n> Militia for another attack, increasing the number of picket ships and\n> scouts at the edge of the system, working out a more efficient rescue\n> and response plan. It was only a matter of time before the thinking\n> machines returned.\n>\n> The next meeting of the League Parliament would devote itself to\n> emergency measures and reparations. The representatives would sketch\n> out a reconstruction plan for Zimia. The cymek warrior-forms left\n> behind must be dismantled and analyzed for weaknesses.\n>\n> Xavier hoped the League would immediately dispatch a summons to\n> Poritrin, calling the brilliant Tio Holtzman to inspect his recently\n> installed scrambler shields. Only the great inventor himself could\n> devise a stopgap measure against the technical flaw the cymeks had\n> discovered.\n>\n> When Xavier mentioned his concerns to Viceroy Butler, the florid-faced\n> leader had nodded, but stopped further discussion. \"First, we must\n> have a day of affirmation, to celebrate the fact that we are alive.\"\n> Xavier saw deep sadness behind the Viceroy's mask of confidence. \"We\n> are not machines, Xavier. There must be more to our lives than war and\n> revenge.\"\n>\n> Hearing footsteps on the terrace, Xavier turned to see Serena Butler\n> smiling at him, her eyes flashing with a secret depth that she shared\n> with him now\n>\n> that no one could see the two of them. \"There is my heroic tercero.\"\n>\n> \"A man responsible for letting half a city be destroyed isn't usually\n> called a hero, Serena.\"\n>\n> \"No, but the term does apply to a man who saved the rest of the\n> planet. As you are fully aware, if you hadn't made your hard choice,\n> all of Zimia, all of Salusa, would have been crushed.\" She put a hand\n> on his shoulder and stood very close to him. \"I won't have you\n> wallowing in guilt during the victory parade. One day won't make much\n> difference.\"\n>\n> \"One day could very well make a *huge* difference,\" Xavier insisted.\n> \"We barely drove off the attackers this time because we were too\n> confident in the new scrambler shields, and because we foolishly\n> thought Omnius had decided to leave us alone after so many decades.\n> This would be the perfect time for them to hit us again. What if\n> they've launched a second wave?\"\n>\n> \"Omnius is still licking his wounds. I doubt his force has even\n> returned to the Synchronized Worlds yet.\"\n>\n> \"Machines don't lick wounds,\" he said.\n>\n> \"You're such a serious young man,\" she said. \"Please, just for the\n> parade? Our people need to have their spirits uplifted.\"\n>\n> \"Your father already gave me the same lecture.\"\n>\n> \"You know, of course, that if two Butlers say a thing, it's bound to\n> be true.\"\n>\n> He gave Serena a firm hug, then followed her from the terrace toward\n> the parade reviewing stand, where he would sit in a place of honor\n> beside the Viceroy.\n>\n> Since they'd been children, Xavier had always found himself attracted\n> to Serena; as they matured, they had grown confident of their\n> deepening feelings toward each other. Both he and Serena considered it\n> a foregone\n>\n> conclusion that they would wed, a rare perfect match of politics,\n> acceptable bloodlines, and romance.\n>\n> Now, though, with the sudden increase in hostilities, he reminded\n> himself of his greater priorities. Thanks to the disaster that had\n> killed Primero Meach, Xavier Harkonnen was interim commander of the\n> Salusan Militia, which forced him to face larger issues. He wanted to\n> do so much, but he was only one man.\n>\n> An hour later, the assemblage sat on a grandstand in the central\n> plaza. Scaffolding and temporary girders shored up the broken facades\n> of government buildings. The ornamental fountains no longer\n> functioned, but the citizens of Zimia knew there could be no other\n> place for such a presentation.\n>\n> Even burned and damaged, the tall edifices looked magnificent:\n> constructed in Salusan Gothic style with multilevel roof lines,\n> spires, and carved columns. Salusa Secundus was the seat of the League\n> government, but it also hosted the leading cultural and\n> anthropological museums. In surrounding neighborhoods, the crowded\n> dwellings were of simpler construction but pleasing to the eye,\n> whitewashed with lime taken from chalk cliffs. Salusans prided\n> themselves on having the best craftsmen and artisans in the League.\n> They did most of their production by hand instead of with automated\n> machinery.\n>\n> Along the parade route, the citizens dressed in colorful raiment of\n> magenta, blue, and yellow. People chattered and pointed as the\n> remarkable stallions passed them, followed by marching musicians and\n> folk dancers on hover-floats. One monstrous Salusan bull, drugged into\n> a near stupor to control it, plodded down the street.\n>\n> Though Xavier made the best of it all, he found himself constantly\n> glancing at the sky, and at the scars of the wounded city. . . .\n>\n> At the conclusion of the parade, Manion Butler delivered a speech\n> celebrating the successful defense but acknowledging the high cost of\n> the battle, tens of thousands killed or wounded. \"We have much healing\n> and\n>\n> recovery to do, but we also have an unbroken spirit, no matter what\n> the thinking machines may attempt.\"\n>\n> Addressing the crowd, the Viceroy summoned Xavier to the central\n> platform. \"I present for you our greatest hero, a man who stood firm\n> against the cymeks and made the *necessary* decisions to save us all.\n> Few others would have been strong enough to do the same.\"\n>\n> Feeling out of place, Xavier stepped forward to receive a military\n> medal on a striped blue, red, and gold ribbon from the Viceroy. In the\n> midst of cheers, Serena kissed him on the cheek. He hoped no one in\n> the crowd could see him blush.\n>\n> \"With this commendation comes a promotion to the rank of Tercero,\n> First Grade. Xavier Harkonnen, I charge you with studying defensive\n> tactics and installations for the entire League Armada. Your duties\n> will encompass the local Salusan Militia, along with responsibility\n> for improving the military security of the entire League of Nobles.\"\n>\n> The young officer felt awkward from the attention, but he graciously\n> accepted the accolades. \"I look forward to beginning the hard work of\n> our survival . . . and advancement.\" He favored Serena with an\n> indulgent smile. \"Following today's festivities, of course.\"\n>\n> *Dune is the planet-child of the worm.*\n\n--- from \"The Legend of Selim Wormrider,\" Zensunni Fire Poetry\n\n> **F**or an entire day and deep into the night, the monstrous sandworm\n> raced across the desert, forced beyond its normal territorial range.\n>\n> As the two moons rose and shone their curious light down upon Selim,\n> he clung to his metal staff, completely exhausted. Though he had\n> escaped being devoured by the wild and confused creature, he might\n> soon perish from the interminable ride. Buddallah had saved him, but\n> now seemed only to be toying with him.\n>\n> While thrusting the corroded spear, the youth had wedged himself into\n> a gap between worm segments, hoping he wouldn't be buried alive if the\n> demon plunged beneath the dunes. He huddled against rank flesh that\n> smelled of rotten meat impregnated with pungent cinnamon. He didn't\n> know what to do, but prayed and contemplated, searching for an\n> explanation.\n>\n> *Perhaps it is a test of some kind.*\n>\n> The sandworm continued to flee across the desert, its undersized brain\n> seemingly resigned to never again finding peace or safety. The beast\n> wanted to wallow into the dunes and hide from this malicious imp, but\n> Selim pried the spear as if it were a lever, irritating the wound\n> anew.\n>\n> The worm could only surge onward. Hour after hour.\n>\n> Selim's throat was parched, his eyes caked with grit. He must have\n> crossed half the desert already, and recognized no landforms on the\n> monotonous open bled. He had never been so far from the cave\n> community--- no one had, as far as he knew. Even if he somehow escaped\n> this giant monster, he would be doomed in the unforgiving Arrakis\n> wasteland because of his unjust sentence.\n>\n> He was certain his faithless friend Ebrahim would be exposed one day,\n> and the truth would come out; the traitor would violate other tribal\n> rules, and would eventually be recognized for the thief and liar that\n> he was. If Selim ever saw him again, he would challenge Ebrahim to a\n> fight to the death, and honor would win out.\n>\n> Perhaps the tribe would applaud him, since no one in even the grandest\n> fire poems had ever braved a giant sandworm and lived. Maybe the\n> saucy, dark-eyed young Zensunni women would look at Selim with bright\n> smiles. Dust-covered but with his head held high, he would stand\n> before stern Naib Dhartha and demand readmittance to the community. To\n> have ridden a desert demon and *lived!*\n>\n> But, though Selim had already managed to survive longer than he had\n> ever hoped, the outcome was by no means assured. What was he to do\n> now?\n>\n> Beneath him, the worm made peculiar, agitated noises, an invertebrate\n> sound beyond the loud whisper of hot sand. The weary beast shuddered,\n> and a tremor ran down its sinuous body. Selim could smell flint and an\n> overpowering aroma of spice. Friction-induced furnaces burned inside\n> the worm's gullet, like the depths of Sheol itself.\n>\n> As lemony dawn tinged the sky, the worm became more unruly and\n> desperate. It thrashed about, trying to dig itself into the sand, but\n> Selim wouldn't permit that. The monster slammed its blunt head into a\n> dune, smashing a dust spray into the air. The youth had to throw all\n> of his body weight against the spear, digging into the raw, exposed\n> worm segment.\n>\n> \"You are as sore and exhausted as I am, aren't you, Shaitan?\" he said\n> in a voice as thin and dry as paper. *Almost exhausted unto death*.\n>\n> Selim didn't dare let go. The moment he dropped off onto the barren\n> dunes, the sandworm would turn about and devour him. He had no choice\n> but to keep driving the creature. The ordeal seemed endless.\n>\n> As daylight grew brighter, he noticed a faint haze on the far horizon,\n> a distant storm with winds bearing flakes of sand and dust. But the\n>\n> disturbance was far away, and Selim had other concerns.\n>\n> At last, the demon worm ground itself to a halt not far from a ridge\n> of rocks, and refused to move. With a final convulsion, it slumped its\n> serpentine head onto a dune crest and lay like a slain dragon,\n> quivering . . . then went utterly still.\n>\n> Selim trembled with absolute weariness, fearing this was some kind of\n> final trick. The monster might be waiting for him to drop his guard so\n> it could swallow him up. Could a sandworm be devious? Was it truly\n> Shaitan?*Or did I ride it to death?*\n>\n> Gathering his energy, Selim straightened. His cramped muscles\n> trembled. He could barely move. Joints were numb; nerves prickled as\n> they awakened with the creeping fire of restored circulation. At last,\n> risking all, he yanked the metal spear from the pink flesh between the\n> callused segments.\n>\n> The worm didn't even twitch.\n>\n> Selim slid down the rounded bulk and hit the sand running. His boots\n> pumped up little dust clouds as he raced across the undulating\n> landscape. The far-off rocks were black mounds of safety protruding\n> from golden dunes.\n>\n> He refused to look behind him and ran on, gasping. Each breath was\n> like dry fire in his throat. His ears tingled, anticipating the hiss\n> of sand, the rippling approach of the vengeful creature. But the\n> sandworm remained still.\n>\n> Filled with desperate energy, Selim sprinted for half a kilometer.\n> Reaching the rock barricade, he scrambled up and finally allowed\n> himself to collapse. Drawing his knees against his chest, he sat\n> gazing out into the wash of daylight, watching the worm.\n>\n> It never moved. *Is Shaitan playing a trick? Is Buddallah testing me?*\n>\n> By now Selim was very, very hungry. He shouted at the sky, \"If you\n> have saved me for some purpose, then why not offer a bit of food?\" In\n> the extremity of his exhaustion, he began to chuckle.\n>\n> *One does not make demands of God*.\n>\n> Then he realized that there was food, of a sort. In his flight to the\n> rock sanctuary, Selim had crossed a thick ochre patch of spice, veins\n> of melange like those the Zensunni sometimes found when they ventured\n> onto the sands. They gathered the substance, using it as a food\n> additive and stimulant. Naib Dhartha kept a small stockpile within the\n> cave warrens, occasionally brewing from it a potent spice beer, which\n> the tribe members consumed on special occasions and traded at the\n> Arrakis City spaceport.\n>\n> He sat in the uncertain shade for nearly an hour, looking for any sign\n> of movement from the monster. Nothing. The day became hotter, and the\n> desert lapsed into a sluggish silence. The distant storm seemed to\n> move no closer. Selim felt as if the world itself was holding its\n> breath.\n>\n> Then, growing brash again--- after all, he had ridden Shaitan!---\n> Selim crawled down from the rocks and scurried out to the patch of\n> melange. There, he raised a wary gaze in the direction of the ominous\n> hulk.\n>\n> Standing in the rust-hued sand, he scrabbled with his hands, scooping\n> up the dry red powder. He gobbled it, spat out a few grains of sand,\n> and immediately felt the stimulant of raw spice, a large quantity to\n> take all at once. It made him dizzy, gave him an explosion of energy.\n>\n> Finally sated, he stood at a distance from the flaccid worm, hands on\n> his hips, glaring. Then he waved his arms, shouting into the utter\n> silence, \"I defeated you, Shaitan! You meant to eat me, old crawler,\n> but I conquered you instead!\" He waved his hands again. \"Can you hear\n> me?\"\n>\n> But he detected not even a flicker. Euphoric from the melange and\n> foolishly brave, he marched back toward the long sinuous body that lay\n> on the dune crest. Only a few footsteps away, he stared up into the\n> face. Its cavernous\n>\n> mouth was studded with glittering internal thorns. The long fangs\n> looked like the tiniest of hairs in relation to the creature's immense\n> size.\n>\n> Now the dust storm approached, accompanied by skirling hot breezes.\n> The wind seized grains of sand and fragments of rock, whipping them\n> against his face like tiny darts. Gusts stole around the curved\n> carcass of the worm with a whispery, hooting sound. It seemed as if\n> the ghost of the beast was *daring him*, prodding him forward. The\n> spice thrummed in Selim's bloodstream.\n>\n> Boldly, he strode to the worm's maw and peered into the black infinity\n> of its mouth. The hellish friction-fires inside were cold; not even an\n> ember remained.\n>\n> He shouted again, \"I killed you, old crawler. I am Worm Slayer.\" The\n> sandworm did not respond even to this provocation.\n>\n> He looked up at the daggerlike fangs, curved shards that lined the\n> wide, smelly mouth. Buddallah seemed to be urging him on, or maybe it\n> was simply his own desire. Moving before common sense could catch up\n> with him, Selim climbed over the lower lip of the worm and reached the\n> nearest sharp tooth.\n>\n> The young outcast grabbed it with both hands, feeling how hard it was,\n> a material even stronger than metal. He twisted and wrenched. The\n> worm's body was soft, as if the tissues of its throat were losing\n> integrity. With a suppressed grunt, Selim uprooted the fang. It was as\n> long as his forearm, curved and pure and glistening with milky\n> whiteness.

Having already lived more\n> than a thousand years, the cymek general had learned to be patient.\n>\n> As patient as a machine.\n>\n> Following their secret rendezvous near the red dwarf star, he and his\n> fellow Titans reached Corrin after an interstellar voyage of nearly\n> two months. The robotic fleet had arrived days before, delivering the\n> battle images captured by the watcheyes. The evermind already knew\n> about the defeat. All that remained was for Omnius to issue rebukes\n> and reprimands, especially to Agamemnon, who had been in command.\n>\n> As he landed his ship under the blazing giant sun of Corrin, the cymek\n> general reached out with his sensor network, accepting data through\n> his thoughtrodes. Omnius would be waiting, as always, after a mission.\n>\n> Perhaps by now the evermind would have accepted the failure.\n>\n> A false hope, Agamemnon knew. The all-pervasive computer did not react\n> in the manner of a human.\n>\n> Before emerging from his ship, the Titan general chose an efficient\n> mobile body, little more than a streamlined cart that carried his\n> brain canister and life-support systems connected to the framework.\n> The cymek moved out\n>\n> onto the paved boulevards under the enormous baleful eye of the red\n> giant.\n>\n> Harsh crimson light washed the flagstoned streets and white facades.\n>\n> Millennia ago, the bloated star had expanded, growing so large that\n> its outer layers swallowed the inner planets of the system. Corrin\n> itself had once been a frozen outlying world, but the increased heat\n> from the swollen giant now made the planet habitable.\n>\n> After the atmosphere thawed and the icy seas boiled away, Corrin's\n> landscape became a blank slate on which the Old Empire established a\n> colony during its younger, ambitious days. Most of the ecosystem had\n> been transplanted from elsewhere, but even after thousands of years\n> Corrin still seemed an *unfinished* world, missing many of the\n> ecological details necessary for a thriving planet. Omnius and his\n> independent robot Erasmus liked the place because it seemed new and\n> unburdened by the baggage of history.\n>\n> Agamemnon trundled along the streets, followed by hovering watcheyes\n> that monitored him like electronic guard dogs. With surveillance\n> monitors and speakers throughout the city, the evermind could have\n> conferred with him anywhere on Corrin. Omnius, however, insisted on\n> receiving the cymek general in a lavish central pavilion built by\n> human slave labor. This pilgrimage of contrition was part of\n> Agamemnon's penance for the Salusa failure. The powerful computer\n> understood the concept of dominance.\n>\n> The electrafluid surrounding his brain churned blue as Agamemnon\n> prepared to defend himself against a rigorous interrogation. His\n> mobile body passed under tall arches supported by scrolled white-metal\n> columns. Eccentric and earnest, the robot Erasmus had copied\n> ostentatious trappings from historical records of human empires. The\n> awesome gateway was designed to make visitors tremble, though the\n> Titan doubted Omnius cared about such things.\n>\n> The cymek general halted at the center of a courtyard where fountains\n> trickled from gaps in the walls. Tame sparrows flitted about the eaves\n> and\n>\n> nested atop the pillars. Inside terra cotta urns, scarlet lilies\n> bloomed in violent explosions of petals.\n>\n> \"I have arrived, Lord Omnius,\" Agamemnon announced through his voice\n> synthesizer--- a mere formality, because he had been closely observed\n> since emerging from his ship. He waited.\n>\n> In the echoing pavilion, the mirror-faced Erasmus was nowhere to be\n> seen. Omnius wanted to upbraid his general without the curious\n> scrutiny of the independent and annoying robot. Though Erasmus fancied\n> that he understood human emotions, Agamemnon doubted the eccentric\n> machine would show even a glimmer of compassion.\n>\n> The voice boomed from a dozen speakers in the walls, like an angry\n> deity. No doubt the effect was intentional. \"You and your cymeks have\n> failed, General.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon already knew how the discussion would play out--- as did\n> Omnius. Surely the evermind himself had run simulations. Yet, this was\n> a dance that must be continued.\n>\n> \"We fought hard, but could not achieve victory, Lord Omnius. The\n> *hrethgir* put up an unexpectedly fierce defense and were surprisingly\n> willing to sacrifice their city rather than let the shield generators\n> fall. As I have said many times, feral humans are dangerously\n> unpredictable.\"\n>\n> Omnius responded without hesitation. \"You have repeatedly insisted\n> that cymeks are far superior to the human vermin, combining the best\n> advantages of machine and man. How, then, could you be rebuffed by\n> such untrained, uncivilized creatures?\"\n>\n> \"In this instance, I was in error. The humans realized our true\n> objective faster than we had anticipated.\"\n>\n> \"Your forces did not fight hard enough,\" Omnius said.\n>\n> \"Six neo-cymeks were destroyed. The gladiator body of the Titan Xerxes\n> was demolished, and he barely escaped in a launch pod.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, but the remainder of your cymeks survived. A mere twenty-one\n> percent loss does not equate with 'fighting to your fullest.'\" Around\n> the courtyard, chirping sparrows flitted about, oblivious to the\n> tension between Omnius and his top military officer. \"You should have\n> been willing to sacrifice all your cymeks to bring down the scrambler\n> shields.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon was glad he no longer displayed human expressions, which the\n> computer mind might be able to interpret. \"Lord Omnius, cymeks are\n> irreplaceable *individuals*, unlike your robotic thinking machines. In\n> my estimation, risking the loss of your most vital Titans was not a\n> reasonable exchange for one insignificant planet infested with feral\n> humans.\"\n>\n> \"Insignificant? Before the mission you emphasized the extreme\n> importance of Salusa Secundus to the League of Nobles. You claimed\n> that its fall would precipitate a complete collapse of free humanity.\n> *You* were in command.\"\n>\n> \"But is the League itself worth the obliteration of your remaining\n> Titans? We created you, established the foundation for your\n> Synchronized Worlds. The Titans should be used for more than cannon\n> fodder.\" Agamemnon was curious as to how the evermind would respond to\n> this line of reasoning. Perhaps by setting up the Titans to fall in\n> battle against feral humans, Omnius planned to bypass the choke-hold\n> of Barbarossa's protective programming.\n>\n> \"Let me ponder that,\" Omnius said. Screens on the pavilion walls\n> projected watcheye images from the battle on Zimia. \"The *hrethgir*\n> are smarter than you presumed. They saw your target. You made an error\n> in judgment thinking your cymeks would be able to push forward\n> easily.\"\n>\n> \"I miscalculated,\" Agamemnon admitted. \"The humans have a clever\n> military commander. His unexpected decisions allowed them to mount a\n> successful resistance. Now, at least, we have tested their scrambler\n> fields.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon's explanations rapidly degenerated into a succession of\n> rationalizations and excuses. Omnius analyzed and dismissed them,\n> leaving the Titan feeling bare and humiliated.\n>\n> In the serene courtyard, bright flowers bloomed and birds sang.\n> Trickling fountains added their musical sounds . . . and Agamemnon\n> contained his outrage within himself. Even his sensitive mechanical\n> body showed no sign of agitation. A thousand years ago, he and his\n> fellow Titans had controlled these damnable thinking machines. *We\n> created you, Omnius. One day, we will also destroy you.*\n>\n> While it had taken the visionary Tlaloc and his group of rebels only a\n> few years to conquer the sleepy Old Empire, Omnius and his thinking\n> machines proved to be a far superior adversary, never sleeping, always\n> watching. But even machines made mistakes. Agamemnon just needed to\n> exploit them.\n>\n> \"Is there anything else, Lord Omnius?\" he interrupted. Further\n> arguments and excuses would serve no purpose. Above all else, machines\n> craved efficiency.\n>\n> \"Only my next set of instructions, Agamemnon.\" The Omnius voice moved\n> from speaker to speaker, giving the impression that he was everywhere\n> at once. \"I am dispatching you and your Titans back to Earth. You will\n> accompany Erasmus, who intends to continue his studies of captive\n> humans there.\"\n>\n> \"As you command, Lord Omnius.\" Though surprised, Agamemnon showed no\n> reaction. *Earth* . . . a very long journey. \"We will determine other\n> ways to destroy this blight of humanity. The Titans exist only to\n> serve you.\"\n>\n> It was one of the few advantages of Agamemnon's human side: Even\n> though the evermind was filled with a vast quantity of data, Omnius\n> did not know how to recognize a simple lie.\n>\n> *From a certain perspective, defense and offense encompass nearly\n> identical tactics.*\n\n--- XAVIER HARKONNEN,\n\nraddress to Salusan Militia\n\n> **N**ew duties, new responsibilities . . . and more good-byes. As a\n> mostly recovered Xavier Harkonnen stood with Serena Butler inside the\n> Zimia Spaceport, the departure facility seemed a sterile environment\n> with echoing plaztile floors. Even the warmth of Serena's expression\n> did not compensate for the utilitarian structure. Window walls looked\n> out onto the fused pavement where shuttles took off and landed every\n> few minutes, going to and from the larger long-distance ships that\n> waited in orbit.\n>\n> In one wing of the spaceport, work crews shored up sections of a\n> hangar damaged during the cymek attack. Large cranes lifted temporary\n> walls and braces into place. Out on the landing field, huge blast\n> craters had been filled in.\n>\n> Dressed in a crisp gold-and-black Armada uniform reflecting his new\n> grade, Xavier gazed deeply into Serena's unusual lavender eyes. He\n> knew how she saw him. His facial features were not particularly\n> striking--- ruddy complexion, pointed nose, generous lips--- but\n> overall she found him attractive, especially the soft brown eyes and\n> his infectious, though rarely used, smile.\n>\n> \"I wish we could spend more time together, Xavier.\" She fingered a\n> white rose floweret on her lapel. The spaceport drone of other people,\n> noisy repair crews and heavy machinery surrounded them.\n>\n> Xavier noticed Serena's younger sister Octa watching them. A\n> seventeen-year-old with long strawberry-blond hair, she'd always had a\n> crush on Xavier. Willowy Octa was a nice enough girl, but recently he\n> wished she would give him and Serena a little more privacy, especially\n> now that they would be apart for so long.\n>\n> \"So do I. Let's make these minutes count.\" Surrendering to the urge he\n> knew they both shared, he leaned forward to kiss her, as if his lips\n> were drawn by a magnetic force. The kiss lingered, then grew intense.\n> At last Xavier pulled back. Serena looked disappointed, more with the\n> situation than with him. They both had important duties, demands on\n> their time and energy.\n>\n> Newly installed in his position, Xavier was about to embark with a\n> group of military specialists on an inspection tour of League\n> planetary defenses. After the nearly successful cymek strike against\n> Salusa two months ago, he would make certain there were no weaknesses\n> on other League Worlds. The thinking machines would exploit the\n> tiniest flaw, and free humans could not afford to lose any of their\n> remaining strongholds.\n>\n> Serena Butler, meanwhile, would focus on expanding the League domain.\n> After the battlefield surgeons had been so successful with the fresh\n> tank-grown organs provided by Tuk Keedair, Serena had spoken\n> passionately about the services and resources the Unallied Planets\n> such as Tlulaxa could provide. She wanted them to formally join the\n> union of free humans.\n>\n> Already, more flesh merchants had arrived on Salusa with their\n> biological wares; previously, many nobles and League citizens had been\n> uneasy about the mysterious outsiders, but now that the war-wounded\n> faced terrible losses of limbs and organs, they were willing to accept\n> cloned replacement parts. The Tlulaxa never explained where they had\n> developed or obtained such sophisticated biological technology, but\n> Serena praised their generosity and resources.\n>\n> At any other time, her speech in the Hall of Parliament might have\n> been forgotten, but the cymek attack had underscored her point about\n> the vulnerability of the Unallied Planets. What if the machines next\n> chose to wipe out the Thalim system and thereby eliminate the Tlulaxan\n> ability to give sight to blind veterans, new limbs to amputees?\n>\n> She had studied hundreds of survey documents and ambassadorial\n> reports, trying to determine which of the nonsignatory planets were\n> the best\n>\n> candidates for induction into the League brotherhood. Unifying the\n> remnants of humanity had become her passion, to make the free people\n> strong enough to put down any machine aggression.\n>\n> Despite her youth, she had already led two successful aid missions,\n> the first when she was only seventeen. In one she had taken food and\n> medical supplies to refugees from an abandoned Synchronized World, and\n> in the other she had provided relief for a biological blight that\n> almost destroyed the pristine farms on Poritrin.\n>\n> Neither she nor Xavier had time for themselves.\n>\n> \"When you return, I promise I will make it up to you,\" she said, her\n> eyes dancing. \"I'll give you a banquet of kisses.\"\n>\n> He allowed himself a rare laugh. \"Then I plan to arrive very hungry\n> indeed!\" Xavier took her hand and kissed it gallantly. \"When we dine\n> again, I shall come calling with flowers.\" He knew their next\n> rendezvous could be months away.\n>\n> She gave him a warm smile. \"I have a particular fondness for flowers.\"\n>\n> He was about to pull Serena close, but they were interrupted by a\n> familiar brown-skinned child coming from another direction--- Xavier's\n> eight-year-old brother, Vergyl Tantor. The boy had been permitted to\n> leave school to see him off. Breaking free of an elderly instructor\n> escort, Vergyl ran to hug his idol, nuzzling his face into the crisp\n> uniform shirt.\n>\n> \"Take care of our estate while I am gone, little brother,\" Xavier\n> said, playfully rubbing his knuckles on the boy's wiry hair. \"You are\n> in charge of tending my wolfhounds--- you understand?\"\n>\n> The boy's brown eyes widened, and he nodded gravely. \"Yes.\"\n>\n> \"And obey your parents, otherwise you can't hope to grow up to become\n> a good officer in the Armada.\"\n>\n> \"I will!\"\n>\n> An announcement summoned the inspection team to board the shuttle.\n> Hearing it, Xavier promised to bring something back for Vergyl, Octa,\n> and Serena. While Octa watched from a distance, smiling hopefully, he\n> hugged his little brother again, squeezed Serena's hand, and strode\n> off with the officers and engineers.\n>\n> Staring at the window wall where they could watch the waiting military\n> shuttle, Serena glanced down at the boy and thought of Xavier\n> Harkonnen. Xavier had been only six years old when thinking machines\n> had killed his natural parents and his older brother.\n>\n> Because of interfamily agreements and the written wills of Ulf and\n> Katarina Harkonnen, young Xavier had been raised as the foster son of\n> powerful and then-childless Emil and Lucille Tantor. The noble couple\n> had already made arrangements for their holdings to be administered by\n> Tantor relatives, distant cousins and nephews who would not normally\n> have inherited anything. But when Emil Tantor began to raise Xavier,\n> he was quite taken with the orphan and legally adopted him, though\n> Xavier retained his Harkonnen name and all associated noble rights.\n>\n> After the adoption, Lucille Tantor unexpectedly conceived a son,\n> Vergyl, who was twelve years younger than Xavier. The Harkonnen heir,\n> not worried about dynastic politics, concentrated on a course of\n> military studies, intending to join the League Armada. At the age of\n> eighteen Xavier received the legal entitlement to the original\n> Harkonnen holdings, and a year later he became an officer in the\n> Salusan Militia. With his impeccable performance and rapid promotions,\n> everyone could see Xavier was a rising star in the military ranks.\n>\n> Now three people who cared about him watched the shuttle lift into the\n> sky on a plume of orange exhaust. Vergyl held Serena's hand, bravely\n> trying to comfort her. \"Xavier will be all right. You can count on\n> him.\"\n>\n> She felt a pang for her departing love, but smiled warmly at the\n> wide-eyed boy. \"Of course we can.\"\n>\n> She would have it no other way. Love was one of the things that\n> separated humans from machines.\n>\n> *The answer is a mirror of the question.*\n\n--- COGITOR KWYNA,\n\nCity of Introspection archives\n\n> **T**he temporary meeting chamber for the League delegates had\n> originally been the home of the first Viceroy, Bovko Manresa. Before\n> the Titans had taken over the weak Old Empire, Manresa had built the\n> mansion on then-isolated Salusa Secundus as a way of celebrating\n> wealth garnered from his planetary land dealings. Later, when refugee\n> humans began arriving, driven out by the cruel rule of the Twenty\n> Titans, the big house had become a meeting hall, with chairs and a\n> lectern set up in the grand ballroom, as they were today.\n>\n> Months ago, within hours of the cymek attack, Viceroy Butler had stood\n> on a pile of rubble beneath the broken central dome of the Hall of\n> Parliament. While the poisonous dust settled in the streets and fires\n> still blazed in damaged buildings, he had vowed to repair the\n> venerable old facility that had served the League for centuries.\n>\n> The governmental edifice was more than just a building: It was\n> hallowed ground on which legendary leaders had debated great ideas and\n> formulated plans against the machines. The damage to the roof and\n> upper floors was severe, but the basic structure remained sound. Just\n> like the human spirit it represented.\n>\n> It was a frosty morning outside, with fog on the windows. Leaves on\n> the hills had begun to turn lovely autumn shades of yellow, orange,\n> and brown. Serena and the representatives came inside the temporary\n> meeting hall, still clinging to their coats.\n>\n> She gazed at the walls of the crowded old ballroom, at paintings of\n> long-dead leaders and depictions of past victories. She wondered what\n> the future would bring, and what her place might be in it. She wanted\n> so badly to *do* something, to help in the great crusade of humankind.\n>\n> Most of her life she had been an activist, always willing to get her\n> hands dirty, to assist in aiding the victims of other tragedies such\n> as natural disasters or machine attacks. Even during pleasant times,\n> she had joined the work crews of harvesters to pick grapes from the\n> Butler estate vineyards or olives from the gnarled groves.\n>\n> She took a seat in the first row, then watched as her soft-featured\n> father made his way across the wood parquet floor to the antique\n> lectern. Viceroy Butler was followed by a monk in a red-velvet tunic\n> carrying a large plexiplaz container that held a living human brain in\n> viscous electrafluid. The monk lovingly placed the container on an\n> ornate table beside the lectern, then stood beside it.\n>\n> From her front-row seat, Serena saw the pinkish gray tissue undulate\n> slightly within the pale-blue life-support liquid. Separated from the\n> senses and distractions of the physical world for more than a\n> millennium, stimulated by constant intense contemplation, the female\n> Cogitor's once-human brain had grown larger than its original size.\n>\n> \"The Cogitor Kwyna does not often leave the City of Introspection,\"\n> Viceroy Butler said, sounding both formal and excited. \"But in these\n> times we require the best thoughts and advice. If any mind can\n> understand the thinking machines, it will be Kwyna's.\"\n>\n> These esoteric disembodied philosophers were seen so infrequently that\n> many League representatives did not understand how they managed to\n> communicate. Compounding the mystery that surrounded them, Cogitors\n> rarely said much, choosing instead to marshall their energies and\n> contribute only the most important thoughts.\n>\n> \"The Cogitor's Secondary will speak for Kwyna,\" the Viceroy said, \"if\n> she has any insights to offer.\"\n>\n> Beside the brain canister, the red-robed monk removed the sealed lid,\n> exposing the agitated viscous fluid. Blinking his round eyes rapidly,\n> he stared into the tank. Slowly, the monk slid one naked hand into the\n> soup, immersing his fingers. He closed his eyes, drawing deep breaths,\n> as he\n>\n> tentatively touched the convoluted brain. His brows furrowed with\n> concentration and acceptance as the electrafluid soaked into his\n> pores, linking the Cogitor with the Secondary's neural system, using\n> him as an extension in much the same way cymeks used artificial\n> mechanical bodies.\n>\n> \"I understand nothing,\" said the monk in a strange, distant voice.\n> Serena knew that was the first principle the Cogitors adopted, and the\n> contemplative brains spent centuries in deep study, adding to that\n> sense of nothingness.\n>\n> Centuries before the original Titans, a group of spiritual humans had\n> enjoyed studying philosophy and discussing esoteric issues, but too\n> many frailties and temptations of the flesh inhibited their ability to\n> concentrate. In the ennui of the Old Empire, these metaphysical\n> scholars had been the first to have their brains installed in\n> life-support systems. Freed of biological constraints, they spent all\n> their time learning and thinking. Each Cogitor wanted to study the\n> entirety of human philosophy, bringing together the ingredients to\n> understand the universe. They lived in ivory towers and contemplated,\n> rarely bothering to note the superficial relationships and events of\n> the mundane world.\n>\n> Kwyna, the two-thousand-year-old Cogitor who resided in Salusa's City\n> of Introspection, claimed to be politically neutral. \"I am ready to\n> interact,\" she announced through the monk, who stared with glazed eyes\n> at the assembly. \"You may begin.\"\n>\n> With intense blue eyes, Viceroy Butler gazed around the packed\n> ballroom, pausing to look at a number of faces, including Serena's.\n> \"My friends, we have always lived under the threat of annihilation,\n> and now I must ask every one of you to devote your time, energies, and\n> money to our cause.\"\n>\n> He gave tribute to the tens of thousands of Salusans who had died in\n> the cymek onslaught, along with fifty-one visiting dignitaries. \"The\n> Salusan Militia remains on full alert here, and messenger ships have\n> been dispatched to all League Worlds, warning them of the danger. We\n> can only hope that no other planets were attacked.\"\n>\n> The Viceroy then called upon Tio Holtzman, recently arrived after\n> nearly a month in transit from his laboratories on Poritrin. \"Savant\n> Holtzman, we are anxious to hear your assessment of the new defenses.\"\n>\n> Holtzman had been eager to inspect his orbital scrambler fields, to\n> see how they might be modified and improved. On Poritrin, the\n> flamboyant nobleman Niko Bludd funded the Savant's research. Given his\n> past accomplishments, League members always held out the hope that\n> Holtzman would pull some other miracle out of his pocket.\n>\n> Slight of body, Holtzman moved with grace and an enormous stage\n> presence, wearing clean and stylish robes. The iron gray hair that\n> hung to his shoulders was square-cut, framing a narrow face. A man of\n> immense confidence and ego, he loved to speak to important dignitaries\n> in the Parliament, but now he appeared uncharacteristically troubled.\n> In truth, the inventor could not bring himself to admit a mistake.\n> Unquestionably, his scrambler network had failed. The cymeks had\n> broken through! What would he say to these people who had relied on\n> him?\n>\n> Reaching the speaking platform, the great man cleared his throat and\n> looked around, glancing oddly at the imposing presence of the Cogitor\n> and the looming attendant monk. This was a most delicate matter. How\n> could he shift the blame from himself?\n>\n> The scientist used his best voice. \"In warfare, whenever one side\n> makes a technological breakthrough, the other attempts to top it. We\n> recently witnessed this with my atmospheric scrambler fields. Had they\n> not been installed here, the full thinking machine fleet would have\n> laid waste to Salusa. Unfortunately, I did not factor in the unique\n> abilities of the cymeks. They found a chink in the armor and\n> penetrated it.\"\n>\n> No one had accused him of lax work or poor planning, but this was the\n> closest Holtzman would come to admitting that he had overlooked a\n> major flaw. \"Now it is our turn to surpass the machines with a new\n> concept. I hope to be inspired by this tragedy, pushing my creativity\n> to its limits.\" He then\n>\n> stalled and looked embarrassed, even endearing. \"I'll be working on\n> that, as soon as I get back to Poritrin. I hope to have a surprise for\n> you very soon.\"\n>\n> A tall, statuesque woman glided toward the lectern, drawing attention\n> to herself. \"Perhaps I have a suggestion.\" She had pale eyebrows,\n> white hair, and luminous skin that made her seem ethereal, but charged\n> with power.\n>\n> \"Let us hear from the women of Rossak. I gladly yield to Zufa Cenva.\"\n> Looking relieved, Holtzman hurried back to his seat and slumped into\n> it.\n>\n> The pale woman carried an air of mystery about her; she wore glowing\n> jewelry on a black, diaphanous gown that revealed much of her perfect\n> body. Pausing at the Cogitor's life-support case, Zufa Cenva peered\n> inside at the enlarged brain. Her brow furrowed as she concentrated,\n> and as she did so, the brain itself seemed to vibrate; the\n> electrafluid swirled, bubbles formed. Alarmed, the devout attendant\n> monk withdrew his hand from the liquid.\n>\n> The tall woman relaxed, satisfied, and stepped to the podium. \"Because\n> of oddities in our environment, many of the females born on Rossak\n> exhibit enhanced telepathic abilities.\" Indeed, the powerful\n> Sorceresses of the dense, barely habitable jungles had parlayed their\n> mental quirks into political influence. Rossak men exhibited no such\n> telepathic enhancements.\n>\n> \"The League of Nobles was formed a thousand years ago for our mutual\n> defense, first against the Titans and then against Omnius. Since then,\n> we have barricaded ourselves, trying to protect our worlds from the\n> enemy.\" Her eyes flashed like highly polished stones. \"We need to\n> rethink this strategy. Perhaps it is time for *us* to take the\n> offensive against the Synchronized Worlds. Otherwise, Omnius and his\n> minions will never leave us alone.\"\n>\n> The League representatives muttered at this, looking fearful,\n> especially after the devastation Zimia had just endured. The Viceroy\n> was first to respond. \"That is a bit premature, Madame Cenva. I'm not\n> sure we have the capability.\"\n>\n> \"We barely survived the last attack!\" a man shouted. \"And we had only\n> a handful of cymeks to contend with.\"\n>\n> Manion Butler looked deeply concerned. \"Confronting Omnius would be a\n> suicide mission. What weapons would we use?\"\n>\n> In response, the imposing woman squared her shoulders and spread her\n> hands, while closing her eyes and concentrating. Although Zufa was\n> known to have extrasensory powers, she had never before displayed them\n> in Parliament. Her milky pale skin seemed to heat up with an inner\n> light. The air in the enclosed chamber stirred, and static electricity\n> crackled around the assemblage, making hair stand on end.\n>\n> Lightning flickered at her fingertips, as if she were holding a barely\n> contained thunderstorm inside herself. Her own white hair coiled and\n> writhed like snakes. When Zufa's eyes opened again, a dazzling energy\n> seemed ready to shoot out of them, as if the universe lived behind her\n> pupils.\n>\n> Gasps echoed through the delegates. Serena's skin crawled and her\n> scalp tingled, as if a thousand poisonous spiders skittered over her\n> mind. In her preservation tank, the Cogitor Kwyna churned.\n>\n> Then Zufa relaxed, throttling back the chain reaction of mental\n> energy. Letting out a long, cold breath, the Sorceress smiled grimly\n> at the startled onlookers. \"*We* have a weapon.\"\n>\n> *The eyes of common perception do not see far. Too often we make the\n> most important decisions based only on superficial information.*\n>\n> --- NORMA CENVA,\n\nunpublished laboratory notebooks\n\n> **A**fter delivering her announcement to the League assembly, Zufa\n> Cenva returned to Rossak. She had been in transit for weeks, and her\n> shuttle now landed on a dense section of the jungle canopy that had\n> been paved over with a polymer to seal and fuse the branches and\n> leaves into a solid mass. To enable the trees to receive adequate\n> moisture and gas exchange, the polymer was porous, synthesized from\n> jungle chemicals and organics.\n>\n> Toxic oceans made the native Rossak planktons, fish, kelp, and sea\n> creatures poisonous to humans. Rugged, sterile lava plains covered\n> much of the planet's land area, dotted with geysers and brimstone\n> lakes. Since the botanical chemistry did not rely on chlorophyll, the\n> general cast of all plants was silvery purple; nothing here was fresh\n> and green.\n>\n> In a tectonically stable zone girdling the equator, large rifts in the\n> continental plate created broad sanctuary valleys where the water was\n> filtered and the air breathable. In these protected rift ecosystems,\n> hardy human settlers had constructed sophisticated cave-cities like\n> hives tunneled into the black cliffs. The declivitous external walls\n> were overgrown with silvery-purple vines, drooping ferns, and fleshy\n> moss. Comfortable chambers looked out upon a thick jungle canopy that\n> pressed against the settlement cliffs. People could venture directly\n> onto the upper rubbery branches and descend to the dense underbrush,\n> where they harvested edibles.\n>\n> As if to make up for the dearth of life elsewhere on Rossak, the rift\n> valleys teemed with aggressive living things--- mushrooms, lichens,\n> berries, flowers, orchidlike parasites, and insects. The Rossak men,\n> lacking the telepathic enhancement of their women, had turned their\n> talents to developing and extracting drugs, pharmaceuticals, and\n> occasional poisons\n>\n> from nature's larder. The entire place was like a Pandora's box that\n> had been opened only a crack. . . .\n>\n> Now the tall, luminous Sorceress watched as her much younger paramour,\n> Aurelius Venport, crossed a suspended bridge from the open cliffs to\n> the foamy purple treetops. His patrician features were handsome, his\n> dark hair curly, his face long and lean. Tagging along behind him on\n> stubby legs came Zufa's disappointing fifteen-year-old daughter by a\n> prior relationship.\n>\n> *Two misfits. No wonder they get along so well*.\n>\n> Prior to seducing Aurelius Venport, the chief Sorceress had arranged\n> conjugal relationships with four other men during her peak breeding\n> times, selecting them for their proven bloodlines. After generations\n> of research, miserable miscarriages, and defective offspring, the\n> women of Rossak had compiled detailed genetic indices of various\n> families. Because of heavy environmental toxins and teratogens, the\n> odds were against any child being born strong and healthy. But for\n> every stillborn monster or talentless male, a miraculous pale-skinned\n> Sorceress might occur. Each time a woman conceived a child, it was\n> like playing a game of roulette. Genetics was never an exact science.\n>\n> But Zufa had been so careful, checking and double-checking the\n> bloodlines. Only one of those conjugal encounters had resulted in a\n> living child--- Norma, a dwarf barely four feet tall, with blocky\n> features, mousy brown hair, and a tedious, bookish personality.\n>\n> Many offspring on Rossak had defective bodies, and even the apparently\n> healthy ones rarely exhibited the strong mental powers of the elite\n> Sorceresses. Nevertheless, Zufa felt deep disappointment, even\n> embarrassment, that *her* daughter had no telepathic skills. The\n> greatest living Sorceress should have been able to pass along her\n> superior mental abilities, and she desperately wanted her daughter to\n> carry on the fight against the machines. But Norma showed no potential\n> whatsoever. And despite Aurelius Venport's impeccable genetic\n> credentials, Zufa had never been able to carry one of his babies to\n> term.\n>\n> *How many more times must I keep trying before I replace him with\n> another breeder?* Once more, she decided--- she would attempt to get\n> pregnant again, within the next few months. It would be Venport's last\n> chance.\n>\n> Zufa was also disappointed in Norma's independence and defiance. Too\n> often the teenager spun off on obscure mathematical tangents that no\n> one could comprehend. Norma seemed lost in her own world.\n>\n> *My daughter, you should have been so much more!*\n>\n> No one had a heavier burden of responsibility than the small clan of\n> Sorceresses on the planet, and Zufa's burden was the greatest of all.\n> If only she could count on everyone else, especially in light of this\n> latest danger from the cymeks.\n>\n> Since stunted Norma could never take part in the mental battle, Zufa\n> had to concentrate on her daughters in spirit, those few young women\n> who had won the \"genetic lottery\" and acquired superior mental\n> abilities. Zufa would train and encourage them, showing them how to\n> eradicate the enemy.\n>\n> From her cliffside perch, she watched her lover Aurelius and young\n> Norma reach the other side of the suspension bridge and begin to\n> negotiate a circular network of ladders that led to the deeply\n> shadowed jungle floor. Like two happy-go-lucky outcasts, Norma and\n> Aurelius had grown close emotionally, using one another as crutches.\n>\n> Engrossed in their own petty concerns that had nothing to do with\n> victory, neither of them had even noticed Zufa's return on the\n> shuttle. No doubt the two misfits would spend hours poking through the\n> foliage in search of new drug resources, which Aurelius would\n> incorporate into his business ventures.\n>\n> The Sorceress shook her head, not understanding his priorities. Those\n> drugs the men developed were of little more use than Norma's arcane\n> mathematics. Admittedly, Aurelius was a highly intelligent and skilled\n> businessman, but what good were enormous profits if free humanity was\n> doomed to enslavement?\n>\n> Disappointed in both of them, knowing that she and her Sorceresses\n> would have to do the real fighting, Zufa set out to find the most\n> powerful young women she had recruited to learn the devastating new\n> technique she planned to unleash against the cymeks.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AS NORMA FOLLOWED him through the fleshy underbrush, Aurelius consumed\n> capsules of a focused stimulant that his expert chemists had\n> synthesized from the pungent pheromones of a boulder-sized burrowing\n> beetle. Venport felt stronger, his perceptions sharpened, his reflexes\n> enhanced. Not quite like the telepathic powers of icy Zufa, but better\n> than his natural abilities.\n>\n> Someday he would make a breakthrough, allowing him to meet the\n> powerful Sorceress on his own terms. Maybe he and Norma would do it\n> together.\n>\n> Aurelius maintained a benign fondness for the girl's stern mother. He\n> tolerated Zufa's moods and scornful attitude with good grace; Rossak\n> women rarely allowed themselves the luxury of romantic love.\n>\n> Though Aurelius knew full well that Zufa had selected him for his\n> breeding potential, he saw through the woman's stoic, demanding\n> exterior. Attempting to conceal her weaknesses, the powerful Sorceress\n> showed her doubts on occasion, afraid that she could not fulfill the\n> responsibilities she had placed on herself. Once, when Aurelius\n> commented that he knew how strong she was trying to be, Zufa had grown\n> embarrassed and angry. \"Somebody has to be strong\" was all she had\n> said.\n>\n> Since he lacked telepathic ability, Zufa had little interest in\n> engaging him in conversation. Perhaps she recognized his skills as a\n> businessman, investor, and politician, but she valued none of those\n> abilities as much as her own narrow goals. The Sorceress frequently\n> tried to make him feel like a failure, but her derision only served to\n> ignite his ambition, especially his desire to find a drug that would\n> give him telepathic powers equivalent to her own.\n>\n> There were other ways to fight a war.\n>\n> The silvery-purple jungles offered a treasure-trove to cure diseases,\n> expand the mind, and improve human abilities. The choices were\n> overwhelming, but Aurelius sought to investigate everything. From\n> proper development and marketing, the products of Rossak had already\n> put him on the path to great wealth. He was even grudgingly respected\n> by a number of the Sorceresses--- except by his own mate.\n>\n> As a visionary entrepreneur, he was accustomed to exploring\n> alternatives. Like paths through a dense jungle, many routes could\n> lead to the same place. Sometimes, one just had to hack through with a\n> machete.\n>\n> So far, though, the right drug eluded him.\n>\n> In another venture, he had proudly distributed Norma's exotic\n> mathematical work among scholarly scientific circles. Though he didn't\n> understand her theorems, he had a gut feeling that she might come up\n> with something important. Maybe she had already done so, and it took\n> expert eyes to recognize it. Venport liked the intense girl, acting as\n> a big brother to her. As far as he was concerned, Norma was a\n> mathematical prodigy, so who cared about her height or her appearance?\n> He was willing to give her a chance, even if her mother never would.\n>\n> Beside him, Norma studied the design of a broad purple leaf, using a\n> light-beam caliper to measure its various dimensions and the\n> relationships among angles in the sap-filled veins. The depth of her\n> concentration added a wistful cast to her plain features.\n>\n> Glancing back at him, Norma said in a surprisingly mature voice, \"This\n> leaf has been designed and constructed by the Earth mother Gaia, or\n> the Master Creator God, or Buddallah, or whatever you want to call\n> it.\" With blunt fingers, she held up the fleshy leaf and passed a beam\n> of light through it, so that the intricate cellular designs showed\n> clearly. \"Patterns within patterns, all tied together in complex\n> relationships.\"\n>\n> In his drug-enhanced, euphoric state, Aurelius found the design\n> hypnotic. \"God is in everything,\" he said. The stimulant he had taken\n> seemed to supercharge his synapses. He squinted through the\n> illuminated fabric of the leaf as she pointed to the internal shapes.\n>\n> \"God is the mathematician of the universe. There is an ancient\n> correlation known as the Golden Mean, a pleasing ratio of form and\n> structure that is found in this leaf, in seashells, and in the living\n> creatures of many planets. It is the tiniest part of the key, known\n> since the time of the Greeks and Egyptians of Earth. They used it in\n> their architecture and pyramids, in their Pythagorean pentagram and\n> Fibonacci sequence.\" She discarded the leaf. \"But there is so much\n> more.\"\n>\n> Nodding, Venport touched a moistened fingertip to a pouch of fine\n> black powder at his belt; he rubbed the powder under the sensitive\n> tissue of his tongue and felt another drug penetrating his senses,\n> merging with the remnants of the last one. Norma kept talking; though\n> he did not follow her logical development, he was certain the\n> revelations must be fabulous.\n>\n> \"Give me a practical example,\" he slurred. \"Something with a function\n> that I can understand.\"\n>\n> He had grown accustomed to Norma spouting off obscure formulations.\n> Her basis might have been in classical geometry, but she applied her\n> knowledge in much more complex ways. \"I can envision calculations all\n> the way to infinity,\" she said, as if in a trance. \"I don't have to\n> write them down.\"\n>\n> *And she doesn't even need mind-enhancement drugs to accomplish it,*\n> Aurelius marveled.\n>\n> \"At this very moment I envision a huge and efficient structure that\n> could be built at a reasonable cost, tens of kilometers long--- and\n> based upon the ratio of the Golden Mean.\"\n>\n> \"But who would ever need something so immense?\"\n>\n> \"I cannot peer into the future, Aurelius.\" Norma teased him. Then they\n> trudged deeper into the weird jungle, still curious and intent on what\n> they might discover. Norma's face was radiant with energy. \"But there\n> might be something . . . something I haven't thought of yet.\"\n>\n> *Careful preparations and defenses can never guarantee* *victory.*\n>\n> *However, ignoring these precautions is an almost certain recipe for\n> defeat.*\n>\n> ---*League Armada Strategy Manual*\n>\n> **F**or four months, Tercero Xavier Harkonnen and his six Armada\n> survey vessels traveled along a predetermined route, stopping to\n> inspect and assess the military facilities and defensive preparations\n> of the League Worlds. After many years of no more than a few\n> skirmishes, no one knew where Omnius might strike next.\n>\n> Xavier had never wavered from the difficult decision he'd made during\n> the cymek attack on Zimia. The Viceroy had praised him for his nerve\n> and determination; even so, Manion Butler had wisely sent the young\n> officer away during the major rebuilding activities, giving Salusans\n> time to heal their wounds without looking for a scapegoat.\n>\n> Xavier listened to no excuses from tightwad nobles unwilling to commit\n> the necessary resources. No expense must be spared. Any free world\n> that fell to machine aggression would be a loss for the entire human\n> race.\n>\n> The survey ships traveled from the mines of Hagal to the broad river\n> plains of Poritrin, then made their way to Seneca where the weather\n> was poor and the rain so corrosive that even thinking machines would\n> break down soon after a conquest.\n>\n> The League planets of Relicon followed, then Kirana III, then Richese,\n> with its burgeoning high-tech industries that made so many other\n> League noblemen uneasy. In theory, the sophisticated manufacturing\n> devices contained no computerization or artificial intelligence, but\n> there were always questions, always doubts.\n>\n> Finally Xavier's team arrived at their final inspection stop, Giedi\n> Prime. At last, his tour was about to end. He could return home, see\n> Serena again, and they could make good on their promises to each\n> other. . . .\n>\n> All other League Worlds had installed scrambler field towers. The\n> shields' known weakness against cymeks did not completely devalue\n> Holtzman's ingenious work, and the costly barriers still provided\n> substantial protection against all-out thinking machine offensives. In\n> addition, every human world had long ago built up enormous stockpiles\n> of atomics as part of a doomsday defense. With so many nuclear\n> warheads, an iron-willed planetary governor could turn his world into\n> slag rather than allowing it to fall to Omnius.\n>\n> Although the thinking machines also had access to atomics, Omnius had\n> concluded that atomics were an inefficient and nonselective way to\n> impose control, and radioactive cleanup afterward was difficult.\n> Besides, with unlimited resources and a deep reservoir of patience,\n> the relentless evermind had no need of such weapons.\n>\n> Now, as Xavier disembarked from the lead survey ship at the Giedi City\n> spaceport, he blinked under bright sunlight. The well-maintained\n> metropolis sprawled in front of him, with its habitation complexes and\n> productive industrial buildings amid manicured parks and canals. The\n> colors were bright and fresh, and flowers bloomed in ornate beds,\n> although with his new Tlulaxa lungs and tissues he could smell only a\n> hint of the most potent scents, even when he breathed deeply.\n>\n> \"This would be a fine place to bring Serena one day,\" he said\n> wistfully as he stood in the heat-shimmer of spaceship exhaust. If he\n> married her, perhaps this would be a suitable world for their\n> honeymoon. During the current inspection tour, he had kept his eyes\n> open, trying to find a likely spot.\n>\n> After four months in space, Xavier missed Serena terribly. He knew the\n> two of them were destined for each other. His life operated on a\n> smooth, clearly defined path. When he returned to Salusa, he promised\n> himself that he would formalize their betrothal. He saw no point in\n> waiting any longer.\n>\n> Viceroy Butler already treated him like a son, and the young officer\n> had received the blessing of his adoptive father Emil Tantor. As far\n> as Xavier\n>\n> could determine, everyone in the League agreed it would be a fine\n> joining of noble houses.\n>\n> He smiled, thinking of Serena's face, of her intriguing lavender eyes\n> . . . and then looked across the landing field to see Magnus Sumi\n> approaching the survey ships. The elected leader was accompanied by a\n> dozen members of the Giedi Prime Home Guard.\n>\n> The Magnus was a thin man in late middle age with pale skin and\n> gray-blond hair that hung to his shoulders. Sumi raised a hand. \"Ah,\n> Tercero Harkonnen! We welcome the League Armada and are eager to see\n> how Giedi Prime can improve its defenses against the thinking\n> machines.\"\n>\n> Xavier snapped a stiff bow in return. \"Your cooperation pleases me,\n> Eminence. Against Omnius, we must not use low-cost materials or\n> stopgap systems that would not adequately protect your people.\"\n>\n> After the Battle of Zimia, Xavier's corps of engineers had made\n> requests for mandatory strategic improvements throughout the League.\n> The nobles dug into their coffers, increasing taxes on their subjects\n> and spending the necessary money to build up their defenses. At each\n> stop, planet after planet, month after month, Xavier had assigned\n> teams of engineers and Armada troops where he deemed they were most\n> needed.\n>\n> Soon, though, he would be going back home. *Soon*. As the time drew\n> near, he thought of Serena more and more.\n>\n> Well dressed and well armed, the Home Guard stood at attention around\n> the survey ships. Magnus Sumi gestured for Xavier to follow him. \"I\n> look forward to clarifying everything over a sumptuous banquet,\n> Tercero Harkonnen. I've set up twelve fine courses with dancers,\n> musicians, and our best poets. You and I can relax in my government\n> residence while we discuss plans. I am certain you must be weary from\n> your journey. How long can you stay with us?\"\n>\n> Xavier could form only a tight smile, thinking of how far away he was\n> from Salusa Secundus. Even after leaving Giedi Prime, the ships would\n> still need\n>\n> another month of fast space travel to return home. The sooner he\n> departed here, the sooner he could hold Serena in his arms again.\n>\n> \"Eminence, this is the final stop on our long tour. If it pleases you,\n> I would prefer to spend less time with festivities and more on the\n> inspection.\" He gestured toward his survey ship. \"We have a schedule\n> to keep. I'm afraid I can allot only two days for Giedi Prime. It is\n> best that we concentrate on our work.\"\n>\n> The Magnus looked crestfallen. \"Yes, I suppose celebration is not\n> appropriate after the damage done to Salusa Secundus.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> FOR TWO DAYS, Xavier gave the planetary defenses a quick, almost\n> cursory inspection. He found Giedi Prime to be a dazzling and\n> prosperous world with many resources, perhaps even a suitable place to\n> settle down and start an estate of his own one day.\n>\n> He gave a favorable assessment, accompanied by a warning. \"This is\n> undoubtedly a planet the thinking machines will want to conquer,\n> Eminence.\" He studied the city blueprints and the distribution of\n> resources across the main continents. \"Any cymek attack would most\n> likely attempt to keep the industries intact so that robots could\n> exploit them. Omnius preaches efficiency.\"\n>\n> Beside him, Magnus Sumi reacted with pride. He pointed out substations\n> on the diagrams. \"We intend to install secondary field-transmitting\n> towers at several strategic points.\" As he spoke, highlights appeared\n> on the blueprint screen. \"We have already built a completely redundant\n> transmitting station on one of the uninhabited islands in the northern\n> sea, which can provide full overlap from a polar projection. We hope\n> to have it online within another month.\"\n>\n> Xavier nodded distractedly, his mind weary from months of such\n> details. \"I am glad to hear that, though I doubt a second transmitting\n> complex is entirely necessary.\"\n>\n> \"We want to feel safe, Tercero.\"\n>\n> When the two men stood under silvery parabolic towers that throbbed\n> into the sky over Giedi City, Xavier paced around the plascrete\n> embankments that blocked access to large vehicles. He had no doubt a\n> cymek warrior could easily crash through.\n>\n> \"Eminence, I suggest you station more ground troops and obstacles\n> here. Increase your planetside missile-defense batteries to protect\n> against any intrusion from space. On Salusa, the cymek strategy was to\n> focus their entire attack on the destruction of the towers, and they\n> might try that again.\" He rapped his knuckles against the tower's\n> heavy paristeel support pillar. \"These shields are your first and last\n> line of defense, your most effective blockade against thinking\n> machines. Do not neglect them.\"\n>\n> \"Indeed. Our munitions factories are building heavy artillery and\n> armored ground vehicles. As soon as possible, we intend to surround\n> this complex with a large concentration of military power.\"\n>\n> As for the uncompleted secondary generating station, it was too\n> isolated to be protected from a massive assault. But its existence\n> seemed to comfort the Magnus and his populace.\n>\n> \"Very good,\" Xavier said, then glanced at the chronometer on his\n> wrist. Everything was going so well, perhaps his survey ships could\n> depart before sunset. . . .\n>\n> The Magnus continued, his voice uncertain, \"Tercero, are you concerned\n> about Giedi Prime's limited space military defenses? Our Home Guard\n> has few large ships in orbit to drive back an approaching machine\n> fleet, and our picket ships and scouts are minimal. I admit to feeling\n> vulnerable in that area. What if Omnius attacks us directly from\n> orbit?\"\n>\n> \"You have ground-based missile defenses in place, and they have always\n> proved reliable.\" Impatient, Xavier looked up into the clear sky. \"I\n> believe your best hope is to protect your shield complex here on the\n> ground. No quantity of Armada battleships can match the deterrent\n> power of scrambler\n>\n> shields. When the robot fleet attacking Salusa realized they could not\n> take down the scramblers, they retreated.\"\n>\n> \"But what if they blockade Giedi Prime from orbit?\"\n>\n> \"Your world is self-sufficient enough to wait out any siege until the\n> arrival of a League rescue force.\" Anxious to be back at the\n> spaceport, Xavier decided to appease the governor. \"Nevertheless, I\n> will recommend that a javelin-class destroyer or two be stationed\n> around Giedi Prime.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THAT EVENING, THE Magnus threw a departure banquet for the Armada\n> service performed on his behalf. \"Someday,\" he said, \"we may all thank\n> you for our lives.\"\n>\n> Xavier excused himself midway through the meal. The food and wine\n> seemed to lack taste. \"My apologies, Eminence, but my squadron must\n> not miss the optimal departure window.\" He bowed at the doorway, then\n> hurried to his vessel. Some of his troops would have liked to remain\n> longer, but most were also eager to get home. They had their own\n> sweethearts and families, and these soldiers had more than earned\n> furloughs.\n>\n> With his inspection tour behind him, Xavier left lovely Giedi Prime,\n> confident that he had seen and done everything necessary.\n>\n> And completely unaware of the vulnerabilities he had not bothered to\n> discover. . . .\n>\n> *In the process of becoming slaves to machines, we transferred\n> technical knowledge to them--- without imparting proper value\n> systems.*\n\n--- PRIMERO FAYKAN BUTLER,\n\n*Memoirs of the Jihad*\n\n> **T**he *Dream Voyager* neared Earth, humanity's original home and now\n> the central Synchronized World.

Heavy\n> pincers clacked.\n>\n> Vorian waved and rushed forward. \"Father!\"\n>\n> Since cymeks regularly exchanged temporary bodies in response to the\n> physical requirements of various activities, they were difficult to\n> distinguish from each other. However, Vor's father came to see him\n> whenever the *Dream Voyager* returned from its update-delivery\n> missions.\n>\n> Many enslaved humans lived on the Synchronized Worlds, serving the\n> evermind.

But he was pleased that even these lesser people had\n> tasks they could perform in order to earn their subsistence.\n>\n> \"Seurat told me about Salusa Secundus, Father.\" He maintained a quick\n> pace to match the cymek's huge strides. \"I'm sorry your assault was\n> unsuccessful.\"\n>\n> \"Just a test case,\" Agamemnon said. \"The feral humans have a new\n> defensive system, and now we have probed it.\"\n>\n> Vor beamed. \"I'm sure you'll discover a way to bring all *hrethgir*\n> under the efficient rule of Omnius. Like the times described in your\n> memoirs, when Titans were in complete control.\"\n>\n> Inwardly, the cymek general frowned at the comments. Agamemnon's optic\n> threads detected numerous watcheyes floating around them as the two\n> walked. \"I do not wish for the old days, of course,\" he said,\n> presently. \"You have been reading my memoirs again?\"\n>\n> \"I never tire of your stories, Father. The Time of Titans, the great\n> Tlaloc, the First Hrethgir Rebellions . . . everything is so\n> fascinating.\" Accompanying the magnificent cymek made Vor feel\n> special.

I have only\n> recently arrived back on Earth.\"\n>\n> With human ambitions still a fundamental part of their psyches, the\n> Titans always had monumental construction projects under way:\n> megalithic buildings and monuments to themselves that celebrated the\n> lost age of humanity and glorified the Time of Titans. Captive human\n> artists and\n>\n> architects were ordered to develop original designs and sketches that\n> the cymeks modified or approved.\n>\n> Nearby, machinery lifted the components of skyscraper buildings into\n> place, adding upper floors to existing complexes, though the thinking\n> machines had little need for further expansion. At times, the\n> extravagant construction seemed to Vor like mere busy-work for the\n> slaves. . . .\n>\n> He had never known his mother, and understood only that ages ago,\n> before the Titans had surgically converted themselves into cymeks,\n> Agamemnon had created his own sperm bank, from which he had germinated\n> Vorian. Over the centuries, the general could create any number of\n> offspring using acceptable surrogate mothers.\n>\n> Though he had never learned about any siblings, Vorian suspected they\n> were out there somewhere. He wondered what it would be like to meet\n> them, but in machine society, emotional attachments were not\n> practical. He only hoped that his siblings had not proven to be\n> disappointments to Agamemnon.\n>\n> When his father was off on his frequent missions, Vor often tried to\n> talk with the remaining Titans, curious about the events recorded in\n> Agamemnon's celebrated and voluminous memoirs. He used his responsible\n> position to better himself. Some of the original cymeks--- especially\n> Ajax--- were arrogant and treated Vor as a nuisance. Others, like Juno\n> or Barbarossa, found him amusing. All of them spoke with utmost\n> passion about Tlaloc, the first of the great Titans, who had sparked\n> the revolution.\n>\n> \"I wish I'd been able to meet Tlaloc,\" Vor said, trying to keep the\n> conversation going. Agamemnon loved to speak of his glory days.\n>\n> \"Yes, Tlaloc was a dreamer with ideas I had never heard before,\" the\n> cymek mused as he strode down the boulevards. \"At times he was a bit\n> na\u00efve, not always understanding the practical repercussions of his\n> ideas. But I pointed them out to him. That was why we made such a\n> great team.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon seemed to pick up speed when he spoke of the Titans. Weary\n> from trying to keep up the rapid pace, Vorian gasped for breath.\n>\n> \"Tlaloc took his name from an ancient rain god. Among the Titans,\n> Tlaloc was our visionary, while I was the military commander. Juno was\n> our tactician and manipulator. Dante watched over statistics,\n> bureaucracy, and population-accounting. Barbarossa saw to the\n> reprogramming of the thinking machines, making certain they had the\n> same goals as we did. He gave them ambition.\"\n>\n> \"And a good thing, too,\" Vorian said.\n>\n> Agamemnon hesitated, but did not voice any objections, wary of the\n> watcheyes. \"When he visited Earth, Tlaloc realized how the human race\n> had gone stagnant, how people had become so dependent on machines that\n> they had nothing left but apathy. Their goals were gone, their drive,\n> their passion. When they should have had nothing to do but unleash\n> their creative impulses, they were too lazy to perform even the work\n> of the imagination.\" His vocal speakers made a disgusted sound.\n>\n> \"But Tlaloc was different,\" Vor said, on cue.\n>\n> The cymek's voice took on more emotion. \"Tlaloc grew up in the Thalim\n> system, on an outer colony world where life was difficult, where labor\n> was not accomplished without sweat, blood, and blisters. He had to\n> fight his way and earn his position. On Earth, he saw that the human\n> spirit had all but died---*and the people hadn't even noticed!*\n>\n> \"He gave speeches attempting to rally the humans, to make them see\n> what was happening. A few watched him with interest, considering him a\n> novelty.\" Agamemnon raised one of his powerful metal arms. \"But they\n> heard his words only as a diversion. Soon the bored audiences returned\n> to their slothful, hedonistic pursuits.\"\n>\n> \"But not you, Father.\"\n>\n> \"I was dissatisfied with my uneventful life. I had already met Juno,\n> and the two of us had dreams. Tlaloc crystallized them for us. After\n> Juno and I joined him, we set in motion the events that led to the\n> downfall of the Old Empire.\"\n>\n> Father and son arrived at the central complex where the Earth-Omnius\n> resided, although redundant nodes of the evermind were distributed\n> around the planet in a network of armored vaults and high towers.\n> Vorian followed the cymek into the main structure, eager to do his\n> part. This was a ritual they had completed many times.\n>\n> The walker body strode through wide halls and entered a maintenance\n> facility filled with lubricant tubes, bubbling nutrient cylinders,\n> polished tabletops, and flickering analysis systems. Vor retrieved a\n> tool kit, then turned on vacuum hoses and high-pressure water jets,\n> found soft rags and polishing lotions. He considered it his most\n> important task as a trustee.\n>\n> In the center of the sterile room, Agamemnon halted beneath a lifting\n> apparatus. A magnetic claw-hand came down and attached itself to the\n> preservation canister that held his ancient brain. Neural connection\n> ports popped open, and thoughtrode cables spiraled away. The lifting\n> arm raised the canister, still attached to temporary batteries and\n> life-support systems.\n>\n> Vorian came forward with an armload of equipment. \"I know you can't\n> feel this, Father, but I like to think it makes you more comfortable\n> and efficient.\" He blasted the connection ports with high-pressure air\n> and streams of warm water, using a wadded cloth to polish every\n> surface. The cymek general transmitted wordless gratified murmurings.\n>\n> Vor completed the cleaning and polishing, then adjusted wires and\n> cables and hooked up diagnostics. \"All functions optimal, Father.\"\n>\n> \"With your attentive maintenance, it is no wonder. Thank you, my son.\n> You take such good care of me.\"\n>\n> \"It is my honor to do so.\"\n>\n> His synthesized voice purring, Agamemnon said, \"One day, Vorian, if\n> you continue serving me so well, I will recommend you for the greatest\n> reward. I will ask Omnius to surgically convert you into a cymek, like\n> me.\"\n>\n> At the mention of this wonderful prospect, Vorian again polished the\n> canister, then looked lovingly at the creamy contours of the brain\n> inside. He tried to hide his flush of eager embarrassment, but tears\n> came to his eyes. \"That is the best a human can hope for.\"\n>\n> *Humans, with such fragile physical forms, are easily crushed. Is it\n> any challenge to hurt or damage them?*\n\n--- ERASMUS,\n\nuncollated laboratory files\n\n> **G**azing out upon the skies of Earth again through hundreds of\n> appraising optic threads, Erasmus was not pleased. The robot stood in\n> a high bell tower of his villa, staring through a curving expanse of\n> armored windowplate. The landscape of this world, with its oceans and\n> forests and cities built upon the bones of other cities had already\n> seen countless civilizations rise and fall. The scope of history made\n> his own accomplishments seem small and contrived.\n>\n> Therefore, he would have to try harder.\n>\n> Neither Omnius nor any of his delegated architect robots understood\n> true beauty. To Erasmus, the buildings and the layout of the rebuilt\n> city resembled components with sharp angles, abrupt discontinuities. A\n> city must be more than an efficient circuit diagram. Under his\n> multiphased scrutiny, the metropolis looked like an elaborate\n> mechanism, designed and constructed with utilitarian force. It had its\n> own clean lines and systematic efficiency, which resulted in a\n> completely serendipitous beauty . . . but there was no finesse\n> whatsoever.\n>\n> It was such a disappointment when the omniscient evermind refused to\n> live up to his potential. Sometimes, gloriously unrealistic human\n> ambitions had a certain merit.\n>\n> Omnius either ignored or intentionally refuted the graceful beauty of\n> Golden Age human architecture. But such cold and petulant superiority\n> was not logical. Admittedly, Erasmus could see a certain beauty in\n> streamlined machines and components--- he rather liked his own\n> burnished platinum skinfilm, the smooth grace of his mirrored face\n> with which he formed facial\n>\n> expressions. But he saw no point in maintaining ugliness just to spite\n> a perceived enemy's concept of beauty.\n>\n> How could a vast computer mind distributed across hundreds of planets\n> exhibit even a hint of narrow-mindedness? To Erasmus, with his\n> detached and mature understanding developed through long\n> contemplation, Omnius's attitude revealed a lack of comprehensive\n> thinking.\n>\n> Making the sound of an exaggerated sigh that he had copied from\n> humans, he transmitted a thought-command that caused projection shades\n> to drop over the windows in the bell tower. Choosing his mood, he\n> projected artificial, pastoral views from other worlds. So soothing\n> and peaceful.\n>\n> On one wall he paused at a clothing synthesizer, selected the design\n> he wanted, and waited while a garment was prepared for him. A\n> traditional painter's smock. When it was ready, he draped it over his\n> sleek body and crossed the room to an easel where he had already set\n> up a blank canvas, a palette of paints, and fine brushes.\n>\n> At a wave of his hand, the projection shades shifted to display\n> enlarged images of masterpiece paintings, each one highlighting a\n> different great master. He selected \"Cottages at Cordeville\" by an\n> ancient Earth artist, Vincent Van Gogh. It was bold and colorful but\n> basically crude in its implementation, with inept lines and childish\n> pigment applications that featured thick globs of paint and smears of\n> color. Yet when considered as a whole, the painting itself possessed a\n> certain raw energy, an indefinable primitive vibrancy.\n>\n> After deep concentration, Erasmus thought he had a delicate\n> understanding of Van Gogh's technique. But the comprehension of *why*\n> anyone would want to create it in the first place eluded him.\n>\n> Although he had never painted before, he copied the artwork exactly.\n>\n> Brushstroke for brushstroke, pigment for pigment. When he was\n> finished,\n>\n> Erasmus examined his masterpiece. \"There, the sincerest form of\n> flattery.\"\n>\n> The nearest wall-mounted screen brightened to a pale gray wash of\n> light. Omnius had been watching, as always. Erasmus would no doubt\n> have to justify his activities, since the evermind would never\n> understand what the independent robot was doing.\n>\n> He studied the painting again. Why was it so hard to understand\n> creativity? Should he just change some of the components at random and\n> call it an original work? As the robot finished his scrutiny,\n> satisfied that he had made no mistakes, that he had not deviated from\n> the tolerances he could see in the image of the painting, Erasmus\n> waited for a rush of comprehension.\n>\n> Slowly, he came to realize that what he had just completed was not\n> really *art*, any more than a printing press created literature. He\n> had only *copied* the ancient composition in every detail. He had\n> added nothing, synthesized no newness. And he burned with the need to\n> understand the difference.\n>\n> Frustrated, Erasmus took a different tack. In an implacable voice, he\n> summoned three servants and ordered them to carry his painting\n> supplies out to one of the laboratory buildings. \"I intend to create a\n> new work of art, all my own. A still life, of sorts. You three will be\n> vital parts of the process. Rejoice in your good fortune.\"\n>\n> In the sterile environment of the laboratory, with the cold assistance\n> of his personal robot guards, Erasmus proceeded to vivisect the trio\n> of victims, oblivious to their screams. \"I want to get to the heart of\n> the matter,\" he quipped, \"the lifeblood of it.\"\n>\n> With stained metal hands he studied the dripping organs, squeezed\n> them, watched their juices flow and cellular structures collapse. He\n> performed a cursory analysis, discovering sloppy mechanics and\n> inefficient circulatory systems that were unnecessarily complex and\n> prone to failure.\n>\n> Then, feeling a vibrant energy, an *impulsiveness*, Erasmus set up a\n> tableau to paint. A new work, completely unique! It would be his own\n> arrangement, and he would tint the images using different filters,\n> making a few intentional mistakes to better approximate human\n> imperfection and uncertainty.\n>\n> At last, he must be on the right track.\n>\n> At his command, the sentinel robots brought in a vat filled with\n> fresh, uncoagulated human blood. Erasmus began removing the\n> interesting array of human organs--- still warm to the touch--- from\n> his table, and instructed two cleaning drones to scrape out the\n> insides from the donor bodies. Contemplating the arrangement and\n> order, he dropped organ after organ into the blood and watched them\n> bob in the liquid--- eyes, livers, kidneys, hearts.\n>\n> Slowly assessing each step of the process, he set up exactly what his\n> \"creative urges\" told him to do. Whim upon whim. Erasmus added more\n> ingredients to the grisly stew. Pursuant to something he had learned\n> about the artist Van Gogh, he sliced an ear off one of the corpses and\n> tossed it into the vat as well.\n>\n> Finally, his metal hands dripping gore, he stepped back. A beautiful\n> arrangement--- one that was totally original to him. He could think of\n> no famous human artist who had worked on such a canvas. No one else\n> had ever done anything approaching this.\n>\n> Erasmus wiped his smooth metallic hands and began to paint upon a\n> virgin canvas. On the blank medium, he astutely drew one of the three\n> hearts, showing in perfect detail the ventricals, auricles, and aorta.\n> But this was not meant to be a realistic dissection image.\n> Dissatisfied, he smeared some of the lines to add an artistic flair.\n> True art required the right amount of uncertainty, just as gourmet\n> cooking needed the proper spices and flavors.\n>\n> This must be how creativity worked. As he painted, Erasmus tried to\n> imagine the kinesthetic relationship between his brain and his\n> mechanical fingers, the thought impulses that set the fingers into\n> motion.\n>\n> \"Is *that* what the humans define as art?\" Omnius said from a\n> wallscreen.\n>\n> For once, Erasmus did not debate with the evermind. Omnius was correct\n> in his skepticism. Erasmus had not attained true creativity. Yes, he\n> had produced an original and graphic arrangement. But in human\n> artwork, the\n>\n> sum of the components added up to more than the individual items. Just\n> ripping organs from victims, floating them in blood, and painting them\n> brought him no closer to understanding human inspiration. Even if he\n> manipulated the details, he remained imprecise and uninspired.\n>\n> Still, this might be a step in the right direction.\n>\n> Erasmus could not carry this thought to the next logical step, and he\n> came to understand why. The process was not ratiocinative at all.\n> Creativity and the precision of analysis were mutually exclusive.\n>\n> Frustrated, the robot gripped the macabre painting in his powerful\n> hands, broke the frame, and tore the canvas to shreds. He would have\n> to do better than this, much better. Erasmus shifted his metallic\n> polymer face to a stylized pensive mask. He was no closer to\n> comprehending humans, despite a century of intensive research and\n> musings.\n>\n> Walking slowly, Erasmus went to his private sanctuary, a botanical\n> garden where he listened to classical music piped through the cellular\n> structures of plants. \"Rhapsody in Blue,\" by a composer of Old Earth.\n>\n> In the contemplative garden, the troubled robot sat in the ruddy\n> sunlight and felt warmth on his metal skin. This was another thing\n> that humans seemed to enjoy, but he did not understand why. Even with\n> his sensory enhancement module, it just seemed like *heat*.\n>\n> And machines that overheated broke down.\n>\n> *The tapestry of the universe is vast and complex, with infinite\n> patterns. While threads of tragedy may form the primary weave,\n> humanity with its undaunted optimism still manages to embroider small\n> designs of happiness and love.*\n>\n> --- COGITOR KWYNA,\n\nCity of Introspection archives\n\n> **A**fter his long sojourn in space, Xavier could think only of being\n> home, and back in the warm embrace of Serena Butler.\n>\n> On furlough, he returned to the Tantor estate where he was welcomed by\n> his adoptive parents and their enthusiastic son Vergyl. The Tantors\n> were a soft-spoken older couple, gentle and intelligent, with dark\n> skin and hair the color of thick smoke. Xavier seemed to be cut from\n> the same mold, with similar interests and high moral values. He had\n> grown up in this warm and spacious manor house, which he still\n> considered home. Though he had legally inherited other Harkonnen\n> holdings--- mining and industrial operations on three planets--- many\n> rooms in the Tantor mansion were still set aside for his use.\n>\n> As he entered his familiar large suite, Xavier found a pair of shaggy\n> gray wolfhounds awaiting him, wagging their tails. He dropped his bags\n> and wrestled with the dogs. The animals, larger than his little\n> brother, were always playful and delighted to see him.\n>\n> That evening, the family feasted on the cook's specialty of sage fowl\n> roasted with honey, slivered nuts, and olives from the Tantors' own\n> groves. Unfortunately, after his exposure to the cymeks' searing gas,\n> the subtle nuances of flavors and aromas now eluded him. The cook gave\n> him an alarmed look when he dumped salt and seasoning--- which he\n> needed to taste anything at all--- onto the delicate food.\n>\n> Another thing the thinking machines had taken from him.\n>\n> Afterward, Xavier lounged in a heavy oak chair before a roaring fire,\n> sipping a red wine from the Tantor family vineyards--- also,\n> unfortunately, nearly tasteless. He luxuriated in relaxing at home,\n> away from military protocol. He had spent almost half a year aboard\n> the efficient but bare-bones Armada survey ships; tonight he would\n> sleep like a babe in his own bedchamber.\n>\n> One of the gray wolfhounds snored loudly, resting a furry muzzle on\n> Xavier's stockinged feet. Emil Tantor, with a fringe of smoky hair\n> around his bald crown, sat in the chair opposite his adopted son. Emil\n> asked about the strategic positions of the Synchronized Worlds and the\n> military capabilities of the Armada. \"What are the chances of the war\n> escalating after the attack on Zimia? Can we ever do more than drive\n> them back?\"\n>\n> Xavier finished his wine, poured another half glass for himself and a\n> full one for the older man, then sat back in the chair again, all\n> without disturbing the gray dog. \"The situation looks grim, Father.\"\n> Barely remembering his own parents, he had always called the Tantor\n> lord his father. \"But, then, it has always looked grim, ever since the\n> Time of Titans. Perhaps we lived too comfortably in the days of the\n> Old Empire. We forgot how to be ourselves, how to live up to our\n> potential, and for a thousand years afterward we've paid the price. We\n> were easy prey--- first for evil men, then for soulless machines.\"\n>\n> Emil Tantor sipped his wine, and stared into the fireplace. \"So is\n> there hope, at least? We must have something to cling to.\"\n>\n> Xavier's lips formed a gentle smile. \"We are human, Father. As long as\n> we hold onto that, there is always hope.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THE NEXT DAY Xavier sent a message to the Butler estate, asking\n> permission to accompany the Viceroy's daughter on the annual\n> bristleback hunt, scheduled in two days. Serena would already know\n> that Xavier had returned. His survey ships had arrived with much\n> fanfare, and Manion Butler would have been expecting his note.\n>\n> Still, Salusan society was formal and extravagant. In order to court\n> the beautiful daughter of the Viceroy, one had to bow to certain\n> expectations.\n>\n> In late morning a messenger pounded on the doors of the Tantor manor\n> house; Vergyl stood beside his big brother, grinning when he saw the\n> expression on Xavier's face. \"What is it? Can I come along? Did the\n> Viceroy say yes?\"\n>\n> Xavier made a mock-stern expression. \"How could he possibly turn down\n> the man who saved Salusa Secundus from the cymeks? Remember that,\n> Vergyl, if you ever wish to win the affections of a young lady.\"\n>\n> \"I need to save a *planet* just to have a girlfriend?\" The boy sounded\n> skeptical, though wary of outright disbelief when it came to Xavier's\n> words.\n>\n> \"For a woman as magnificent as Serena, that is exactly what you must\n> do.\" He strode into the great house to tell the Tantors his plans.\n>\n> The next dawn, Xavier dressed in his finest equestrian outfit and rode\n> into brightening daylight toward the Butler property. He borrowed his\n> father's chocolate-brown Salusan stallion, a fine beast with a braided\n> mane, narrow muzzle, and bright eyes. The animal's ears were large,\n> and its gait flowed without the jarring rhythm of less conditioned\n> horses. On the crest of a grassy hill stood a cluster of ornate\n> whitewashed buildings--- a main house, stables, servants' quarters,\n> and storage sheds arranged as outbuildings along the perimeter of a\n> split-rail fence. As his horse climbed, he saw impressive vistas of\n> the white spires of Zimia far behind him.\n>\n> A path paved with crushed limestone wound up to the crest. The gravel\n> crunched under the stallion's hooves as Xavier rode, breathing the\n> crisp air. He could feel the moist chill of early spring, saw fresh\n> leaves on the trees, a dazzle of wildflowers in their first bloom. But\n> each breath he drew into his new lungs smelled flat.\n>\n> Grapevines lined the hill like green corduroy, carefully tended and\n> watered, each vine tied to cables between stakes so that the clusters\n> would hang off the ground for easy picking. Twisted olive trees\n> surrounded the main house,\n>\n> their low branches awash with white flowers. Each year, the first\n> pressings of grapes and olives were cause for feasting in every\n> Salusan household; local vineyards vied against each other to see\n> which could produce the best vintages.\n>\n> As Xavier rode through the gates and into the courtyard, other\n> horsemen in hunting outfits milled about. Barking dogs dodged around\n> the stallion's legs, but the chocolate-brown horse stood majestically,\n> ignoring the hounds as if they were ill-mannered little boys.\n>\n> Contract huntsmen grabbed the leashes and pulled the dogs back into\n> order. A number of short black hunting horses pranced about, as\n> impatient as the dogs. Two of the huntsmen whistled loudly and others\n> joined them, ready to begin the day's festivities.\n>\n> Manion Butler strolled out of the stables, calling up his team like a\n> military commander positioning troops for battle. He glanced at the\n> young officer, raised a hand in greeting.\n>\n> Then Xavier saw Serena riding out on a gray mare with beautiful lines\n> and an ornate saddle. She wore high boots, jodhpurs, and a black\n> riding jacket. Her eyes were like electric sparks as her gaze met his.\n>\n> She cantered over to where Xavier sat astride his mount, a smile\n> forming at the edges of her mouth. Even with all the barking dogs,\n> restless horses, and shouting huntsmen, Xavier wanted to kiss her so\n> badly that he could barely restrain himself. Yet Serena remained\n> coolly formal, extending a gloved hand in greeting. He took it,\n> holding her fingertips.\n>\n> How he wished he could be telepathic like the Sorceresses of Rossak,\n> just to send her his thoughts. But from the obvious delight suffusing\n> her face, he thought Serena understood his feelings well enough, and\n> reciprocated them.\n>\n> \"The journeys across space were so long,\" he said. \"And I thought\n> about you all the time.\"\n>\n> \"*All* the time? You should have been concentrating on your duties.\"\n> She gave him a skeptical smile. \"Perhaps we can find time alone during\n> today's hunt, and you will tell me what you dreamed of.\"\n>\n> Playfully, she urged her gray mare to trot over to where her father\n> waited. Conscious of the eyes watching them, she and Xavier maintained\n> an acceptable distance. He rode forward and clasped her father's\n> black-gloved hand. \"I thank you for allowing me to participate in the\n> hunt, Viceroy.\"\n>\n> Manion Butler's florid face rearranged itself into a grin. \"I'm glad\n> you could join us, Tercero Harkonnen. This year I'm certain we'll\n> track down a bristleback. The beasts are definitely in these woods---\n> and I, for one, have been craving hams and roasts. And bristlebacon,\n> especially. There's nothing like it.\"\n>\n> Her eyes dancing, Serena looked at him. \"Perhaps, Father, if you\n> brought along fewer barking dogs, galloping horses, and men crashing\n> through the underbrush, some of those shy animals would be easier to\n> find.\"\n>\n> In response, Manion smiled as if she were still a precocious little\n> girl. Glancing at Xavier, he said, \"I'm glad you'll be there to\n> protect her, young man.\"\n>\n> The Viceroy raised his right arm. Horns sounded and a brass gong\n> clanged from the stables. The purebred hounds began to bay, clustering\n> toward the far fence. Ahead, the path led beyond the blossoming olive\n> groves and into the scrubby Salusan forest. Two eager-eyed boys swung\n> open the gates, already anticipating their first bristleback hunt.\n>\n> The party rode out like a rowdy gang, dogs pushing first through the\n> gates, followed by the big horses that carried the professional\n> huntsmen. Manion Butler rode with them, blowing an antique bugle that\n> had been with his family since Bovko Manresa's first settlement on\n> Salusa.\n>\n> The followers rode lesser mounts, hurrying behind the horses. These\n> helper crews would set up camp and dress and skin whatever wild game\n> the\n>\n> huntsmen caught. They would also prepare the feast once the party\n> returned to the main house.\n>\n> The hunters had already spread out, with each chief taking a point and\n> plunging into the outskirts of the forest. Unhurried, Xavier and\n> Serena trotted toward the dark green woods. One bright-eyed young man,\n> trailing behind, glanced over his shoulder and winked at Xavier, as if\n> he knew that the young couple had no intention of enjoying the hunt\n> for its own sake.\n>\n> Xavier urged his stallion forward. Serena rode beside him, and they\n> chose their own path through thinning trees to a muddy streambed wet\n> with spring flow. Smiling secretively at each other, they listened to\n> the distant sounds of dogs and her father's continuing bugle blasts.\n>\n> The Butler's private forest covered hundreds of acres, crisscrossed by\n> game trails. Mostly it was left as a preserve, with meadows and\n> sparkling creeks, nesting birds, and lush patches of flowers that\n> bloomed in successive splashes of color as the patches of crusty snow\n> faded.\n>\n> Xavier was simply happy to be alone with Serena. Riding side by side,\n> they brushed arms and shoulders, intentionally. He would reach up to\n> hold green branches away from her face, and Serena pointed out birds\n> and small animals, identifying them.\n>\n> In his comfortable hunting outfit, Xavier carried a sheathed\n> ceremonial dagger, a bullwhip, and a Chandler pistol that shot\n> jacketed crystal fragments. Serena carried her own knife and a small\n> pistol. But neither of them expected to bring down any prey. To them,\n> their hunt was for each other, and both knew it.\n>\n> Serena chose her path without hesitation, as if she had spent time\n> during Xavier's survey mission riding through the forest in search of\n> places where they could be alone. Finally, she led him through a stand\n> of dark pines to a meadow with tall grasses, starlike flowers, and\n> thick reeds taller than her head. The reeds surrounded a mirror-smooth\n> pond, a shallow old tarn created by winter snow melt and refreshed by\n> an underground spring.\n>\n> \"The water has bubbles in it,\" she said. \"It tingles your skin.\"\n>\n> \"Does that mean you want to go for a swim?\" Xavier's throat tightened\n> at the prospect.\n>\n> \"It'll be cold, but the spring has some natural heat. I'm willing to\n> risk it.\" With a smile, Serena dismounted and let her mare graze. She\n> heard a splash out in the pond, but the reeds blocked their view.\n>\n> \"Sounds like a lot of fish, too,\" Xavier said. He slid down from his\n> stallion, patted the muscular neck, and let his mount sniff at the\n> thick grasses and flowers near the gray mare.\n>\n> Serena pulled off her riding boots and stockings, then lifted her\n> loose jodhpurs above her knees as she walked barefoot into the rushes.\n> \"I'm going to test the water.\" She pushed the hollow grasses aside.\n>\n> Xavier checked the fastenings on his stallion's saddle. He worked open\n> one of the leather compartments and brought out a bottle of fresh\n> citrus water to share. He followed Serena toward the reeds, already\n> imagining how it would be to swim beside her, just the two of them\n> stroking naked through this lonely forest lake, kissing each other. .\n> . .\n>\n> Without warning, a monstrous bristleback charged out of the reeds,\n> spraying mud and water from its cool wallowing hole. Serena let out a\n> cry, more of alarm than terror, and fell backward into the mud.\n>\n> The bristleback pawed at the rushes with its cloven hooves. Long tusks\n> protruded from a squarish snout, each a bony maul for uprooting\n> saplings and eviscerating enemies. The animal had wide-set eyes, large\n> and black. It made loud grunts as if preparing to breathe fire. In\n> tales of great bristleback hunts, many men, hunting dogs, and horses\n> had died--- but there were so few of the animals anymore.\n>\n> \"Into the water, Serena!\"\n>\n> The bristleback turned as it heard his shout. Serena did exactly as\n> Xavier said, splashing away from the rushes, deeper into the pond. She\n> began to swim, knowing the boar could not charge her if she was in\n> deep enough water.\n>\n> The bristleback stomped out of the rushes. The two horses squealed and\n> skittered back toward the edge of the meadow.\n>\n> \"Look out, Xavier!\" Waist deep now, Serena drew her hunting knife, but\n> knew she couldn't help him.\n>\n> Xavier planted his legs firmly, held a knife in one hand and the\n> Chandler pistol in the other. Without flinching, he aimed the\n> crystal-shard weapon and shot the bristleback three times in the face.\n> The sharp projectiles tore through the animal's cheek and forehead,\n> gouging the thick skull. Another shot splintered one of the tusks. But\n> the bristleback kept charging toward him, caught up in its own\n> solitary stampede.\n>\n> Xavier fired twice more. The mangled creature bled profusely, mortally\n> wounded--- but even imminent death did not diminish its momentum. As\n> the beast thundered toward him, Xavier jumped to one side and slashed\n> the sharp knife across its throat, opening jugular and carotid\n> vessels. The bristleback turned, gushing blood upon him even as its\n> heart began to fade.\n>\n> The weight of the falling creature knocked Xavier to the ground, but\n> he wrestled it away, avoiding the convulsive thrusts of the razor\n> tusks. The killing done, Xavier climbed back to his feet and staggered\n> away, shivering in shock. His hunting outfit was soaked with the\n> beast's blood.\n>\n> He sprinted into the trampled rushes at the edge of the water.\n> \"Serena!\" \"I'm all right,\" she called, splashing toward the shore.\n>\n> He looked at his reflection in the placid pond, saw his shirt and face\n> covered with gore. He hoped none of it was his own. He cupped his\n> hands and splashed cool water on his skin, then dunked his head to\n> wash the stink from his hair. He scrubbed his hands with peaty sand.\n>\n> Serena came to him, her clothes drenched, wet hair clinging to her\n> skull. She used a corner of her riding jacket to dab the blood from\n> his neck and cheeks. Then she opened his shirt, wiping his chest as\n> well.\n>\n> \"I don't have a scratch on me,\" he said, not sure if it was true. The\n> skin on one side of his neck felt raw and hot, as if chafed, and his\n> chest was sore from the collision with the attacker. He clutched her\n> arm, pulling her closer. \"Are you sure you're not hurt? You aren't\n> cut, no bones broken?\"\n>\n> \"You're asking me?\" she said with teasing disbelief. \"*I'm* not the\n> brave boar fighter here.\"\n>\n> Serena kissed him. Her lips were cold from the water, but he held them\n> against his own, awakening her touch with his until their mouths\n> opened slightly, their breath warm inside each other as the kiss\n> deepened. He took her from the edge of the pond, through the rushes,\n> and to the soft meadow grass, far from the dead bristleback.\n>\n> The young lovers stroked the wet hair away from their ears and eyes,\n> and kissed again. The brush with death made them feel intensely alive.\n> Xavier's skin was hot, and his heart kept pounding, even though the\n> danger was past. A new excitement mounted. He wished he could better\n> enjoy the seductive scent of her perfume, but could detect only a\n> tantalizing thread.\n>\n> Serena's sodden clothes were cold, and Xavier noticed goosebumps on\n> her pale arms. All he could think to do was to remove the wet fabric.\n> \"Here, let me warm you.\"\n>\n> She helped him unfasten the black riding jacket and her blouse while\n> her own fingers worked at his bloodstained shirt. \"Just to make\n> certain you're not hurt,\" Serena said. \"I don't know what I would have\n> done if you'd been killed.\" Her words came fast and hard between\n> kisses.\n>\n> \"It takes more than a wild boar to keep me away from you.\"\n>\n> She yanked his shirt down over his shoulders and fumbled with his cuff\n> so she could take it off entirely. The meadow was soft and lush. The\n> horses\n>\n> munched patiently on grasses as Xavier and Serena made love without\n> restraint, expressing their pent-up passions, whispering and then\n> shouting their love for each other.\n>\n> The rest of the hunting party seemed far away, even though Xavier had\n> killed a bristleback and would have a dramatic story to tell during\n> the evening's feast. Of course, certain details would need to be\n> omitted. . . .\n>\n> For the moment, the war with the thinking machines did not exist. In\n> this brief and heady hour, they were just two human beings, alone and\n> in love.\n>\n> *There is a certain hubris to science, a belief that the more we\n> develop technology and the more we learn, the better our lives will\n> be.*\n>\n> --- TLALOC,\n\n*A Time for Titans*\n\n> **A**nything imagined can be made real . . . given sufficient genius.\n>\n> Tio Holtzman had said as much in a hundred speeches at the Lords\n> Council on Poritrin. His concepts and achievements sparked dreams and\n> fostered confidence in human technological capabilities against the\n> thinking machines.\n>\n> The mantra had also been picked up by his patron, Lord Niko Bludd, and\n> by representatives in the League of Nobles. Early in his career,\n> Holtzman had realized that it was not always the best scientists who\n> received the accolades or funding. Instead, it was the best *showmen*,\n> the most effective politicians.\n>\n> To be sure, Savant Holtzman was an adequate scientist. He had an\n> exceptional technical background and had achieved marked success with\n> his inventions and weapons systems, all of which had been put to good\n> use against Omnius. But he had arranged for more publicity and\n> attention than the inventions themselves warranted. Through his\n> oratory skills and by coloring certain details, he had constructed a\n> pedestal of fame on which he now stood. Holtzman had made himself into\n> the Hero of Poritrin, rather than just another nameless inventor. His\n> ability to enchant audiences, to spark a sense of wonder and\n> possibility in their minds, exceeded his scientific skills.\n>\n> To maintain his mythology, Holtzman constantly hungered for new\n> *ideas*--- which required inspiration and long periods of\n> uninterrupted thought. He liked to let possibilities roll like pebbles\n> down a steep mountain slope. Sometimes the pebbles would come to rest,\n> making a bit of noise but\n>\n> ultimately yielding nothing; on other occasions, such notions might\n> spark an avalanche.\n>\n> *Anything imagined can be made real*.\n>\n> But first it must be imagined, seen in the vision of the creator.\n>\n> After returning home from the devastation on Salusa Secundus, he had\n> booked himself a private cabin aboard a luxurious driftbarge, one of\n> the quiet zeppelin craft that rose from the delta city of Starda and\n> drifted inland on currents of warm air, cruising across the seemingly\n> endless Poritrin plains.\n>\n> Holtzman stood on the driftbarge's open deck, looking at the\n> grasslands that flowed in a sea of green and brown, dappled with\n> lakes. Below him, birds flew like schools of fish. The slow aircraft\n> floated with no hurry, no schedule.\n>\n> He stared toward the open horizon. Limitless distances, endless\n> possibilities. Hypnotic, meditative . . . inspirational. Such places\n> opened his mind, allowed him to pursue crazy concepts and run them\n> down like a predator pursuing prey.\n>\n> The driftbarge passed over geometric shapes like tattoos on the\n> ground, carefully sectioned acreage for the labor-intensive farming of\n> sweet cane. Other fields grew plump grains and fibrous threads to make\n> Poritrin cloth. Armies of human slaves worked the farms and ranches\n> like insects from a hive.\n>\n> Following a bucolic derivative of Navachristianity, the people of\n> Poritrin had outlawed computerized harvesting apparatus and restored\n> their society to humbler roots. Without sophisticated machinery, they\n> required a great deal of manual labor. Long ago, Sajak Bludd had been\n> the first League nobleman to introduce actual slavery as a means of\n> making large-scale agriculture viable.\n>\n> That Poritrin lord had justified his act by choosing only those who\n> owed a debt to humanity, mostly Buddislamic cowards who had fled\n> instead of fighting against the repressive Titans and thinking\n> machines. If they hadn't been afraid to help defend humanity, Sajak\n> Bludd said, their added numbers might have been enough to turn the\n> tide of war. Working the fields was a small enough price for their\n> descendants to pay. . . .\n>\n> Holtzman paced the driftbarge's deck, acquired a fluted glass of\n> sugary juice from a server, and sipped it as he pondered. Looking down\n> at the sea of grasses, he relished his mental sojourn. No distractions\n> . . . but as yet no inspiration, either. The great scientist often\n> embarked on such journeys to pull his thoughts together, simply\n> staring and thinking--- and *working*, though everyone else aboard\n> seemed to be taking a holiday.\n>\n> Because of Holtzman's previous successes, Niko Bludd gave him free\n> reign to develop whatever innovative defenses and weapons struck his\n> fancy. Unfortunately, during the past year the scientist had faced a\n> growing conviction that he was running out of ideas.\n>\n> Genius was nothing without creative impulse. Of course, the Savant\n> could coast for a while on his earlier triumphs. Still, he had to\n> offer up new inventions regularly, or even Lord Bludd would begin to\n> doubt him.\n>\n> Holtzman could never permit that. It was a matter of pride.\n>\n> He'd been embarrassed that the cymeks so easily penetrated his\n> scrambler shields on Salusa Secundus. How could he--- and all the\n> other engineers and technicians on the project--- have ignored the\n> fact that cymeks had human minds, not AI gelcircuitry? It was a\n> significant, devastating lapse.\n\nStill, the outpouring of faith and hope--- not to mention substantial\nfunding\n\n> --- made him feel a crippling pressure. The people would never allow\n> him to retire now. He must find some other solution, save the day once\n> more.\n>\n> While back in the blufftop laboratories at his Starda residence, he\n> searched constantly, reading dissertations and theoretical papers\n> transmitted to him, combing them for exploitable possibilities. Many\n> of the reports were\n>\n> esoteric, beyond even his comprehension, but occasionally an idea\n> struck his fancy.\n>\n> Holtzman had brought along numerous recordings for this mental sojourn\n> over the Poritrin plains. One ambitious and intriguing paper had been\n> written by an unknown theorist from Rossak named Norma Cenva. She had\n> no credentials, as far as he could determine, but her concepts were\n> nothing short of amazing. She thought of simple things in a completely\n> different light. He had a gut feeling about her, an instinct. And she\n> had such a low profile. . . .\n>\n> As starlight fell over the vast bowl of Poritrin sky, he sat alone in\n> his cabin drinking a warm fruity beverage. He stared at Norma's\n> calculations, working them repeatedly in his mind, watchful for errors\n> while trying to understand. This young, unknown mathematician seemed\n> to harbor no pretensions, as if she simply pulled new ideas out of the\n> clouds and wanted to share them with a man she considered her\n> intellectual comrade. Stymied by some of her derivations, he realized\n> that his doubts were more about his own lack of ability than about her\n> postulations. Norma Cenva seemed divinely inspired.\n>\n> Exactly what he needed.\n>\n> Restless, Holtzman thought long and hard into the night. Finally, with\n> the arrival of dawn, he relaxed and drifted off to sleep, his decision\n> made. The airborne barge rocked in gentle breezes and continued to\n> float across the flat landscape. He dozed off with a smile on his\n> face.\n>\n> Soon he would meet Norma for himself. Perhaps some of her concepts\n> might be applicable to devices he wanted to employ against the\n> thinking machines.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THAT AFTERNOON THE Savant wrote a personal invitation to Norma Cenva\n> and dispatched it to Rossak by League courier. This young woman\n>\n> who had grown up isolated in the jungles just might prove to be his\n> salvation . . . if he handled the situation properly.\n>\n> *Opportunities are a tricky crop, with tiny flowers that are difficult\n> to see and even more difficult to harvest.*\n>\n> --- ANONYMOUS\n>\n> **F**eeling like an intruder, Norma Cenva stood in her mother's study,\n> overlooking the canopied purple trees. A sour, misty rain fell\n> outside; some of the droplets from the high skies contained impurities\n> and poisonous chemicals from spewing volcanic fumes in the distance.\n> On the far horizon, she monitored dark clouds as they drew closer.\n> Soon there would be a downpour.\n>\n> What did Aurelius Venport want her to find in here?\n>\n> Her stern mother maintained an austere room with chalky-white interior\n> walls. An alcove contained the Sorceress's fine clothes, articles that\n> were much too large and fanciful for Norma to wear. Zufa Cenva had an\n> intimidating beauty, a luminous purity that made her as perfect--- and\n> as hard--- as a classic sculpture. Even without telepathic powers, she\n> could draw men like ants to honey.\n>\n> But the chief Sorceress had only a superficial loveliness, concealing\n> an implacability about subjects she never permitted Norma to see. It\n> wasn't that Zufa didn't trust her daughter; she simply considered the\n> girl beneath grand concerns. Like her telepathic companions, Zufa\n> seemed to thrive on secrecy.\n>\n> But Aurelius had seen something here. \"You won't be sorry if you find\n> it, Norma,\" he had told her, smiling. \"I trust your mother to tell you\n> about it eventually . . . but I don't believe it is high in her\n> priorities.\"\n>\n> *I have never been high in her priorities.* Curious, but wary of being\n> caught, Norma continued to investigate.\n>\n> Her gaze settled on a fibersheet notebook resting on a worktable. The\n> thick book had a maroon cover with indecipherable lettering as arcane\n> as the\n>\n> mathematical notations Norma had developed. Once, eavesdropping on the\n> Sorceresses and their intricate plans, Norma heard them refer to their\n> private language as \"Azhar.\"\n>\n> Since returning from Salusa Secundus, her mother had been even more\n> detached and aloof than usual. She seemed driven to attempt greater\n> things, because of the cymek attack. When Norma inquired about the war\n> effort, Zufa had merely frowned at her. \"We will take care of it.\"\n>\n> The chief Sorceress spent much of her time sequestered with a\n> cabalistic clique of women, whispering secret things. Zufa had a fresh\n> passion, a new idea to use against the thinking machines. If her\n> mother had dreamed of any way Norma could contribute, she would have\n> pressed the dwarf girl into service. Instead, Zufa had entirely\n> written off her daughter without giving her a chance.\n>\n> The most talented women, numbering around three hundred, had\n> established a security zone in the deep fungoid jungle, cutting off\n> the pharmaceutical scavengers hired by Aurelius Venport. Any explorer\n> who ventured into the secluded area encountered strange shimmering\n> barricades.\n>\n> Ever alert, Norma had noticed unexplained explosions and fires out\n> where Zufa's hand-picked Sorceresses spent weeks of intensive\n> training. Her mother rarely came back to her cliffside chambers. . . .\n>\n> Now, in her mother's room, Norma discovered two pieces of fine white\n> paper beneath the maroon notebook: the bleached parchment often used\n> by League couriers. This must be what Aurelius had wanted her to find.\n>\n> Dragging a stepstool to the table, she climbed up. She could see the\n> heading on the top sheet of parchment--- a formal document from\n> Poritrin. Curious, afraid her mother might return from the jungles,\n> she removed the pages and was astonished to read in black chancery\n> lettering, SAVANT TIO HOLTZMAN.\n>\n> For what possible purpose had the great inventor written a letter to\n> her mother? Leaning down, the girl read the salutation line: \"Dear\n> Norma\n>\n> Cenva.\" With a scowl, she scanned the message, then reread it with\n> mounting delight mixed with anger. *Tio Holtzman wants me to\n> apprentice with him on Poritrin! He thinks I am brilliant? I can't\n> believe it*.\n>\n> Her own mother had attempted to conceal, or at least delay, the\n> transmittal! Zufa had said nothing, possibly unable to believe the\n> Savant would want anything to do with her daughter. Luckily, Aurelius\n> had told her about it.\n>\n> Norma hurried off to the business district of the cliffside\n> settlement. She found Venport in a tea shop, concluding a meeting with\n> a seedy-looking trader. As the dark-skinned man rose from his seat,\n> Norma hurried over with her off-kilter gait and slid into his place at\n> the table.\n>\n> Venport smiled warmly at her. \"You look excited, Norma. You must have\n> found the letter from Savant Holtzman?\"\n>\n> She thrust the parchment forward. \"My mother tried to prevent me from\n> seeing his offer!\"\n>\n> \"Zufa is a maddening woman, I know, but you must try to understand\n> her. Since neither of us can do the things she values most, Zufa\n> disregards our abilities. Oh, she's aware of your mathematical\n> talents, Norma, and she knows I'm a competent businessman, but our\n> skills do not count for anything with her.\"\n>\n> Norma squirmed on the seat, not wanting to give her mother the benefit\n> of the doubt. \"Then why did she hide this letter?\"\n>\n> Venport laughed. \"She was probably embarrassed by the attention you\n> received.\" He squeezed her hand. \"Don't worry, I will intervene if\n> your mother attempts to block this. In fact, since she's so\n> preoccupied with the other Sorceresses, I can't see how she would\n> object if I were to complete the necessary paperwork for you.\"\n>\n> \"You would do that? Doesn't my mother---\"\n>\n> \"Let me take care of everything. I'll handle her.\" He gave Norma a\n> quick, warm hug. \"I believe in what you can do.\"\n>\n> Acting in Zufa's stead, Aurelius Venport dispatched a formal letter of\n> response to the famous inventor, agreeing to send Norma away. The\n> young woman would study with him on Poritrin and assist him in his\n> laboratories. For Norma, it was the opportunity of a lifetime.\n>\n> Her mother might not even notice she was gone.\n>\n> *Home can be anywhere, for it is a part of one's self.*\n>\n> --- Zensunni saying\n>\n> **E**ven in the wasteland, with wind whipping around him, Selim's luck\n> continued to hold. Survival itself became a wondrous game out in the\n> desert.\n>\n> Leaving the dead sandworm behind, he'd tried to find a small cave or\n> gully in the rocks where he could crouch from the approaching storm.\n> Desperately thirsty, Selim poked around for any signs of human\n> habitation, though he doubted any other man had ever set foot so far\n> out in the arid wilderness.\n>\n> Certainly no one who had lived.\n>\n> After wandering from planet to planet, the Zensunni had come to\n> Arrakis, where they scattered in widely separated settlements. For\n> several generations, the scavenger people had scraped a meager\n> existence from the desert, but only occasionally did they venture from\n> their protected areas, fearful of giant worms.\n>\n> The wild sandworm had taken Selim far from the spaceport, far from the\n> vital supplies that even the most resourceful Zensunni would require.\n> His prospects for survival seemed bleak indeed.\n>\n> So when he stumbled upon an ancient botanical testing station\n> camouflaged in the rocks, Selim could hardly believe his good fortune.\n> Undoubtedly, it was another sign from Buddallah. A miracle!\n>\n> He stood before the domed enclosure erected by long-forgotten\n> ecologists who had studied Arrakis and found it wanting. Perhaps a few\n> Old Empire scientists had lived here and recorded data during a storm\n> season. The rugged structure consisted of several low outbuildings\n> built into the rocks, half-disguised by time and windblown sand.\n>\n> As the howling tempest peppered him with stinging sand, Selim\n> scrambled around the abandoned station. He saw tilted weather vanes,\n> dented wind collectors and other data-gathering devices that looked\n> long dead. Most important, he found an entry hatch.\n>\n> With sore hands and aching arms from his worm-riding ordeal, Selim\n> pounded against the barrier, searching for a way inside. He scooped\n> powdery debris away, looking for some sort of manual mechanism, since\n> batteries would have long since died. He needed to get into the\n> shelter before the storm wind slammed into him with full intensity.\n>\n> Selim had heard of such places. A few had been found and raided by\n> Zensunni scavengers. These self-reliant stations had been placed on\n> Arrakis during humanity's glory days, before the thinking machines had\n> taken over, before Buddislamic refugees had fled to safety. This\n> automated facility was at least a thousand years old, probably more.\n> But in the desert, where the environment remained unchanged for\n> millennia, time ran at a different pace.\n>\n> Selim finally located the mechanism that controlled the hatch. As he\n> had feared, the power cells were dead, providing only enough of a\n> spark to make the door groan open the barest crack.\n>\n> The wind howled. Blown sand hung like fog on the horizon, obscuring\n> the sun. Dust tingled against his raw ears and face, and Selim knew it\n> would soon become a deadly scouring.\n>\n> Growing more desperate, he wedged his sandworm tooth into the dark\n> opening and used it as a pry bar. The aperture widened a little, but\n> not enough. Cold, stale air gasped out. He used the aching muscles in\n> his arms, dug his feet against the rocks to throw his body weight into\n> the effort, and pushed hard on the makeshift lever.\n>\n> With a last groan of resistance, the hatch grated partway open. Selim\n> laughed and tossed the curved worm fang into the interior, where it\n> made a tinkling clatter on the metal floor. He squirmed through into\n> the station, heard the muffled roar of the sandstorm increasing\n> outside. It was on top of him.\n>\n> Impeded by wind and blown sand, Selim grasped the lip of the hatch and\n> pushed hard. Incoming sand fell through a grating in the floor, into a\n> receptacle below. He needed to hurry. The wind let up for only a\n> second, but that was enough. He got the door shut, sealing himself in,\n> away from the violent weather.\n>\n> Safe . . . unbelievably safe. He laughed at his good fortune, then\n> gave a prayer of thanks, more sincere than any he had uttered in his\n> life. How could he question such blessings?\n>\n> Selim used the shaft of wan daylight to look around. Luckily, the\n> abandoned station had plaz windows. Though scratched and pitted from\n> prolonged exposure, they allowed fading illumination inside.\n>\n> The place was like a cave of treasure. Guided by the dust-filtered\n> light from the windows, he found a few old glowstrips which he coaxed\n> into brightening the small shelter. Then he ransacked cupboards and\n> storage vaults. Much of what remained was useless: unreadable\n> data-plaques, dead computerized recording systems, strange instruments\n> that bore the names of archaic corporations. He did, however, find\n> capsules of well-preserved food that had not deteriorated even in all\n> the time this facility had been abandoned.\n>\n> He broke open a capsule and ate the contents. Though the flavors were\n> unusual, the food tasted wonderful, and he felt energy seeping back\n> into his weary flesh. Other containers held concentrated juices, which\n> were like ambrosia to him. Most valuable of all, he found distilled\n> water, hundreds of literjons of it. Undoubtedly it had been collected\n> over the centuries by automated moisture extractors left behind by the\n> long-ago scientific expedition.\n>\n> This was personal wealth beyond anything Selim had imagined possible.\n> He could pay back the brackish water he'd been accused of taking from\n> the tribe a thousand times over. He could return to the Zensunni as a\n> hero. Naib Dhartha would have to forgive him. But Selim had never\n> committed the crime in the first place.\n>\n> While Selim sat comfortable and satisfied, he vowed never to give\n> Dhartha the satisfaction of seeing him return. Ebrahim had betrayed\n> his friendship, and the corrupt Naib had falsely condemned him. His\n> own people had exiled him, never expecting him to survive. Now that he\n> had found a way to live by himself, why would Selim ever want to go\n> back and surrender it all?\n>\n> For two straight nights, the young man slept. At dawn on the second\n> day he awoke and opened more of the sealed boxes and cabinets. He\n> discovered tools, rope, durable fabric, construction material. The\n> possibilities filled him with joy, and Selim found himself chuckling\n> all alone inside the botanical testing station.\n>\n> *I'm alive!*\n>\n> The storm had rattled past as he slept, unsuccessfully scratching\n> against the walls of the shelter like a monster trying to get in. Most\n> of the sand had been deflected, so very little was piled around the\n> enclosure. From the vantage of the station's largest window, Selim\n> gazed across the desert sea that he had crossed on the back of the\n> sandworm. The dunes were fresh and spotless. All signs of the dead\n> worm had been erased, scoured clean. Only this solitary young man\n> remained.\n>\n> He envisioned a long journey ahead of him, and thought he must have a\n> particular calling. Why else would Buddallah have gone to so much\n> trouble to allow poor Selim to live?\n>\n> *What do you want me to do?*\n>\n> Smiling, the outcast looked out upon the desert, wondering how he\n> could possibly cross such an expanse again. The vista filled him with\n> a sensation of supreme solitude. He made out a few rocks in the\n> distance, etched by eternal winds. Here and there were a few hardy\n> plants. Small animals scurried into burrows. Dune merged into dune,\n> desert into desert.\n>\n> Enthralled by his own memories and feeling recklessly invulnerable,\n> Selim decided what he must do, sooner or later. The first time had\n> been an incredible fluke, but he understood better how to do it now.\n>\n> He must ride a sandworm again. And the next time it would not be an\n> accident.\n>\n> *One of the questions the Butlerian Jihad answered with violence was\n> whether the human body is simply a machine that a* man-made *machine\n> can duplicate.

RAJID SUK,\n\n*Post-Trauma Analysis of the Human Species*\n\n> **W**earing a new warrior-form designed to strike terror into the\n> humans on Giedi Prime, Agamemnon strode on armored legs through the\n> broken industries and flaming ruins of the city. The *hrethgir* hadn't\n> stood a chance.\n>\n> Giedi Prime had been conquered easily.\n>\n> The invading machine troops plodded forward, targeting habitation\n> complexes and setting them aflame, blasting parks into blackened\n> fields. In accordance with Agamemnon's orders--- citing the glory of\n> Omnius--- the neo-cymeks and robotic warriors left the Giedi City\n> industries essentially intact.\n>\n> Agamemnon had sworn that Giedi Prime would make up for the cymeks'\n> humiliation on Salusa. Even now, watcheyes flew overhead, recording\n> the carnage, seeing how efficiently the two Titans guided the military\n> operation.\n>\n> Accompanied by his comrade Barbarossa, Agamemnon scanned the\n> topography of the metropolis and located the Magnus's magnificent\n> residence. It was an appropriate place to establish the new center of\n> Synchronized government, a symbolic gesture of domination as well as\n> an affront to the defeated populace.\n>\n> The cymek general's warrior-form was the most monstrous multilegged\n> system he had ever conceived. Electrical discharges fired through\n> artificial muscles, pulling fiber cables taut and moving\n> weapon-studded limbs. He flexed his flowmetal claws and crushed\n> construction blocks in his grip,\n>\n> imagining them to be the skulls of enemies. Following in his own\n> ferocious configuration, Barbarossa laughed at the showmanship.\n>\n> Marching forward on many limbs, the cymeks thundered through the\n> wreckage-strewn streets. Nothing stood in the way of these former\n> warlords. The situation reminded both of them of a thousand years\n> before, when twenty Titans had conquered the Old Empire by trampling\n> the bodies of their foes.\n>\n> This was the way it should be. It only whetted their appetite for\n> more.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> PRIOR TO THE attack, Agamemnon had studied Giedi Prime's defenses,\n> analyzing images taken by spy watcheyes that zoomed through the system\n> like tiny meteoroids. From those readings, the cymek general had\n> concocted a brilliant tactical move, exploiting a slight weakness in\n> planetary defenses.

The plan\n> relied on brute force and overwhelming numbers, not finesse.\n> Nevertheless, it would be effective.\n>\n> With its engines at full speed, the sacrificial vessel had accelerated\n> white-hot into Giedi Prime's atmosphere, faster than any ground-based\n> human missile defenses could target and respond. The other cruisers\n> approached the invisible scrambler shield. Already, gray-white\n> blossoms of smoke and explosions marked where the ground-launched\n> missiles had found targets. The numbers dwindled, as did the distance.\n> The humans could never stop all the invaders.\n>\n> The doomed robot ship sent final images back to the watcheyes so\n> Omnius would have a complete record of the conquest of Giedi Prime.\n> Every nanosecond--- until it passed through the scrambler net, which\n> effectively erased the AI guidance brain. The transmissions became\n> static, then an empty carrier wave.\n>\n> Still, the juggernaut had continued to descend. Even with its\n> gelcircuitry brain neutralized, the plummeting cruiser fell like an\n> asteroidsized hammer.\n>\n> Kindjal fighter craft directly engaged the last explosive-laden\n> vessel, but the inbound ship was too big and too hot to be swerved.\n> The defenders' shots amounted to little more than pellets.\n>\n> The giant dead vessel slammed into the field transmitters on the\n> outskirts of Giedi City. A crater half a kilometer wide flashed into\n> steam; the transmitters, the overwhelmed defenses, and the surrounding\n> inhabited areas all vanished.\n>\n> Shockwaves had toppled buildings for kilometers around and shattered\n> windows. Holtzman's scrambler shields were neutralized in the blink of\n> an eye, and the Giedi Home Guard was crippled.\n>\n> After that, the cymeks and robots had come down in full force.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> \"BARBAROSSA, MY FRIEND, shall we make our grand entrance?\" Agamemnon\n> said, arriving at the residence of the Magnus.\n>\n> \"Just like when we followed Tlaloc into the halls of the Old Empire,\"\n> his fellow Titan agreed. \"It has been a long time since I've enjoyed a\n> victory so much.\"\n>\n> They led enthusiastic neo-cymeks easily through the reeling\n> metropolis. The stunned human inhabitants could not even put up a\n> fight. Behind the cymek conquerors marched robotic troops to help\n> secure the territory.\n>\n> Although part of Giedi Prime's population might flee underground and\n> hide, the citizenry would break, given time. It might take years to\n> root out the last cells of feral resistance. No doubt the conquering\n> machines would endure decades of guerrilla strikes by misguided\n> vigilantes, survivors of the Giedi Home Guard who thought a few\n> gnat-bites would make the invaders pack up and go away. Resistance\n> groups would be a futile exercise, but he had no doubt the locals\n> would try some such foolishness.\n>\n> Agamemnon wondered if he should bring in Ajax to complete the cleanup.\n> The brutal cymek warlord particularly enjoyed hunting humans, as he\n> had proved so effectively during the Hrethgir Rebellions on Walgis. As\n> soon as they installed a copy of the evermind in the ashes of Giedi\n> City, Agamemnon would make appropriate recommendations to the new\n> incarnation of Omnius.\n>\n> Agamemnon and Barbarossa smashed open the front of the governor's\n> residence, clearing an area wide enough for their reinforced bodies.\n> In their wake, soldier robots, much smaller than the cymeks'\n> warrior-forms, flooded\n>\n> into the building. Within moments, the robots brought blond-haired\n> Magnus Sumi before the two Titans.\n>\n> \"We claim your planet in the name of Omnius,\" Barbarossa declared.\n> \"Giedi Prime is now a Synchronized World. We require your cooperation\n> to consolidate our victory.\"\n>\n> Magnus Sumi, trembling with fear, nevertheless spat on the broken\n> floor where the weight of the cymek warrior-forms had crushed his\n> carefully laid tiles.\n>\n> \"Bow to us,\" Barbarossa said.\n>\n> The Magnus laughed. \"You're mad. I would never---\"\n>\n> Agamemnon swung one of his sleek metal arms sideways. He had not fully\n> tested this new body and was not aware of the magnitude of his\n> strength. He had meant to strike the governor in the face, an\n> instinctive angry slap. Instead, the arm delivered a blow so forceful\n> that it ripped the man's torso in half. The two parts of his body\n> thudded against the far wall in a splatter of gore.\n>\n> \"Oh, well. My demand was a mere formality anyway.\" Agamemnon turned\n> optic threads toward his comrade. \"Begin your work, Barbarossa. These\n> robots will assist.\"\n>\n> The Titan programming genius began dismantling the household systems\n> in the governor's residence and setting up power conduits and\n> machinery. He added linkages and installed a blank, resilient\n> gelsphere mainframe into which he uploaded the newest version of\n> Omnius's mind.\n>\n> The process took several hours, during which the thinking machine\n> invasion force moved through the city, putting out fires and shoring\n> up damaged industrial buildings that Agamemnon considered important\n> for the planet's continued utility.\n>\n> The habitation complexes of the surviving humans, though, were left to\n> burn. The suffering people could fend for themselves. Misery would\n> help them understand the hopelessness of their position.\n>\n> Floating overhead, the annoying watcheyes recorded everything. At\n> least it was a victory this time. Agamemnon revealed no sign of his\n> impatience or displeasure, knowing that resistance against the\n> computer evermind would be fruitless. *For now*. Instead, he must\n> select the proper place and time.\n>\n> Once installed and activated, the new incarnation of Omnius would show\n> no appreciation toward the two seemingly loyal Titans for their\n> victory, nor would the evermind begrudge the loss of his machine\n> juggernaut. It was a military operation well executed, and the\n> Synchronized Worlds had now added one of humanity's jewels to its\n> empire. A psychological and strategic success.\n>\n> When the immense download was finally complete, Agamemnon activated\n> the new copy of the distributed evermind. Systems surged alive, and\n> the omniscient computer began to survey its new domain.\n>\n> \"Welcome, Lord Omnius,\" Agamemnon said to the wallspeakers. \"I present\n> to you the gift of another world.\"\n>\n> *We are happiest when planning our futures, letting our optimism and\n> imagination run unrestrained. Unfortunately, the universe does not\n> always heed such plans.*\n\n--- ABBESS LIVIA BUTLER,\n\nprivate journals\n\n> **A**lthough their marriage was a foregone conclusion, Serena and\n> Xavier happily endured the extravagant betrothal banquet thrown by\n> Viceroy Manion Butler at his hilltop estate.\n>\n> Emil and Lucille Tantor had brought baskets of apples and pears from\n> their orchards and huge jars of herbed olive oil for dipping the\n> fresh-baked engagement rolls. Manion Butler served up exquisite roasts\n> of beef, spice-crusted fowl, and stuffed fishes. Serena provided\n> colorful flowers from her extensive gardens, which she had faithfully\n> tended since she was a child.\n>\n> Famous Salusan performers tied ribbons on shrubs in the courtyard, and\n> presented folk dances there. The women secured their dark hair with\n> jeweled combs and wore white dresses adorned with embroidered\n> patterns. The flowing skirts flew like whirlwinds about their waists,\n> while dapper gentlemen strutted around them like peacocks in a mating\n> challenge. Brassy music offset by soulful balisets drifted through the\n> afternoon.\n>\n> Xavier and Serena wore impressive outfits befitting a proud military\n> officer and the talented daughter of the League Viceroy. They strolled\n> among the assembled guests, careful to address each family\n> representative by name. The couple sampled prized wines from dusty\n> bottles brought in by the scions of every household. Xavier, who could\n> taste none of the subtleties in the vintages, took care not to get too\n> drunk; he was already giddy at the prospect of his upcoming marriage.\n>\n> Serena's sister Octa, two years younger, seemed equally excited. With\n> her long chestnut hair adorned by fresh cornflowers, Octa's eyes were\n> wide\n>\n> with amazement, enchanted by her sister's beau and fantasizing about a\n> handsome young officer who might be her own husband one day.\n>\n> Amazingly, Serena's reclusive mother Livia came to spend the\n> celebratory weekend at the Butler manor. Manion's wife rarely left the\n> City of Introspection, a retreat where she kept herself from the cares\n> and nightmares of the world. The enlightened philosophical preserve,\n> owned by a Butler trust, had originally been established to study and\n> ponder the Zen Hekiganshu of III Delta Pavonis, the Tawrah and\n> Talmudic Zabur, even the Obeah Ritual. But under Butler patronage, the\n> City had gradually blossomed into something the likes of which had not\n> been seen for millennia.\n>\n> Xavier had not seen Serena's mother often, especially in recent years.\n> With her tanned skin and lean features, Livia Butler was a handsome\n> beauty. She rejoiced in the betrothal of her daughter and seemed to\n> enjoy herself as she danced with her jovial husband or sat beside him\n> at the banquet table. She looked not at all like a woman who had fled\n> from the world.\n>\n> Years ago, Livia and Manion's strong marriage had been envied by many\n> noble families. Serena was their eldest child, but they also had twins\n> two years younger: the calm and shy Octa and a sensitive, intelligent\n> boy, Fredo. While Serena underwent political schooling, the twins were\n> raised as close companions, though neither had the far-ranging\n> aspirations of their older sister.\n>\n> Fredo had been fascinated by musical instruments and folk songs,\n> traditions from the grandest planets of the former Empire. He learned\n> to be a musician and poet, while Octa was intrigued with painting and\n> sculpture. In Salusan society, artisans and creative people were\n> highly respected, as admirable as any politician.\n>\n> But at the age of fourteen, honey-voiced Fredo died of a wasting\n> disease, his skin splotched with purplish discolorations. For months,\n> he'd grown thinner and thinner, his muscles atrophying. His blood\n> would not clot, and he could not keep even the thinnest of broths in\n> his stomach. The Salusan\n>\n> doctors had never seen anything like it. Frantic, Viceroy Butler\n> begged the League for help.\n>\n> The men of Rossak offered a number of experimental drugs from their\n> fungoid jungles to treat Fredo's undiagnosed malady. Livia insisted on\n> trying everything. Unfortunately, the young man reacted poorly to the\n> third Rossak drug, an allergic response that caused his throat to\n> swell. Fredo went into convulsions and stopped breathing.\n>\n> Octa had mourned the loss of her brother and came to fear for her own\n> life as well. Fredo's disease was eventually determined to be\n> genetically based, meaning that she and her older sister were at risk\n> of contracting the fatal malady themselves. Octa took care with her\n> health and lived each day dreading that her life would come to a slow,\n> painful end like that of her brother.\n>\n> Fiercely confident and optimistic, Serena always tried to console her\n> sister, giving her a shoulder to cry on, offering encouragement.\n> Though neither sister had shown signs of the strange disease, Octa's\n> dreams had lost all momentum, and she gave up her artwork, becoming a\n> quieter, more pensive soul. She was a frail teenager now, hoping for a\n> spark of wonder to bring her back to the fullness of life.\n>\n> Though her husband had a brilliant political career and his importance\n> grew with each season, formerly vivacious Livia had withdrawn from\n> public life to her spiritual retreat, where she focused on\n> philosophical and religious pursuits. She donated large sums to the\n> imposing fortress to build additional meditation chambers, temples,\n> and libraries. After devoting many sleepless nights to frank\n> discussions with the Cogitor Kwyna, Livia became the Abbess of the\n> facility.\n>\n> In the aftermath of the tragedy, Manion Butler had immersed himself in\n> League work, while Serena felt a heavier burden and set higher goals.\n> Though she could do nothing to help her brother, she wanted to stop\n> the suffering of other people whenever she could. She plunged into\n> politics, working to stop the practice of human slavery still common\n> on some\n>\n> League Worlds, and pledging herself to finding a way to overthrow the\n> thinking machines. No one had ever accused her of lacking in vision or\n> energy. . . .\n>\n> Living separate lives now, Manion and Livia Butler remained pillars of\n> Salusan society, proud of each other's accomplishments--- not\n> divorced, not even emotionally separated . . . just following\n> different paths. Xavier knew that Serena's mother occasionally came\n> back to spend nights with her husband and enjoy weekends with her\n> daughters. But she always returned to the City of Introspection.\n>\n> Serena's betrothal had been important enough to bring her mother into\n> the public eye again. After Xavier danced with his future bride four\n> times in a row, Abbess Livia insisted on having a dance with her\n> future son-in-law.\n>\n> Later, during a long acoustic set of the Long March Ballads played by\n> native Salusan minstrels, Xavier and Serena slipped into the manor\n> house, leaving Livia to weep unabashedly as she watched the musicians\n> and remembered how Fredo had wanted to become a player himself. Manion\n> sat beside his wife, rocking her gently.\n>\n> At the event in their honor, Xavier and Serena had by now experienced\n> their fill of company and revelry, of greeting guests and sampling\n> food and wine. They laughed at every witticism, whether subtle or\n> crude, so as not to offend the grand families. By now, the two were\n> desperate for just a few moments alone.\n>\n> Finally they slipped away and hurried through the corridors of the\n> manor house, past hot kitchens and musty storerooms, to a small alcove\n> outside the Winter Sun room. In winter, slanted sunshine lit this room\n> with bronze rainbows. The Butler family traditionally took their\n> breakfasts here during the cold season, enjoying family conversation\n> while they watched the rising sun. It was a place of fond memories for\n> Serena.\n>\n> She crowded with Xavier into the alcove just outside the room;\n> glow-panels shone in the hall, but still allowed a few rich shadows.\n> Serena pulled him close and kissed him. He placed a hand behind her\n> neck and stroked her\n>\n> hair as he pulled her face close to his and kissed more deeply, hungry\n> for her.\n>\n> When they heard hurried footsteps in the hall, the lovers hid in\n> silence, quietly chuckling at their secret rendezvous. But fresh-faced\n> Octa easily found them. Flushed with embarrassment, Octa averted her\n> gaze. \"You must come back to the banquet hall. Father is ready to\n> serve dessert. And an offworld messenger is coming.\"\n>\n> \"A messenger?\" Xavier suddenly sounded military and formal. \"From\n> whom?\"\n>\n> \"He went to Zimia demanding an audience with the League Parliament,\n> but since most of the nobles are here for the banquet, he's on his way\n> up the hill.\"\n>\n> Bending his elbows outward, Xavier offered an arm to each sister. \"Let\n> us go together so we can hear what this messenger has to say.\" Forcing\n> a lighthearted tone, he said, \"After all, I haven't eaten enough\n> today. I could use a bowl of roast custard and a whole plateful of\n> candied eggs.\"\n>\n> Octa giggled, but Serena gave him a mock stern frown. \"I suppose I\n> must resign myself to life with a fat husband.\"\n>\n> They entered the large hall, where the guests gathered around a long\n> table, complimenting the array of extraordinarily beautiful desserts\n> that looked too precious to be eaten. Manion and Livia Butler stood\n> side by side, raising a toast to the couple.\n>\n> Sipping politely from his wine, Xavier detected an undercurrent of\n> worry in the Viceroy's manner. Everyone pretended to be unconcerned\n> about what news the messenger might bring, but the moment a pounding\n> sounded on the door, all activity stopped. Manion Butler himself\n> opened the wooden portal, gesturing for the man to enter.\n>\n> He wasn't a formal courier. His eyes were haunted and his officer's\n> uniform unkempt, as if he no longer cared about protocol or\n> appearances. Xavier\n>\n> recognized the insignia of the Giedi Prime Home Guard. Like other\n> League uniforms, it bore the gold sigil of free humanity on the lapel.\n>\n> \"I have grave news, Viceroy Butler. The fastest ships have brought me\n> directly here.\"\n>\n> \"What is it, young man?\" Manion's voice was filled with dread.\n>\n> \"Giedi Prime has fallen to the thinking machines!\" The officer raised\n> his voice against the guests' disbelieving outcries. \"The robots and\n> cymeks found a flaw in our defenses and destroyed our scrambler-field\n> transmitters. Much of our population has been slaughtered and the\n> survivors enslaved. A new Omnius evermind has already been activated.\"\n>\n> The people in the hall wailed at hearing of the devastating defeat.\n> Xavier clutched Serena's hand so tightly he feared he might hurt her.\n> Inside, he had turned to stone, his stomach filled with a cold\n> heaviness.\n>\n> He had just been to Giedi Prime, had inspected the defenses himself.\n> Xavier had been terribly anxious to finish his inspection tour so that\n> he could return to Serena. Could he possibly have missed something? He\n> squeezed his eyes shut as the questions and disbelieving comments\n> turned to a buzz around him. Was he to blame? Had a simple mistake, a\n> bit of impatience from a young man in love, caused an entire planet to\n> fall?\n>\n> Manion Butler placed both palms on the table to steady himself. Livia\n> reached over to touch her husband's shoulder, adding silent support.\n> She closed her eyes, and her lips moved as if in prayer.\n>\n> The Viceroy spoke. \"Another free planet lost to the Synchronized\n> Worlds, and one of our strongholds, too.\" He straightened, took a\n> shuddering breath. \"We must call an immediate war council, summon all\n> representatives.\" With a meaningful glance at Serena, he added, \"Let\n> us also include anyone who speaks for the Unallied Planets and wishes\n> to join us in this fight.\"\n>\n> *Everything in the universe contains flaws, ourselves included.

Inside her private chamber, Zufa Cenva lay\n> sweat-streaked on a pallet. She shrieked in pain, clenching her teeth,\n> her eyes glassy.\n>\n> Alone. No one dared come near a delirious Sorceress of Rossak.\n>\n> A metallic doorway curtain rattled with an invisible tele-kinetic\n> force. Wall shelves buckled in the aftershocks of Zufa's psychic\n> explosions, scattering pots and keepsakes all over the floor.\n>\n> Her long white hair was wild, quivering with internal energy. Her pale\n> hands gripped the sides of the pallet like scraping claws. If any\n> woman had come close enough to try to soothe her, Zufa would have\n> scratched her face and mentally hurled her against the whitewashed\n> walls.\n>\n> She screamed again. The chief Sorceress had endured several\n> miscarriages before, but never one so agonizing or disruptive. She\n> cursed worthless Aurelius Venport.\n>\n> Zufa's spine shuddered, as if someone had jolted her with electricity.\n> Delicate ornamental objects floated into the air on invisible strings,\n> then flew in every direction, smashing into shards. One hollowed-out\n> irongourd stuffed with dried flowers burst into white flames,\n> crackling and smoking.\n>\n> She gasped as her body cramped, squeezing her abdominal muscles. It\n> seemed as if this unborn child wanted to kill her, to drag her down to\n> death before she could expel it from her uterus.\n>\n> Another failure! And she so desperately wanted to produce a true\n> daughter, a successor to lead her fellow Sorceresses to new heights of\n> mental power. The genetic index had misled her again. Damn Venport and\n> his failings! She should have abandoned him long ago.\n>\n> Out of her head with pain and despair, Zufa wanted to kill the man who\n> had planted the child-seed inside her, even though the pregnancy had\n> been at her own insistence. She had completed the bloodline\n> calculations so carefully, had gone over the genes again and again.\n> Breeding with Venport should have produced only superior offspring.\n>\n> Nothing like this.\n>\n> Telepathic blasts echoed into the corridors, sending Rossak women\n> scurrying in terror. Then she saw Aurelius Venport himself standing at\n> the doorway, haggard with worry. His eyes were filled with concern.\n>\n> But Zufa knew he was a liar.\n>\n> Unafraid for his own safety, Venport entered their bedchamber,\n> displaying patience, concern, and tolerance.

In a petulant\n> attempt to slight him, she smashed a set of tiny hollownut sculptures\n> he had given her during their courtship and genetic testing.\n>\n> Still, he stepped forward, as if immune to her ferine outbursts. In\n> the hall behind him, muted voices urged caution, but he ignored them.\n> He came to her pallet, smiling with compassion and understanding.\n>\n> Venport knelt beside the bed, stroking her sweaty hand. He whispered\n> soothing nonsense in her ears. She couldn't understand his words, but\n> she grasped his fingers until she expected to feel the bones snap.

If the great Zufa Cenva was no longer there to protect\n> him, who would keep this man as a pet? Who would care for him? She\n> doubted he could take care of himself.\n>\n> Then, with greater fear:*Or could he?*\n>\n> Venport had sent Norma off on a long journey to Poritrin, arranging\n> everything behind Zufa's back, as if he believed that a man like Tio\n> Holtzman truly wanted to work with her daughter. What was he planning?\n> She gritted her teeth, wanting to prove that she understood his\n> intentions. Her threats came as sharp gasps. \"You can't . . . let me\n> die, bastard! No one . . . else would . . . have you!\"\n>\n> Instead, he looked at her, coolly patronizing. \"You've told me many\n> times that I come from a good genetic line, my darling. But I do not\n> desire someone else among the Sorceresses. I prefer to stay with you.\"\n> He lowered his voice, looking at her with an oddly intense love that\n> she could not quite fathom. \"I understand you better than you do\n> yourself, Zufa Cenva. Always pushing, constantly demanding more than\n> anyone can possibly give. Nobody--- not even you--- can be perfect all\n> the time.\"\n>\n> With a final prolonged shriek, she expelled her deformed, resistant\n> fetus, a monstrously abnormal creature. Seeing the bright blood,\n> Venport bellowed for assistance, and two brave midwives scurried into\n> the chamber. One reached down with a towel, placing it over the fetus\n> like a shroud, while the other bathed Zufa's skin, adding pain-numbing\n> salves distilled from jungle spores. Venport sent for the best drugs\n> from his own stockpiles.\n>\n> Finally, he took the squirming fetus himself, holding the bloody\n> larval thing in his hands. It had dark skin and strange mottled spots\n> that made it look as if proto-eyes had grown all over its limbless\n> body. He saw the thing twitch a final time, then it stopped moving.\n>\n> He wrapped it up in the towel, trying to ignore the tear in his eye.\n> His expression stony, Venport handed the corrupt fetus to one of the\n> midwives,\n>\n> saying nothing. It would be taken out into the jungles, and no one\n> would ever see it again.\n>\n> The exhausted Sorceress lay back, shuddering, just now beginning to\n> feel a sense of reality and despair again. The miscarriage had hurt\n> her, leaving her with a deep sadness that went beyond the goals of any\n> breeding program. Her vision returned to focus, and she noticed the\n> psychokinetic destruction she had caused in the room. It all spoke of\n> weakness, of lack of control.\n>\n> This was her third horrific miscarriage from mating with Venport. Deep\n> disappointment and anger boiled inside her. \"I chose you for your\n> bloodline, Aurelius,\" she muttered through dry lips. \"What went\n> wrong?\"\n>\n> He looked at her, still expressionless, as if his passion had been\n> washed away. \"Genetics is not an exact science.\"\n>\n> Zufa closed her eyes. \"Failures, always failures.\" She was the\n> greatest Sorceress of Rossak, and yet she had endured so many\n> disappointments. Sighing with disgust, Zufa thought of her stunted\n> daughter, not wanting to believe that the ugly dwarf was the best she\n> could achieve.\n>\n> Venport shook his head, uncharacteristically stern and impatient now\n> that the danger was past. \"You have had successes, Zufa. You just\n> don't know how to recognize them.\"\n>\n> She forced herself to rest, to recuperate.

Her diminutive form drew\n> glances, but was not so unusual that people turned pitying stares upon\n> her. On the Unallied Planets there was a variety of races, some with\n> stunted statures. She didn't care about the opinions of others anyway.\n> She only wanted to impress Tio Holtzman.\n>\n> Before Norma's departure from Rossak, her aloof mother had looked down\n> at her with dismissive puzzlement. Zufa chose to believe that the\n> brilliant Savant had made a mistake or had misread one of Norma's\n> theoretical papers. She expected her daughter to return home before\n> long.\n>\n> Aurelius Venport had made all of the arrangements, used his own\n> profits to pay for a nicer cabin than Holtzman had offered. While her\n> mother continued to work with the Sorceress trainees, Venport had\n> accompanied Norma to the docking-transfer stations in Rossak orbit. He\n> had given her a gift of delicately petrified flowers and a chaste hug\n> before she'd climbed aboard the vessel. With a wry smile, he told her,\n> \"All of us disappointments need to stick together.\"\n>\n> Norma held onto that warm but troubling comment during the long\n> journey to Poritrin. . . .\n>\n> When the shuttle landed in the river-delta city of Starda, Norma\n> carefully inserted Venport's petrified flowers into her mousy brown\n> hair, a sprig of beauty that contrasted with the plainness of her wide\n> face, large head, and rounded nose. She wore a loose blouse and\n> comfortable hose, both woven from fernfibers.\n>\n> Jostled by other passengers crowded at the shuttle hatch, the girl\n> carried only a small travel pack. Climbing down the ramp, Norma felt\n> flushed and eager to meet the scientist she admired, a thinker who\n> took her seriously. She had heard many stories of Savant Holtzman's\n> mathematical prowess, and she would be hard pressed to contribute\n> anything the great man hadn't already developed. She hoped she would\n> not let him down.\n>\n> Scanning the waiting crowd, she immediately recognized the eminent\n> scientist. A clean-shaven man with shoulder-length gray hair, Holtzman\n> appeared to be in his late middle years. His hands and fingernails\n> were clean, his clothing impeccable and ornamented with stylish\n> designs and badges.\n>\n> He greeted her with a broad smile and open arms that let the sleeves\n> of his white robe droop. \"Welcome to Poritrin, Miss Cenva.\" Holtzman\n> placed both hands on her shoulders in formal greeting. If he\n> experienced any disappointment upon seeing Norma's stature and coarse,\n> unattractive features, he did not show it. \"I certainly hope you've\n> brought your imagination with you.\" He gestured toward a doorway. \"We\n> have a lot of work to do together.\"\n>\n> He steered her through the spaceport crowds, away from their curious\n> stares, then took her away from Starda Spaceport in a private\n> limo-barge that floated high above the graceful Isana River.\n>\n> \"Poritrin is a peaceful world, where I can let my mind wander and\n> think of things that might save the human race.\" Holtzman smiled\n> proudly at her. \"I'm expecting that of you, too.\"\n>\n> \"I will do my best, Savant Holtzman.\"\n>\n> \"What more could any person ask?\"\n>\n> The skies of Poritrin held a gauze of clouds painted citrus yellow\n> with afternoon sunlight. The barge drifted above the multifingered\n> streamlets that wrapped around shifting islands and sandbars.\n> Traditional boats rode the current of the broad river, loaded with\n> grains and cargo for distribution\n>\n> in the port city and export offworld. Fertile Poritrin fed many\n> less-fortunate planets, in return for which they received raw\n> materials, equipment, manufactured goods, and human slaves to add to\n> their labor force.\n>\n> Some of the largest buildings in the spaceport were actually boats on\n> pontoons, anchored to the bases of sandstone bluffs. The roofs were\n> composed of layered shingles of silver-blue metal, smelted in mines\n> far to the north.\n>\n> He gestured to a bluff overlooking the crowded portions of blue-roofed\n> Starda, where she could recognize the influences of classic\n> Navachristian architecture. \"My laboratories are up there. Buildings\n> and supply sheds, quarters for my slaves and solvers, as well as my\n> own home--- everything built into that double spire of rock.\"\n>\n> The floating transport circled toward two sections of stone, like\n> adjacent fingers rising above the riverbed. She could see sheetplaz\n> windows, awning-covered balconies, and a walkway that linked a dome on\n> one spire with a conical stone tower and outbuildings on the other.\n>\n> Holtzman was pleased to note the amazement on her face. \"We have\n> quarters for you, Norma, in addition to private lab facilities and a\n> team of assistants to perform calculations based upon your theories. I\n> expect you to keep them all very busy.\"\n>\n> Norma looked at him, puzzled. \"Someone else to do the mathematics?\"\n>\n> \"Of course!\" Holtzman brushed iron-gray hair away from his face and\n> adjusted his white robe. \"You're an *idea* person, like me. We want\n> you to develop concepts, not bother with full-fledged implementation.\n> You should not waste time performing tedious arithmetic. Any\n> halfway-trained person can do that. It's what slaves are for.\"\n>\n> When the floating barge settled onto a glazed-tile deck, servants\n> emerged to take Norma's bags and offer the two of them cool drinks.\n> Like an eager boy, Holtzman led Norma to his impressive laboratories.\n> The large rooms were filled with water clocks and magnetic sculptures\n> in which spheres orbited\n>\n> about electrical paths without wires or gears. Sketches and\n> half-finished drawings covered electrostatic boards, surrounded by\n> serpentine calculations that went nowhere.\n>\n> Glancing around, Norma realized that Holtzman had abandoned more\n> concepts than she had ever created in her life. Even so, many of the\n> cluttered papers and geometric drawings looked a bit old. Some of the\n> ink had faded, and papers were curled around the edges.\n>\n> With a swish of his wide sleeves, Holtzman gave the intriguing items a\n> dismissive wave. \"Just toys, useless gadgets that I keep for my\n> amusement.\" He poked a finger at one of the floating silver balls,\n> which sent the other model planets into dangerous orbits, spinning\n> about like heavenly bodies out of control. \"Sometimes I dabble with\n> them for inspiration, but usually they only make me think of other\n> toys, not the weapons of mass destruction we need in order to save us\n> from the tyranny of machines.\"\n>\n> With a distracted frown, Holtzman continued, \"My work is constrained\n> in that I cannot use sophisticated computers. In order to perform the\n> enormous calculations required to test a theory, I have no recourse\n> but to rely upon human mental abilities and hope for the best from the\n> fallible calculational skills of trained people. Come, let me show you\n> the solvers.\"\n>\n> He led her to a well-illuminated chamber with high windows. Inside,\n> numerous identical benches and flat tabletops had been set up in a\n> grid layout. Workers hunched over each writing surface using handheld\n> calculation devices. From their drab garments and dull expressions,\n> Norma judged that these men and women must be some of Poritrin's\n> numerous slaves.\n>\n> \"This is the only way we can imitate the abilities of a thinking\n> machine,\" Holtzman explained. \"A computer can handle billions of\n> iterations. We have a harder time of it, yet with enough people\n> working in concert and as specialists, we accomplish billions of\n> calculations on our own. It just takes longer.\"\n>\n> He walked down the narrow aisles between the solvers, who were\n> furiously scribing numbers and mathematical symbols on flat slates,\n> checking and double-checking answers before passing them on to the\n> next person in line.\n>\n> \"Even the most complex math can be broken into a sequence of trivial\n> steps. Each of these slaves has been trained to complete specific\n> equations in an assembly-line fashion. When taken together, this\n> collective human mind is capable of remarkable feats.\" Holtzman\n> surveyed the room as if he expected his solvers to give him a\n> resounding cheer. Instead, they studied their work with heavy-lidded\n> eyes, moving through equation after equation with no comprehension of\n> reasons or larger pictures.\n>\n> Norma felt sympathy for them, having been belittled and ignored for so\n> long herself. She knew intellectually that human slavery was a way of\n> life on many League Worlds, as it was throughout the machine-ruled\n> planets. Nevertheless, she supposed that these workers would prefer\n> doing mental work to heavy labor out in the agricultural fields.\n>\n> With a magnanimous gesture, the scientist said, \"Every solver is at\n> your disposal, Norma, whenever you develop a theory that needs\n> verification. The next stage, of course is to build prototypes for\n> further testing and development. We have plenty of labs and test\n> facilities, but the most important work comes first.\" He tapped a\n> fingertip on his own forehead. *\"Up here.\"*\n>\n> Holtzman gave her a cockeyed grin and lowered his voice. \"Mistakes are\n> possible, of course, even at our level. If that happens, we hope that\n> Lord Niko Bludd is tolerant enough to keep us around.\"\n>\n> *Only those with narrow minds fail to see that the definition of\n> Impossible is 'Lack of imagination and incentive.'*\n>\n> --- SERENA BUTLER\n>\n> **I**n the front parlor of the Butler manor house, Xavier Harkonnen\n> shifted on a green brocaded settee. His duty uniform was not designed\n> for lounging in fine furniture. Ornate gold-framed paintings of Butler\n> ancestors adorned the walls, including one like a caricature of a\n> gentleman with a waxed handlebar mustache and a tricorner hat.\n>\n> Between tight duty shifts, he had rushed here to surprise Serena, and\n> the servants had asked him to wait. Blushing, Octa came into the\n> parlor, carrying a cool drink for him. Though he had always seen her\n> as Serena's little sister, Xavier realized with surprise that she was\n> actually a lovely young woman. With Serena's recent betrothal, Octa\n> might be dreaming of her own marriage, if she could ever overcome her\n> shy infatuation with him.\n>\n> \"Serena wasn't expecting you, but she'll be right out.\" Octa looked\n> away. \"She's in a meeting with official-looking men and women,\n> assistants carrying electronic equipment, a few Militia uniforms.\n> Something to do with her Parliament work, I think.\"\n>\n> Xavier gave a wan smile. \"We both have so many projects, but such\n> times demand it.\"\n>\n> While Octa occupied herself straightening books and statuettes on a\n> shelf, Xavier thought back to a Parliament session he had watched two\n> days before. Upset over the tragic fall of Giedi Prime, Serena had\n> tried to rally representatives from the strongest planets, hoping to\n> mount a rescue operation. She always wanted to *do* something; it was\n> one of the reasons Xavier loved her so much. While others accepted the\n> defeat and cringed in fear that Omnius would push for more conquests,\n> Serena wanted to charge in and save the world. Any world.\n>\n> Dressed in a long gown, she had spoken passionately in the temporary\n> Hall of Parliament. \"We can't just give up on Giedi Prime! The\n> thinking machines have penetrated the scrambler shields, killed the\n> Magnus, enslaved the people, and every day their presence grows\n> stronger. There have to be Home Guard survivors fighting behind the\n> machine lines, and we know that another shield-generator station was\n> nearly completed. Perhaps that can be made functional! We must fight\n> back before the thinking machines can establish their own\n> infrastructure. If we wait, they will become unassailable!\"\n>\n> \"As far as we know, they are already unassailable,\" grumbled the\n> representative from industrial Vertree Colony.\n>\n> The Zanbar official added, \"Bringing the Armada to Giedi Prime would\n> be suicide. Without their scrambler shields, they have no defenses\n> left, and the machines would slaughter us in a direct conflict.\"\n>\n> Serena had jabbed a finger at the nervous audience. \"Not necessarily.\n> If we could slip in and finish the work at the secondary\n> shield-generating complex, then project a new blanket of disruptor\n> fields, we could cut off---\"\n>\n> The League members had actually laughed at the suggestion. Seeing her\n> heartbroken expression, Xavier felt stung on Serena's behalf. But she\n> had not understood the difficulty of her na\u00efve suggestion, the\n> impossibility of restoring Giedi Prime's shields under the noses of\n> the machine conquerors. During his planetary inspection tour, Xavier\n> had learned that it could take days or weeks for engineers--- working\n> under the best of conditions--- to make the backup shield system\n> operational.\n>\n> But Serena never stopped trying. The ache of imagining so many\n> suffering humans drove her to it.\n>\n> The vote had gone overwhelmingly against her. \"We cannot spend the\n> resources, firepower, or personnel on an ill-advised mission to a\n> planet we have already lost. It is now a machine stronghold.\" The\n> nobles feared for their own local defenses.\n>\n> Such work occupied most of Xavier's time. As an Armada officer, he had\n> gone to extended sessions with officers and Parliament\n> representatives, including Viceroy Butler. Xavier was determined to\n> learn what had gone wrong with Giedi Prime's defenses--- and whether\n> he was to blame in some way.\n>\n> Armada tacticians had studied the inspection records and assured him\n> that he could have done nothing to prevent the takeover, short of\n> stationing a full fleet of battleships at every League World. If\n> Omnius was willing to sacrifice part of his robotic attack force to\n> bring down Holtzman's scrambler shields, no planet was safe. But the\n> information didn't make Xavier feel much better.\n>\n> On Poritrin, Tio Holtzman was working hard to improve the scrambler\n> system design. Lord Bludd expressed his optimism and confidence in the\n> Savant, especially since the inventor had brought in another\n> mathematician, the daughter of the Sorceress Zufa Cenva, to assist\n> him. Xavier hoped something could be done quickly enough to make a\n> difference. . . .\n>\n> Lovely but harried, Serena entered the parlor and hugged him. \"I had\n> no idea you were coming.\" Octa slipped out the side door.\n>\n> Xavier looked at the ornate clock on the mantel. \"I wanted to surprise\n> you, but I have to get back to duty. I have a long meeting this\n> afternoon.\"\n>\n> She nodded, preoccupied. \"Since the attack on Giedi Prime, we've all\n> been prisoners of our planning sessions. I think I've lost track of\n> how many committees I serve.\"\n>\n> Teasingly, he said, \"Should I have been invited to this mysterious\n> gathering?\"\n>\n> Her chuckle sounded forced. \"Oh? The League Armada doesn't give you\n> enough work, so you'd like to sit in on my tedious meetings as well?\n> Perhaps I should speak to your new commander.\"\n>\n> \"No thank you, my dear. I'd rather fight ten cymeks than try to\n> dissuade you when you've set your mind to something.\" Serena responded\n> to his kiss with surprising passion. He stepped back, breathing hard,\n> and straightened his uniform. \"I need to go.\"\n>\n> \"Can I make it up to you at dinner tonight? A little t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, just\n> the two of us?\" Her eyes sparkled. \"It's important to me, especially\n> now.\"\n>\n> \"I'll be there.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WITH A SIGH of relief after quelling Xavier's suspicions, Serena\n> returned to the Winter Sun Room where her team had gathered. She wiped\n> a sparkle of sweat from her forehead. Several faces turned toward her,\n> and she raised a hand to allay concerns.\n>\n> Late morning sunlight splashed across the chairs, the tile counters\n> and a breakfast table now strewn with plans, maps, and resource\n> charts. \"We've got to get back to work,\" said the grizzled veteran Ort\n> Wibsen. \"Don't have much time if you want to put this in motion.\"\n>\n> \"That is absolutely my intention, Commander Wibsen. Anybody with\n> doubts should have left us days ago.\"\n>\n> Serena's father believed that she spent her mornings in the bright,\n> cheery room just reading, but for weeks she had been exploring schemes\n> . . .\n>\n> gathering volunteers, expert personnel, and raw materials. No one\n> could stop Serena Butler from devoting her energies to humanitarian\n> work.\n>\n> \"I tried to follow proper channels and make the League take action,\"\n> she said, \"but sometimes people must be coerced into making the right\n> decision. They must be led to it, like a stubborn Salusan stallion.\"\n>\n> After the Parliament laughed at her \"na\u00efve foolishness,\" Serena had\n> marched out of the temporary meeting hall but did not accept defeat.\n> She\n>\n> decided to change tactics, even if she had to organize and finance a\n> mission herself.\n>\n> When Xavier learned of her plan, after it was too late to stop her,\n> she hoped he would be proud of her.\n>\n> Now she studied the team she had gathered from the Armada's most\n> overlooked experts in commando operations: captains, supply runners,\n> even infiltration specialists. Ten men and women turned to look at\n> her. She clicked a remote control switch to close the overhead\n> louvers. The brightness of the room diminished, though muted sunlight\n> continued to filter in.\n>\n> \"If we can reclaim Giedi Prime, it will be twice the moral victory\n> that the machines had,\" Serena said. \"We will show that they cannot\n> hold us.\"\n>\n> Wibsen looked as if he had never ceased fighting, though he had been\n> off active duty for over a decade. \"All of us are more than happy to\n> tackle a task that will have tangible results. I've been itching to\n> strike a blow against the damned machines.\"\n>\n> Ort Wibsen was an old space commander who had been forced to retire---\n> ostensibly because of his age. More likely it had to do with his\n> coarse personality, a penchant for arguing with superiors, and history\n> of ignoring the details of orders. In spite of his surliness he was\n> exactly the man Serena needed to lead a mission that other League\n> members would have declared insane, or at least unwise.\n>\n> \"Then this is your chance, Commander,\" she said.\n>\n> Pinquer Jibb, the curly-haired and still-haggard-looking messenger who\n> had fled the conquest of Giedi Prime to deliver his terrible news, sat\n> stiff-backed, looking around the room. \"I've provided you with all the\n> background material you need. I've compiled detailed reports. The\n> subsidiary shield-generator station was nearly finished when the\n> machines attacked the planet. We merely need to slip in and get it\n> running.\" His haunted eyes grew fiery. \"Plenty members of the Giedi\n> Home Guard must\n>\n> have survived. They'll be doing everything they can behind enemy\n> lines, but that won't be enough unless we help them.\"\n>\n> \"If we can get the secondary shield generators functional, the cymeks\n> and robots on the surface will fall to a concerted defense from the\n> Armada.\" She scanned the others in the room. \"Do you think we'll be\n> able to do that?\"\n>\n> Brigit Paterson, a masculine-looking woman, frowned. \"What makes you\n> think the Armada will join the fight? After my engineers get the job\n> done, how will we make sure the military comes in to save our butts?\"\n>\n> Serena gave her a grim smile. \"You leave that to me.\"\n>\n> Serena had been raised with the best schools and tutors, groomed to\n> become a leader. With so much that needed to be done, she could not\n> sit in a comfortable manor house and fail to use the Butler wealth and\n> power.\n>\n> Now she was about to put that determination to the test. \"Commander\n> Wibsen, do you have the information I requested?\"\n>\n> With his deeply creased face and rough voice, the veteran seemed more\n> like a man of the outdoors than an intricate strategist. But no one in\n> Zimia knew more about military operations than he did.\n>\n> \"Some of it's good, some of it's bad. After crushing the government in\n> Giedi City, the machines kept a robot fleet in orbit. Mop-up work on\n> the ground is being led by one Titan and a lot of neo-cymeks.\" He\n> coughed, scowled, and adjusted a medication dispenser implanted in his\n> sternum.\n>\n> \"Omnius can keep sending in more machines, or even manufacture\n> reinforcements using the captured industries of Giedi Prime,\" said\n> Pinquer Jibb, his voice urgent. \"Unless we get the secondary shield\n> complex working.\"\n>\n> \"Then that's what we have to do,\" Serena said. \"The Home Guard was\n> dispersed across the settled continent, and many of the outlying\n> regiments\n>\n> seem to have gone underground to form a fifth column. If we can\n> contact them, organize them, we might be able to damage the machine\n> conquerors.\"\n>\n> \"I can help with that,\" Jibb insisted. \"It's our only chance.\"\n>\n> \"I still think it's foolhardy,\" Wibsen said. \"But what the hell. I\n> didn't say I wasn't going to go.\"\n>\n> \"Is the ship ready?\" Serena asked, impatient.\n>\n> \"It is, but there's a great deal lacking in this operation, if you ask\n> me.\"\n>\n> Brigit Paterson said to Serena, \"I have secured detailed maps, plans,\n> and blueprints of all aspects of Giedi Prime and Giedi City, including\n> full functional diagrams of the subsidiary scrambler-shield\n> generators.\" She extended a stack of thin film sheets densely packed\n> with information. \"Pinquer says they're up to date.\"\n>\n> With boundless enthusiasm and passion, Serena had always demonstrated\n> skill in putting things together. Two years ago, she had led a relief\n> team to Caladan, an Unallied Planet where thousands of refugees from\n> the Synchronized Worlds had fled. On her most recent crusade, a year\n> ago, she had delivered three space transports full of medical supplies\n> to closed-off Tlulax, where the inhabitants were suffering from\n> mysterious diseases. Now that Tlulaxa flesh merchants had provided\n> medical aid and replacement organs from their biological tanks---\n> including saving her beloved Xavier--- she felt that her investment in\n> effort had paid off fully.\n>\n> Now Serena had called in favors, resulting in a mission that bore some\n> similiarities to her earlier successful efforts. She expected another\n> clear success, despite the dangers.\n>\n> With beatific confidence, Serena looked around the table again. She\n> envisioned the mission succeeding. Eleven people willing to challenge\n> a set of conquerors and overcome the odds. \"We have no higher\n> priorities.\"\n>\n> Ort Wibsen had worked between traditional channels to obtain a fast\n> blockade runner. Paterson's engineering crew had equipped the vessel\n> with the best experimental materials she could scavenge from weapons\n> manufactories. Using personal accounts and falsified documentation,\n> Serena had funded whatever the old commander needed. She wanted the\n> best possible chance for her impetuous mission to succeed.\n>\n> Serena said, \"Every person in the League has lost someone to the\n> thinking-machine onslaught, and now we're going to do something about\n> it.\"\n>\n> \"Let's get busy then,\" Pinquer Jibb said. \"Time for payback.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> THAT EVENING, ALONE in the grand dining hall, Serena and Xavier sat\n> across from each another. Servers bustled back and forth in\n> red-and-gold jackets and black trousers.\n>\n> As he sampled golden duckling fillets on his plate, Xavier talked\n> excitedly about Armada mobilization plans and methods of protecting\n> the League Worlds.\n>\n> \"Let's not talk business tonight.\" With a charming smile, Serena rose\n> to her feet and glided around the table, taking a seat next to him,\n> very close. \"I savor each moment with you, Xavier,\" she said, giving\n> nothing away about her plan.\n>\n> He smiled back at her. \"After the poison gas, I can't savor much else.\n> But you, Serena, are better than the finest banquet or the sweetest\n> perfume.\"\n>\n> Stroking his cheek, she said, \"I think we should tell the servants to\n> go to their quarters. My father is in the city and my sister is gone\n> for the evening. Should we waste this time alone?\"\n>\n> He reached out to brush her arm, then drew her close and grinned. \"I'm\n> not hungry anyway.\"\n>\n> \"I am.\" Passionately, she kissed his ear, then his cheek, finally\n> finding his mouth. He ran his fingers through her hair, touching the\n> back of her head and kissing her more deeply.\n>\n> They left the remnants of the fine meal on the table. She took his\n> hand and together they hurried to her chambers. The door was heavy,\n> and locked easily. She already had a fire lit in the fireplace, giving\n> the room an orange, cheery glow. They kissed again and again, trying\n> to unfasten laces and buttons and clips without breaking apart from\n> each other.\n>\n> Serena could barely control her urgency, not just to feel his intimate\n> touch, but to etch every sensation into her mind. He did not know that\n> she intended to slip away afterward, and she needed something to\n> remember about this night, to compensate for the time they would be\n> apart.\n>\n> His fingers were like fire as they traced down her naked back. She\n> could think of nothing but the moment as she pulled off his shirt.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WITH THE MEMORY of her lover's embrace still tingling along the nerves\n> of her body, Serena left the sleeping manor. She set out into the\n> quiet depths of night, bound to rendezvous with her team at a private\n> field on the outskirts of the Zimia spaceport.\n>\n> Anxious to be away, her optimism subduing her anxiety, Serena joined\n> her ten commando volunteers. Within the hour they departed in a fast,\n> cloud-gray blockade runner loaded with engineering tools, weapons, and\n> hope.\n>\n> *Religion, time and time again, brings down empires, rotting them from\n> within.*\n>\n> --- IBLIS GINJO,\n\nrearly planning for the Jihad\n\n> **T**he conquered planet Earth seemed to be a dumping ground for\n> grandiose monuments that celebrated the fictitious glories of the\n> Titans.\n>\n> Gazing from his vantage at yet another huge construction project\n> designed by the prideful imaginations of the cymeks, the crew leader\n> paced along a high wooden platform. His people were good workers,\n> dedicated to him--- but the work itself seemed pointless. When this\n> ornate pedestal was completed and shored up with reinforced arcs, it\n> would become the platform for a colossal statue representing the\n> idealized, long-lost human form of the Titan Ajax.\n>\n> As one of the most successful trustee humans on Earth, Iblis Ginjo\n> took his job very seriously. He scrutinized the throng of slaves\n> scurrying about below. He had convinced them to be enthusiastic,\n> drumming up their attentiveness through well-chosen phrases and\n> rewards . . . though Iblis hated to waste such loyalty and hard work\n> on a brutal bully such as Ajax.\n>\n> Still, every person had his part in the giant machine of civilization.\n> Iblis had to make sure there were no malfunctions, not on his watch.\n>\n> The crew leader was not required to be here; his subordinate trustees\n> could just as easily stand under the hot sun and supervise. But Iblis\n> preferred this to his other duties. Seeing him watch over them, the\n> slaves seemed to add a bit more to the tasks. He took pride in what\n> they could accomplish, if managed well, and they genuinely wanted to\n> please him.\n>\n> Otherwise, he would spend tedious hours involved in the processing of\n> new slaves and assigning them to various work crews. Often the\n> un-tamed ones\n>\n> needed special training, or resisted violently--- problems that\n> hindered the smooth flow of daily work.\n>\n> Erasmus, the strangely independent and eccentric robot, had recently\n> issued an order to inspect any *hrethgir* captives taken from newly\n> conquered Giedi Prime, in particular any human who showed qualities of\n> independence and leadership. Iblis would stay on the alert for a\n> suitable candidate . . . without drawing attention to himself.\n>\n> He didn't care about Omnius's goals for their own sake, but as a crew\n> leader he received certain considerations based on performance. Though\n> such perks made life tolerable, he distributed most of the rewards\n> among his crews.\n>\n> With a broad face and thick hair that fell across his brow, Iblis had\n> a strong, virile appearance. Able to get more work out of the slaves\n> than any other boss, he knew the best tools and incentives, the\n> manipulation of gentle promises rather than harsh threats. Food, rest\n> days, sexual services from the reproductive slaves--- whatever it took\n> to motivate them. He had even been asked to speak some of his thoughts\n> at the school for trustees, but his techniques were not widely adopted\n> among the other privileged humans.\n>\n> Most crew bosses relied on deprivation and torture, but Iblis\n> considered that a waste. He had risen to his position largely through\n> the force of his personality and the allegiance he engendered in his\n> slaves. Even difficult men invariably succumbed to his will. The\n> machines sensed this innate ability, so Omnius gave him the freedom to\n> do his work.\n>\n> At a glance, Iblis counted half a dozen monoliths around the hilltop\n> Forum, each pedestal containing the huge statue of one of the Twenty\n> Titans, beginning with Tlaloc, then Agamemnon, then Juno, Barbarossa,\n> Tamerlane, and Alexander. An immense likeness of Ajax would occupy the\n> one here, not because Ajax was so important, but because he was\n> violently impatient. Dante could wait, and Xerxes.\n>\n> Iblis couldn't remember the rest of the Titans off the top of his\n> head, but he always learned more than he wanted to know as each statue\n> was built. The\n>\n> work would never end. Iblis had been personally involved in every one\n> of the ostentatious sculptures over the past five years, first as a\n> construction slave and later as crew boss.\n>\n> It was late in the summer season, warmer than usual. Heat devils\n> danced off rooftops around the Forum. Directly under him on the dusty\n> ground, his construction crew wore drab browns, grays, and blacks---\n> durable clothing that required only occasional washing or repairs.\n>\n> Below Iblis's platform, a team boss bellowed out orders. Supervisory\n> robots moved about, making no move to assist the straining laborers.\n> Watcheyes floated overhead, recording everything for Omnius. Iblis\n> hardly noticed them anymore. Humans were industrious, ingenious,\n> and--- unlike machines--- flexible, as long as they were given\n> incentives and rewards, encouraged in the proper ways, guided to the\n> best behavior. The thinking machines could not understand the\n> subtleties, but Iblis knew that each minor reward he gave his workers\n> was an investment that paid off tenfold.\n>\n> According to tradition, the slaves often sang work songs and engaged\n> in boisterous team competitions; they were silent now, groaning as\n> they hauled structural blocks into place though in their habitation\n> hives, workers sometimes grumbled about the labor. The cymeks were\n> anxious to see the pedestal completed so they could erect the statue\n> of Ajax, which was being fabricated elsewhere by another crew. Each\n> segment of the project followed a rigid schedule, with no excuses\n> permitted for lateness or shoddy quality.\n>\n> For now, Iblis was glad his people could work in peace, without the\n> intimidating scrutiny of Ajax. Iblis did not know where the Titan\n> might be at the moment, but could only hope he would prey on other\n> hapless individuals today. Iblis had work to do and a schedule to\n> keep.\n>\n> In his opinion, the monoliths were useless--- huge obelisks, pillars,\n> statues, and Grogyptian facades for empty, unnecessary buildings. But\n> it was not his position to question such time-consuming projects.\n> Iblis knew full well that the monuments fulfilled an important\n> psychological need for the usurped\n>\n> tyrants. Besides, such work kept slaves busy and gave them visible\n> results of their labor.\n>\n> Following their humiliating overthrow by Omnius centuries ago, the\n> Titans had constantly scrambled to recover lost status. Iblis thought\n> the cymeks went overboard, building cyclopean statues and pyramids\n> just to make themselves feel more important. They strutted around in\n> showy but old-fashioned machine bodies, bragging about military\n> conquests.\n>\n> Iblis wondered how much of it was really true. After all, how could\n> anyone question those who controlled history? The wild humans in the\n> unruly League worlds probably had a different view of the conquests.\n>\n> He wiped sweat from his brow and smelled the gritty dust that rose\n> from the work below. He looked at the electronic notepad in his hand,\n> checking the progress against the schedule tally. Everything was\n> proceeding well, as expected.\n>\n> With his sharp eyes, he spotted a man leaning against a shaded wall,\n> taking an unauthorized rest. With a smile, Iblis pointed an\n> \"encourager\" pulse weapon at him and skimmed the man's left leg with a\n> beam of energy. The slave slapped the hot spot on his skin and whirled\n> to look up at Iblis.\n>\n> \"Are you trying to make me look bad?\" Iblis yelled. \"What if Ajax came\n> around and saw you falling asleep there? Would he kill you first, or\n> me?\"\n>\n> Abashed, the man shouldered his way into the crowd of sweating\n> laborers, where he resumed his work with renewed vigor.\n>\n> Some work bosses found it necessary to kill slaves as examples to the\n> others, but Iblis had never resorted to that tactic and vowed that he\n> never would. He was certain it would break the inexplicable spell he\n> had over the men. Instead, he only had to show disappointment in them,\n> and they worked harder.\n>\n> Every few days he delivered stirring, impromptu speeches. On such\n> occasions the slaves received water and rest breaks, giving them\n> renewed\n>\n> energy that more than made up for the time spent. The way he strung\n> phrases together often brought cheers and enthusiasm, and only a few\n> questions from bold slaves who wondered why they should be excited\n> about yet another monument. The work leader's talent lay in being\n> utterly *convincing*.\n>\n> Iblis hated the machine overlords, but concealed his feelings so\n> effectively that his superiors actually trusted him. Now, in a\n> fanciful moment, he envisioned destroying the computer evermind and\n> installing himself in its place. Much more than a mere trustee. Think\n> of it--- Iblis Ginjo, ruler of all, knower of all!\n>\n> He caught himself and dispelled the foolish daydream. Reality was a\n> harsh teacher, like the sight of a cymek on a beautiful day. If Iblis\n> didn't complete the obelisk pedestal in time, Ajax would devise an\n> extravagant punishment for them all.\n>\n> The work leader didn't dare fall behind schedule.\n\n*Each of us influences the actions of the people we know.*\n\n--- XAVIER HARKONNEN,\n\ncomment to his men\n\n> **F**or days, Tercero Xavier Harkonnen stayed up late working on\n> defensive plans for the League. Since his sweet night with Serena--- a\n> sparkling promise of their future--- he had devoted himself to the\n> protection of free humanity.\n>\n> On Salusa he flew practice missions, drilled new fighters, increased\n> the number of picket ships on the system's perimeter for a stronger\n> first defense, and extended the scanning network to provide a better\n> early-warning capability from deep space. Engineers and scientists\n> dismantled and studied the warrior-forms abandoned by the cymeks and\n> left behind in the ruins of Zimia, hoping to find flaws or weaknesses.\n> With each breath in his replacement lungs, he felt outrage against the\n> thinking machines.\n>\n> He wanted to spend more time with Serena, dreaming of where they would\n> go after the wedding, but driven by anger and private guilt about\n> Giedi Prime, Xavier buried himself in work. If he had concentrated on\n> the primary mission there, rather than mooning like a lovesick\n> schoolboy, he might have noticed the defensive flaw and helped the\n> Magnus to prepare. Even encouraging the immediate completion of the\n> secondary shield generator would have made all the difference. But it\n> was too late now.\n>\n> Seemingly inconsequential mistakes could lead to huge events. Xavier\n> promised himself that he would never lapse in his duties again, not\n> for any reason. If that meant spending less time with Serena, she\n> would understand.\n>\n> Emergency staff meetings resulted in a revision of the military\n> structure of the Armada, combining the resources and numerous warship\n> designs from all the planetary militias and home guards. The special\n> defensive needs and tactical significance of each League World were\n> discussed in detail.\n>\n> Armada recruitment surged to new levels. Manufactories worked overtime\n> to provide ships and weapons.\n>\n> Xavier hoped it would be enough.\n>\n> In his office on the top floor of the Joint Staff Building, electronic\n> star maps covered the walls. Printed charts and reports cluttered\n> every work surface. Each step of the way, he obtained the approval of\n> the Joint Staff Commander, who in turn reviewed key elements with\n> Viceroy Butler.\n>\n> When he slept at all, Xavier did so in his office or in the\n> underground barracks. For days he did not return home to the Tantor\n> estate, though his mother often sent eager young Vergyl to deliver\n> meals made especially for him.\n>\n> Oddly, he had not heard from Serena, and assumed the Viceroy's\n> daughter was occupied with vital duties of her own. The two young\n> lovers were alike in their ability to see large-scale priorities . . .\n> and in their independence.\n>\n> Determined to revamp League defenses, Xavier kept himself going with\n> stimulant capsules and drinks. He rarely noted what time of day or\n> night it was, heeding only the next meeting on his schedule. Now he\n> blinked through his office window at the quiet streets and the city\n> lights glittering in the darkness. How long had it been night time?\n> The hours merged with each other, carrying him along like a pebble in\n> a landslide.\n>\n> In the final tally, how much could one man actually accomplish? Were\n> some League Worlds already doomed, no matter what he did? Because of\n> the distances between planets and slow space travel, communication was\n> sluggish, and news was often stale by the time it reached Salusa\n> Secundus.\n>\n> His reliance on stimulants made him feel scratchy and ragged. He was\n> awake, but so pummeled by fatigue that he could no longer focus. He\n> heaved a huge sigh, staring blankly. At the side of the office, his\n> adjutant, Cuarto Jaymes Powder, had cleared a spot on a table and\n> rested his head on the polished wood.\n>\n> When the door opened, Cuarto Powder did not stir, or even snore, but\n> continued sleeping like the dead. Xavier was surprised to see Viceroy\n> Butler stride in, also weary to the core. \"We need to implement\n> whatever you've got ready, Xavier. Funding is guaranteed. For the sake\n> of morale, the people must *see* us doing something.\"\n>\n> \"I know, but we need more than one solution, sir. Have Lord Bludd\n> encourage Savant Holtzman to present any preliminary concepts he has\n> under development.\" He rubbed his eyes. \"If nothing else, we need new\n> options for our arsenal.\"\n>\n> \"We already talked about that last night, Xavier--- at great length.\"\n> The Viceroy looked at him strangely. \"Don't you remember? He has\n> several prototype units almost ready.\"\n>\n> \"Yes . . . of course. I was just reminding you.\"\n>\n> Xavier crossed the room and sat at an interactive information screen,\n> a high-security system that flirted with the dangers of a computer.\n> The electronic summary system could organize and provide vital data,\n> but had no self-awareness. Many nobles--- especially Bludd of\n> Poritrin--- resented the use of even such crude computers, but in\n> times such as these, the summary systems were vital.\n>\n> Passing his hand over the screen, Xavier made adjustments in his\n> report to Parliament, including a compendium of planet-specific\n> appendices, then printed the document, copies of which would be sent\n> to each League World. Presently he handed a neat stack to the Viceroy,\n> who perused the recommendations and signed his approval with a\n> flourish. Then Serena's father hurried out of the office, leaving the\n> door open behind him.\n>\n> At the table, Cuarto Powder stirred and sat up, bleary-eyed. Without a\n> word, Xavier settled into the chair at his own desk. Across the room,\n> the summary screen flashed in an aurora of light as technicians filled\n> it with probing signals to make certain the system exhibited no glints\n> of artificial intelligence.\n>\n> As his aide drifted off again, Xavier dozed as well. In his groggy\n> imagination he dreamed that Serena Butler was missing, along with a\n> ship and military team. It seemed surreal to him, but plausible . . .\n> then he realized with a start that he was not asleep at all anymore.\n>\n> Powder stood at his desk with another officer, listening to the bad\n> news. \"She's taken a blockade-runner, sir! Modified it with expensive\n> armor and weaponry. She has a group of commandos with her. An old\n> veteran, Ort Wibsen, agreed to lead them.\"\n>\n> Xavier struggled to throw off the confusion induced by weariness.\n> After rubbing his scratchy eyes he was surprised to see Serena's\n> wide-eyed sister Octa standing behind the men. In a pale hand she held\n> a gleaming black diamond necklace dangling from a coil of gold, which\n> she hurriedly handed to him.\n>\n> \"Serena told me to wait five days, and then give this to you.\" Octa\n> seemed ethereal, delicate; she moved to his side, but would not meet\n> his gaze.\n>\n> Searching for answers, Xavier removed the necklace from the coil. When\n> he touched the black diamonds, the perspiration on his hand activated\n> a tiny projector that showed a small holo image of Serena. He stared\n> at her, feeling astonishment and dread. The visual seemed to look\n> directly at him.\n>\n> \"Xavier, my love, I have gone to Giedi Prime. The League would have\n> argued the issue for months, while the conquered people suffer. I\n> can't permit that.\" Her smile was heartbreaking, but hopeful. \"I have\n> a team of the best engineers, commandos, and infiltration specialists.\n> We have all the equipment and expertise we need to slip in and\n> activate the secondary shield transmitter. We will complete the\n> construction and install the systems\n>\n> --- enabling us to cut off the planet from thinking machine ships,\n> while trapping the ones that are already there on the surface. You\n> must bring in the Armada and recapture this world. We're counting on\n> you. Think of how much we can help humanity!\"\n>\n> Xavier was unable to believe what he was hearing. The image of Serena\n> continued to speak her recorded message. \"I will be waiting there,\n> Xavier. I\n>\n> know you won't let me down.\"\n>\n> Xavier clenched his hands until his knuckles whitened. If anyone could\n> accomplish such a surprising mission, it was Serena Butler. She was\n> impetuous, but at least she was trying to do something. And she knew\n> her decision would force the rest of them to act.\n>\n> Octa began crying softly at his side. Viceroy Butler rushed into the\n> office, appalled at what he had heard.\n>\n> \"That's just like her,\" Xavier said. \"Now we have to rally a\n> response--- there's no choice.\"\n>\n> *Think of war as behavior.*\n\n--- GENERAL AGAMEMNON,\n\n*Memoirs*\n\n> **I**n an arena under the harsh sunlight of Earth's equatorial zone,\n> Agamemnon prepared to battle Omnius's gladiator machine. The evermind\n> treated these mock combats as challenges for the subservient Titans, a\n> way for them to vent their anger and keep them preoccupied. But\n> Agamemnon saw it as an opportunity to strike hard against his real\n> enemy.\n>\n> Two hundred and thirty years ago, human slaves and contractor robots\n> had completed this semicircular, open-roofed coliseum for Omnius's\n> flashy battles. The evermind enjoyed testing the destructive\n> capabilities of different robotic designs. Here, armored vehicles and\n> self-aware artillery systems could clash under controlled\n> circumstances.\n>\n> Long ago, the genius Barbarossa had programmed an appreciation for\n> combat and a thirst for conquest into the artificial intelligence that\n> had evolved into Omnius. Even a thousand years later the computer\n> evermind had never forgotten his taste for victory.\n>\n> Sometimes these staged competitions pitted humans against machines.\n> Randomly selected slaves from work gangs were given clubs, explosives,\n> or cutting beams and thrown into the arena to face combat robots. The\n> irrational violence of desperate humans never ceased to challenge the\n> calculating mind of Omnius. At other times, the omnipresent computer\n> preferred to demonstrate his own superiority against his cymeks.\n>\n> In anticipation of the next gladiatorial challenge, Agamemnon had\n> spent considerable effort in designing his new combat body. Omnius\n> sometimes pitted his sleekest, most sophisticated models against the\n> Titans; on other occasions, he responded with absurdly massive\n> monstrosities that would never have been viable in any real struggle.\n> It was all for show.\n>\n> Months ago, when Barbarossa had achieved a particularly fine victory\n> against Omnius, the cymek had demanded permission to attack the feral\n> humans as a reward. While the strike on Salusa Secundus had not gone\n> well, the Titans' second effort had conquered Giedi Prime. Barbarossa\n> was even now overseeing dozens of neo-cymeks in the subjugation of the\n> people there, a Titan once more in charge of a world. At last, it was\n> a step in the right direction . . .\n>\n> If he succeeded in winning in the arena today, Agamemnon had plans of\n> his own.\n>\n> With sirens blaring to announce the new event, Agamemnon rolled\n> forward on resilient walker pads and passed between the Corinthian\n> columns of Challenger's Gate. He could feel the thrumming strength of\n> his stepped-up mobility systems, the pulse of increased power surging\n> through his neurelectric pathways.\n>\n> Inside this gladiator-form, his low-slung body core consisted of a\n> pair of reinforced spheres--- one surrounded by opaque armor, the\n> other made of transparent alloyglas. Within the clear globe hung the\n> grayish white hemispheres of his human brain, drifting in a pale-blue\n> electrafluid and connected to thoughtrodes. Faint photon discharges\n> crackled along the cerebral lobes as the cymek body moved forward,\n> ready to fight.\n>\n> Around the double-sphere core, bulky drive motors hummed inside\n> protective cowlings. Engines worked the smooth hydraulics of four\n> grappling legs. Each articulated limb ended with a shifting mass of\n> adaptable metal polymer that could shape itself into a variety of\n> hardened weapons.\n>\n> Agamemnon had constructed this ferocious gladiator-form under the\n> buzzing gaze of watcheyes that monitored his every move. Omnius\n> supposedly filed all such information in a segregated portion of his\n> evermind, so as not to gain an unfair combat advantage. Or so Omnius\n> claimed.\n>\n> While Agamemnon waited, poised for battle, his opponent strode\n> forward, controlled directly by the evermind. Omnius had selected a\n> walking suit of exaggerated medieval armor: two massive legs with feet\n> like the foundations of a building and arms that ended in gauntleted\n> fists as large as the body core itself. The proportions were grossly\n> exaggerated, like a child's nightmare of a bully. Spikes extruded from\n> the massive knuckles on Omnius's goliath robot, and apocalyptic\n> discharges arced from point to point on the thorny fist.\n>\n> Agamemnon pushed forward on armored walker pads while raising his\n> crablike forelimbs, the adaptable-polymer ends of each morphing into\n> claws. Even if he won the contest today, the evermind would suffer\n> nothing, would not even have the grace to be humiliated in defeat.\n>\n> On the other hand, Omnius could accidentally destroy the Titan's brain\n> canister. Unforseen things happened in battle situations, and maybe\n> Omnius\n>\n> --- despite his programming that prevented him from intentionally\n> killing a Titan--- was counting on that. For Agamemnon, this fight was\n> for real.\n>\n> A few designated robotic observers watched from the stands through\n> enhanced optic threads, but they remained silent. Agamemnon did not\n> require applause anyway. The other polished stone seats in the\n> coliseum remained empty, reflecting daylight from the open sky. The\n> large stadium, like an echoing tomb, had all the room necessary for\n> two gigantic foes to clash.\n>\n> No announcement preceded the fight, no information piped over\n> loudspeakers. Agamemnon launched his attack first.\n>\n> The Titan raised his whiplike grappling arms, hardened them with a\n> shifting diamond film, and drove forward on heavy walker pads. With\n> surprising agility, Omnius's goliath robot lifted an enormous leg and\n> sidestepped the attack.\n>\n> Agamemnon lunged with another of his forelimbs, this one capped with a\n> spherical wrecking ball that fired disruptive, paralyzing energy. The\n> pulse thrummed through vulnerable systems, and Omnius's warrior\n> shuddered.\n>\n> Suddenly the goliath swiveled, raising a gauntleted fist to smash the\n> cymek's segmented arm. Even the diamond film could not endure the\n> blow, which bent Agamemnon's forelimb until it ripped from the\n> flexible socket. The cymek dismissed the damage and reversed his\n> walker pads, ejecting the unsalvageable limb. He swung up a cutting\n> arm that metamorphosed into a flurry of shimmering diamond blades.\n>\n> Agamemnon sawed through his opponent's armored torso, severing a set\n> of neurelectric control threads. Greenish fluid sprayed out from\n> chopped lubricant channels. The combat goliath swung his other spiked\n> fist, but Agamemnon danced his walker pads sideways and shifted his\n> vulnerable body core, keeping the brain canister safe.\n>\n> When his swing missed completely, the heavy blow overbalanced the\n> gladiator robot. Agamemnon brought up two slicing arms, hacking at the\n> goliath's arm joints with white-hot cutting irons. He found vulnerable\n> spots with surprising ease, and the goliath's right arm dangled\n> useless, a tangle of neurelectric fibers and conductive fluids.\n>\n> To assess the damage, Omnius dragged his unwieldy fighter two\n> thundering steps backward. Agamemnon pressed his advantage, closing to\n> grappling distance. Then he unleashed his first major surprise.\n>\n> From a concealed compartment within the old-fashioned engine housing,\n> a trapdoor irised open, and eight reinforced conductor-fiber cables\n> sprang out, each tipped with a magnetic connector claw. The cables\n> flew like a nest of startled vipers and slammed into the reeling\n> goliath. As soon as the tips struck home, Agamemnon released a huge\n> energy discharge. Lightning flared up and down the massive body of\n> Omnius's fighter.\n>\n> The cymek general expected this insidious blow to knock the combat\n> robot completely offline, but Omnius must have shielded his fighting\n> unit well. Agamemnon sent another paralytic pulse like a scorpion's\n> sting, but still the Omnius gladiator did not fall. Instead, as if in\n> anger, the machine swung its mammoth gauntlet with the force of a\n> colliding train, putting all of his energy and momentum behind a\n> single blow.\n>\n> The spiked fist struck true, slamming into the transparent\n> preservation sphere that held the disembodied brain. A major jamming\n> surge pulsed out of the knuckle spikes, and a shaped fracture wave\n> shattered the curved glass walls of the protected brain canister.\n> Through the breached container walls, electrafluid spilled like blue\n> gushing blood. Thoughtrodes tore, and the brain fell from its\n> suspender wires, dangling naked in the open, hot air.\n>\n> It might have been the death of Agamemnon.\n>\n> But the cymek general had devised his own trick. The brain inside the\n> transparent container was only a decoy, a synthetic reproduction of\n> his cerebral contours. Agamemnon's actual brain was inside the opaque\n> metal-walled sphere, from which he controlled the gladiator-form. Safe\n> and intact.\n>\n> He was, however, astonished and infuriated. Omnius had proven his\n> willingness to inflict severe damage on the most powerful and talented\n> Titan of all. Omnius's strong urge to avoid losing seemed capable of\n> overriding his programming restrictions. Or had the evermind known\n> about the ruse all along? Agamemnon launched his vindictive response.\n>\n> Even as he spun backward on his walker pads, roaring away as fast as\n> possible, he ejected the now-cracked sphere that contained the false\n> brain. He launched it into the body core of the goliath robot.\n>\n> In his specially constructed body, Agamemnon then ducked down, raising\n> his armored limbs and lowering his shielded brain canister between the\n> rows of thick walker pads to protect himself, like a turtle\n> withdrawing into a shell.\n>\n> The brain sphere struck the damaged gladiator and detonated. The\n> simulated brain had been sculpted from high-energy solid foam. Flames\n> roared past Agamemnon, charring the ground. The resulting explosion\n> bowled over the goliath robot, decapitating it, ripping open its\n> torso. The shockwave was sufficient to knock down part of the nearest\n> coliseum wall.\n>\n> Agamemnon had survived--- and the Omnius gladiator had fallen.\n>\n> \"Excellent, General!\" The computer voice echoed from loudspeakers in\n> the intact portion of the arena, sounding genuinely pleased. \"A most\n> refreshing and enjoyable maneuver.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon still wondered if Omnius had been aware that the visible\n> brain was false. Or perhaps the evermind had found a way to circumvent\n> the protective restrictions Barbarossa had installed so many years\n> ago. Now he would never be sure if the evermind was indeed willing to\n> let him die in combat. Maybe Omnius had to keep the ambitious Titans\n> from feeling too triumphant or overvalued, especially Agamemnon.\n>\n> Only Omnius knew for certain, one way or the other.\n>\n> Amid the smoke and flames rising from the ruin of the goliath machine,\n> Agamemnon raised his gladiator-form, the uncontested victor. \"I have\n> defeated you, Omnius. I wish to claim my reward.\"\n>\n> \"Naturally, General,\" he answered, sounding good-natured. \"You need\n> not even speak your wish. Yes, I shall allow you and your cymeks to\n> lead further strikes against the *hrethgir*. Go forth and enjoy\n> yourselves.\"\n>\n> *Survivors learn to adapt.*\n\n--- ZUFA CENVA,\n\nlecture to Sorceresses\n\n> **I**n the pristine, contoured cabin of the *Dream Voyager*, Vorian\n> Atreides and Seurat cruised between star systems again, picking up and\n> delivering Omnius updates to maintain congruence in the distributed\n> evermind across all the Synchronized Worlds. They exchanged updates\n> with other copies of the evermind, synchronizing the Omnius\n> incarnations, and departing with new data to be shared among the\n> widespread networks. Vor loved being a trustee.\n>\n> Days in space passed, each like the others. The oddly matched pair\n> performed their jobs efficiently. Seurat and the small cadre of\n> maintenance drones assured sterile cleanliness and optimal efficiency\n> in the cabins, while Vor occasionally left food or drink stains,\n> leaving a few items half-finished or in disarray.\n>\n> As he often did, Vor stood at an interactive console in the cramped\n> rear compartment, rummaging in the ship's database to obtain more\n> information about their destinations. He had been taught the benefits\n> of bettering himself in his training among the other privileged humans\n> on Earth. His father's example--- rising from an unknown man to become\n> the greatest of the Titans, conqueror of the Old Empire--- showed him\n> how much even a mere human could accomplish.\n>\n> He was surprised to see that the *Dream Voyager*'s normal route had\n> changed. \"Seurat! Why didn't you tell me we've added a new planet?\n> I've never heard of this . . . Giedi Prime in the Ophiuchi B system.\n> Previously it was listed as a solid League World.\"\n>\n> \"Omnius programmed that destination into our course before we departed\n> from Earth. He expected that your father would have conquered it by\n> the\n>\n> time we arrive. Omnius is confident in Agamemnon's ability to make\n> good after their failure on Salusa Secundus.\"\n>\n> Vor felt pride that his father would tame yet another unruly world for\n> the thinking machines. \"No doubt all will have gone well by the time\n> we arrive, and our forces will be mopping up.\"\n>\n> \"We will see when we get there,\" Seurat said. \"It is still months\n> away.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> ON MANY OCCASIONS they engaged in traditional human competitions from\n> the extensive databases, such as poker or backgammon; other times\n> Vorian would make up a new game, declare a set of absurd rules, and\n> then proceed to defeat Seurat, until the autonomous robot learned to\n> manipulate the rules for himself.\n>\n> The two were evenly matched, but with drastically different skill\n> sets. While Seurat was talented at intricate strategy and could\n> calculate many moves ahead, Vor often pulled off baffling innovative\n> twists to win. Seurat had trouble comprehending the human's erratic\n> behavior. \"I can follow the consequences in a logical progression from\n> an individual event, but I cannot understand how you manage to turn\n> impulsive and illogical behavior into an effective strategy. There is\n> no causal connection.\"\n>\n> Vor smiled at him. \"I'd hate to see you calculate an 'irrational'\n> response, old Metalmind. Leave it to the experts, like me.\"\n>\n> The son of Agamemnon was also quite proficient at military tactics and\n> strategies, a skill he had developed by studying the great battles of\n> ancient human history, as summarized in his father's extensive\n> memoirs. The cymek general made no secret that he hoped his son would\n> become an accomplished military genius one day.\n>\n> Whenever Seurat fell behind in a particular contest, he continued his\n> irritating habit of distracting Vor with jokes, trivia, or\n> anecdotes--- tailoring them to interest the brash young man. During\n> all the time the machine\n>\n> captain had known his human copilot, Seurat had accumulated and\n> assessed information, preparing it for future use. The robot captain\n> had become adept at raising topics that engrossed Vor and sent his\n> thoughts spinning.\n>\n> Seurat chattered incessantly about the legendary life of Agamemnon,\n> adding details Vor had never read in the memoirs: great battles the\n> Titans had won, planets they had added to the Synchronized Worlds, and\n> the warrior-forms Agamemnon had designed for private gladiatorial\n> contests. Once, the robot captain concocted an absurd tale about how\n> the great general had literally lost his mind. The cymek's protected\n> brain canister had accidentally detached from its walker-form and gone\n> tumbling down a hill, while the mechanical body, on automatic\n> programming, had to scamper about and find it.\n>\n> However, Vorian had recently uncovered information more unsettling\n> than anything the robot could ever reveal. Between games and\n> challenges, he often skimmed the open databases, reading his favorite\n> parts of his father's memoirs, trying to make sense of the reams of\n> Omnius's minutiae. On one of those excursions Vor discovered that over\n> the years, Agamemnon had sired twelve other sons. Vorian had never\n> assumed he was the only one--- but a dozen unknown brothers! The great\n> Titan general would naturally have wanted to create descendants worthy\n> of his legacy.\n>\n> Worse, he discovered that each of those dozen sons had proved to be a\n> failure. Agamemnon did not suffer disappointments gladly, and had\n> killed his unacceptable offspring, though they had been privileged\n> trustees just like Vor. The last had been executed nearly a century\n> ago. Now Vor was his father's best hope, but not necessarily the only\n> choice. Agamemnon must still have more sperm in storage . . . and thus\n> Vor was just as expendable as the others.\n>\n> After learning that, Vor became immune to Seurat's attempts at\n> distraction.\n>\n> Now Vor sat at the table, staring at a projected game board and\n> considering his next move. He knew Seurat could not determine what was\n> going on inside the unpredictable human mind. Even with all his\n> independent\n>\n> sophistication, the robot accumulated only external data and did not\n> recognize subtleties.\n>\n> The trustee smiled, just a little, which Seurat did not fail to\n> notice. \"You are playing a little trick on me? Exercising some secret\n> human power?\"\n>\n> Vor continued to smile and stare at the board. It was a multigame\n> competition, revolving inside a three-dimensional screen embedded in\n> the tabletop. Each player attempted to choose a contest or situation\n> that benefited him from a wide selection of games, and then make a\n> move. The score was tied, and the next point would win the contest.\n>\n> The various games came up at random, and each time Vor had only a few\n> seconds to make his move. He watched the shifting graphics as they\n> locked into place momentarily before moving on. The ancient Terran\n> game of Go appeared on the palette of selections; nothing there to\n> benefit him. More options flowed by. A machine-biased game appeared\n> next, one that required more memory than Vor had. He let it pass. Two\n> other games appeared that he didn't like, followed by a poker hand.\n>\n> Relying on luck and bluster, Vor faced off against the robot captain,\n> who could not understand the strategy of bluffing or the \"skill\" of\n> random odds. Vor's expression was unreadable, and he laughed at the\n> confusion he saw on Seurat's mirrored face.\n>\n> \"You lost,\" Vor said. \"And you lost, badly.\" He crossed his arms over\n> his chest, feeling smug after the robot finally folded his hand. \"It's\n> not just the score, but the way you tried to win.\"\n>\n> Seurat responded that he did not wish to play more games, and Vor\n> laughed at him. \"You're sulking, old Metalmind!\"\n>\n> \"I am reassessing my tactics.\"\n>\n> Vor reached across the table and pounded his opponent's slick\n> shoulder, as if to comfort him. \"Why don't you stay here and practice,\n> while I run the ship? Giedi Prime is still a long journey from here.\"\n\n> *Regrets, there are many, and I have my share.*\n\n--- SERENA BUTLER,\n\nrunpublished memoirs\n\n> **T**he cloud-gray blockade runner was not only fast and difficult to\n> see against the murky skies of Giedi Prime, it contained the most\n> sophisticated stealth profile of any craft in the League arsenal.\n> Serena hoped Ort Wibsen's crack abilities would be enough to get her\n> team through to the isolated island in the northern sea, where they\n> could begin their work.\n>\n> Pinquer Jibb had provided the blueprints, plans, and access codes for\n> the secondary shield-transmitting towers, if any of the systems\n> remained intact. But even with the excellent military advisors and\n> engineers, no part of this was going to be obvious or easy.\n>\n> After the long journey from Salusa, they now flew silently through the\n> darkened sky, studying the land mass below. Unnecessary parts of the\n> power grid had been shut down, cities plunged into barbarous\n> blackness. Machines, after all, could simply adjust their optic\n> sensors to see in the dark.\n>\n> Serena didn't know how many trained Home Guard members had survived.\n> She hoped some had gone underground after the thinking-machine\n> takeover, as the desperate courier Jibb had promised. Once her\n> commandos restored the scrambler shields, the Home Guard survivors\n> would be crucial in retaking the planet. She was counting on Xavier to\n> bring Armada ships into the fray, no matter what strings he had to\n> pull.\n>\n> Serena sat in the blockade runner's passenger compartment, anxious to\n> begin. By now, back on Salusa, her father would know she had gone, and\n> she hoped Xavier would already have launched his strike force for\n> Giedi Prime. If he didn't come, then their mission was doomed, and so\n> were she and her team.\n>\n> Xavier would be upset and worried about her, angry at the foolish risk\n> she had taken. But if she achieved results, all the effort would be\n> justified.\n>\n> Nothing remained but the task itself.\n>\n> Hunched forward in the cockpit, old Wibsen scanned the northern\n> regions to pinpoint the uncompleted transmitter station. Serena had\n> gleaned only a general location from Xavier's report, but she knew the\n> conquering machines wouldn't have bothered with an isolated arctic\n> island while subjugating Giedi Prime's population. So long as they\n> didn't call attention to themselves, perhaps Brigit Paterson's\n> engineers could complete their work without interference.\n>\n> The hardened veteran studied an instrument console, scratching his\n> rough cheek. After his forced retirement, Wibsen had never maintained\n> a crisp, spit-and-polish military appearance; now, at the conclusion\n> of their journey across space, he looked more rumpled than ever. But\n> Serena had not enlisted him for his wardrobe or his personal hygiene\n> habits.\n>\n> He watched streaks of light and blips on a scanner screen. \"There it\n> is. Must be the right island.\" With a satisfied grunt, he began\n> touching buttonpads like a musician playing a keyboard to reveal a\n> weaving but safe course through the machines'electronic sensor net.\n> \"The stealth film on our hull should let us slip right through their\n> surveillance. Sixty, seventy percent chance, I'd say.\"\n>\n> Serena accepted the grim reality. \"That's better odds than the people\n> of Giedi Prime have.\"\n>\n> \"At the moment,\" Wibsen said.\n>\n> Brigit Paterson stepped into the cockpit, not losing her balance as\n> the deck shook in buffeting winds. \"Most of the Armada wouldn't even\n> take the chance. They'd probably write off Giedi Prime until they had\n> a perfect, risk-free opportunity.\"\n>\n> \"We'll just have to show them how it's done,\" Wibsen said. Serena\n> wished Xavier could be here so they could make decisions together.\n>\n> The camouflaged blockade runner sliced through the murky atmosphere at\n> an efficient angle and approached the cold, leaden sea. \"Time to duck\n> out of sight,\" the veteran said. \"Hang on.\"\n>\n> The smooth ship plunged beneath the deep water like a hot iron. The\n> gush of steam was followed by hardly a ripple. Then, concealed by the\n> ocean, the craft glided north toward the coordinates of the rocky\n> island where a nervous Magnus Sumi had built his backup shield\n> transmitters.\n>\n> \"I'd say we're sufficiently out of sensor range,\" Serena said. \"We can\n> breathe easy for a while.\"\n>\n> Wibsen cocked an eyebrow. \"I hadn't even started to sweat yet.\"\n>\n> As if to disprove his remark, he fought to control a sudden coughing\n> spasm while he maneuvered the converted blockade runner through the\n> dim underwater currents.

Brigit Paterson nodded, all business. \"Even\n> so, we've got our work cut out for us.\"\n>\n> *In times of war, every person claims to contribute to the effort.\n> Some give lip service, some provide funds, but few are willing to\n> sacrifice everything. This, I believe, is why we have been unable to\n> defeat the thinking machines.*\n>\n> --- ZUFA CENVA,\n>\n> *The Rossak Weapon*\n>\n> **S**taring at fourteen of the strongest and most dedicated young\n> Sorceresses Rossak had ever produced, Zufa Cenva understood that these\n> women were not the sole hope for humanity. They were not the *only*\n> weapon against the terrible cymeks, not the most powerful blow the\n> League could strike. But they were critical to the war effort.\n>\n> Zufa stood in the fleshy underbrush with her trainees and looked at\n> them with compassion and love. No one in all the League Worlds was\n> more confident of success or devoted to victory. Her heart seemed\n> ready to burst as she saw them focusing every scrap of energy toward\n> the ultimate goal. If only everyone else could be as intent, the\n> thinking machines would be defeated in short order.\n>\n> As she had done for months now, Zufa led her elite group into the\n> jungle where they could practice their skills and summon the power\n> within their spirits. Each of these women was the equivalent of a\n> psychic warhead. Zufa, blessed from birth with more talents than any\n> of them, had been sharing her methods, pushing the others to their\n> limits. She had patiently taught them how to unleash incredible\n> telepathic abilities . . .and how to exercise control. The women had\n> performed admirably, beyond Zufa's most optimistic forecasts.\n>\n> But they must make their effort stand for something.\n>\n> Now she sat on a fallen silvery-barked log that was overgrown with a\n> thick cushion of shelf fungus. The canopy was dense with shadows that\n> interlocked high overhead. Dark purple foliage filtered the caustic\n> rainwater\n>\n> so that droplets trickling like tears to the mulchy ground were fresh\n> and drinkable. Large insects and spiny rodents tore through the soil\n> layers, oblivious to the testing the Sorceresses were about to begin.\n>\n> \"Concentrate. Relax . . . but be prepared to *focus* with all your\n> might, when I command you to do so.\" Zufa looked at the women, all of\n> them tall and pale, with translucent skin and shining white hair. They\n> looked like guardian angels, luminous beings sent to protect humanity\n> against the thinking machines. Could there be any other reason why God\n> had granted them such mental powers?\n>\n> Her gaze moved from face to determined face: Silin, the bold,\n> impulsive one; creative Camio, who improvised forms of attack; Tirbes,\n> still discovering her potential; Rucia, who always chose integrity;\n> Heoma, with the most raw power . . . and nine others. If Zufa were to\n> ask for a volunteer, she knew all of her chosen Sorceresses would\n> demand the honor.\n>\n> It was her task to select who would be the first martyr among them.\n> Xavier Harkonnen was already anxious to depart for Giedi Prime.\n>\n> She loved her trainees as if they were her children . . . and in a\n> very real sense, they were, for they were following her methods,\n> maximizing their potential. These young women were so different from\n> her own Norma. . . .\n>\n> Facing the chief Sorceress, the fourteen stood together, apparently\n> content and calm, but coiled within. Their eyes fell half closed.\n> Their nostrils flared as they breathed, counting heartbeats and using\n> innate biofeedback skills to alter bodily functions.\n>\n> \"Begin to build the power in your mind. Feel it like the static\n> electricity before a lightning storm.\" She saw their expressions\n> flicker as their thoughts stirred.\n>\n> \"Now increase the power one bit at a time. Envision it in your brain,\n> but do not lose control. One step, then another. Feel the energy\n> amplifying--- but do not release it. You must maintain your hold.\"\n>\n> Around her in the dimness of the fungoid jungle, Zufa felt the energy\n> crackling, building. She smiled.\n>\n> Zufa sat back on her log, feeling weak but not daring to show it. Her\n> recent difficult miscarriage, expelling Aurelius Venport's monstrous\n> child, had left her drained. But there was so much work to do, so much\n> she could not delay or delegate. The League Worlds were depending upon\n> her, especially now.\n>\n> Everyone had high expectations of the most powerful Sorceress, but\n> Zufa Cenva placed an even greater burden upon herself. At every turn,\n> her plans and dreams had been hamstrung when people refused to expend\n> the effort or take the necessary risks. These eager, talented trainees\n> seemed different, though, and she assured herself that they would\n> perform up to her standards. Too often when she measured other people,\n> she found them wanting.\n>\n> \"Another notch,\" she said. \"Intensify your power. See how far it can\n> go, but always be careful. An error at this point would wipe us all\n> out--- and the human race cannot afford to lose us.\"\n>\n> Psychic energy pulsed higher. The Sorceresses'pale hair began to drift\n> upward as if gravity had failed. \"Good. Good. Keep it going.\" Their\n> success delighted her.\n>\n> Zufa had never been interested in self-aggrandizement. She was a stern\n> and difficult taskmistress, with little patience or sympathy for the\n> failings of others. The chief Sorceress did not need wealth and profit\n> like Aurelius Venport, or accolades like Tio Holtzman, or even a show\n> of attention like Norma seemed to desire by convincing the Savant to\n> take her as his apprentice. If Zufa Cenva was impatient, she had a\n> right to be. This was a time of great crisis.\n>\n> The underbrush stirred as native insects and rodents scampered away\n> from the pounding psychic waves that built to a crescendo. Trees\n> rustled, leaves and twigs fluttering as if trying to break away from\n> their parent stalks and flee the jungle. Zufa narrowed her eyes and\n> studied her students.\n>\n> Now they were reaching the most dangerous part. The mental energy had\n> increased until their bodies began to shimmer and glow. Zufa had to\n> use her own skills to erect a protective barrier against the combined\n> psychic pressure on her mind. One slip and all would be lost.\n>\n> But she knew these dedicated apprentices would never make such a\n> mistake. They understood the stakes and the consequences. Zufa's heart\n> ached as she gazed upon them.\n>\n> One trainee, Heoma, displayed more strength than her companions. She\n> had built her power to a higher level while still maintaining control.\n> The destructive force could easily have become a wildfire in her brain\n> cells, but Heoma held onto it, staring with unseeing eyes as her hair\n> whipped like a storm.\n>\n> Suddenly, out of dense branches high above, a thick-bodied slarpon\n> dropped, a scaly creature with needle teeth and thick body armor. It\n> tumbled among the young women with a crash, disturbed from its\n> predatory perch and maddened by the backwash of mental energy. All\n> muscle and cartilage, it thrashed, snapping with powerful jaws and\n> scrabbling with thick talons.\n>\n> Startled, Tirbes twitched--- and Zufa felt an uncontrolled surge of\n> power spouting like a released jet of fire. \"No!\" she cried and\n> reached out, summoning her own powers to blanket the student's slip.\n> \"Control!\"\n>\n> Heoma, with perfect calm, pointed toward the slarpon as if she were\n> erasing a smudge on a magnetic board. She drew a line of psychic\n> destruction across the scaly predator. The slarpon burst into\n> white-hot flames, thrashing as its bones turned to charcoal, its skin\n> crackling and tearing until it flaked off in puffs of ash. Flames\n> smoldered out of its now-empty eye sockets.\n>\n> Heoma's companions struggled to clamp down and exert their mental\n> forces. But they had been distracted at a critical moment and were\n> losing their slippery grips on their telepathic battering rams.\n> Steadfastly, Heoma and Zufa maintained a superhuman calmness in their\n> midst, a stark contrast to their frenzied efforts. The combined\n> psychic force rippled and undulated.\n>\n> \"Back down,\" Zufa said, her lips trembling. \"Ease the power away. Draw\n> it into yourself. You must retain it and reel it back into your minds.\n> It is a battery, and you must maintain its charge.\"\n>\n> She breathed deeply, saw that all of her psychic warriors were doing\n> the same. One by one they inhaled, and gradually the tingle in the air\n> dissipated as they began to dampen their constant efforts.\n>\n> \"Enough for now. This is the best you've ever done.\" Zufa opened her\n> eyes and saw her students all staring back at her, Tirbes pale and\n> frightened, the others amazed at how close they had come to\n> self-annihilation. Heoma, an island apart, looked entirely unrattled.\n>\n> In a broad circle around them, the soft fungal underbrush was curled\n> and singed. Zufa studied the blackened foliage, fallen twigs, and\n> shriveled lichens. Another instant, a hair's breadth less control, and\n> everyone would have been vaporized in a ball of telepathic flames.\n>\n> But they had survived. The test had succeeded.\n>\n> After the tension finally evaporated, Zufa allowed herself a smile. \"I\n> am proud of all of you,\" she said, and meant it. \"You . . . my weapons\n> . . . will be ready as soon as the Armada arrives.\"\n>\n> *Mathematical answers are not always expressed numerically. How does\n> one calculate the worth of humanity, or of a single human life?*\n>\n> --- COGITOR KWYNA,\n\nCity of Introspection archives\n\n> **A**t Tio Holtzman's extravagant house, high on a bluff, Norma Cenva\n> spent three exhilarating days settling into her expansive laboratory\n> space. She had so much to do, so much to learn. Best of all, the\n> Savant was eager to listen to her ideas. She couldn't have asked for\n> more.\n>\n> Quiet Poritrin seemed so different from the dense, dangerous jungles\n> and lava-rock canyons of Rossak. She was anxious to explore the\n> streets and canals of Starda, which she could see from her high\n> windows.\n>\n> Tentatively, she asked Holtzman for permission to go down to the\n> river, where she had seen many people performing some kind of work.\n> She felt guilty for even asking, rather than working tirelessly on a\n> means to fight the thinking machines. \"My mind is a little tired,\n> Savant, and I am curious.\"\n>\n> Instead of looking at her skeptically, the scientist wholeheartedly\n> endorsed the idea, as if pleased to have an excuse to accompany her.\n> \"I remind you that we are paid to *think*, Norma. We can do that\n> anywhere.\" He shoved aside a sheet of doodles and sketches. \"Perhaps a\n> bit of sightseeing will inspire you to a work of genius. One can never\n> know when inspiration might strike, or where.\"\n>\n> He led her down a steep stairway that clung to a cliff over the Isana.\n> As she stood beside the taller man, Norma inhaled deeply of the\n> river's smell, sour and peaty from silt and vegetation dragged down\n> from the highlands. For the first time in her life, she felt giddy\n> with her own possibilities; the Savant was genuinely interested in her\n> imagination, her mind, and he listened to her suggestions, unlike the\n> constant scorn she had received from her mother.\n>\n> Norma raised an idea that had occurred to her that morning. \"Savant\n> Holtzman, I have studied your scrambler shields. I believe I\n> understand how they function, and I've been wondering if it might be\n> possible to . . . extend them somehow.\"\n>\n> The scientist showed guarded interest, as if afraid she might\n> criticize his invention. \"Extend them? They already stretch across\n> planetary atmospheres.\"\n>\n> \"I mean a different application entirely. Your scramblers are purely a\n> defensive concept. What if we used the same principles in an\n> *offensive* weapon?\" She watched his expression, detected puzzlement\n> but a willingness to listen.\n>\n> \"A weapon? How do you propose to accomplish that?\"\n>\n> Norma answered in a rush. \"What if we could make a . . . projector?\n> Transmit the field into a thinking machine stronghold, disrupt their\n> gelcircuitry brains. Almost like the electromagnetic pulse from an\n> atomic air burst.\"\n>\n> Holtzman's face lit with comprehension. \"Ah, now I see! Its range\n> would be quite limited, and power requirements off the scale. But\n> perhaps . . . it just might work. Enough to knock out the thinking\n> machines within a substantial radius.\" He tapped his chin, excited by\n> the idea. \"A projector--- good, good!\"\n>\n> They walked along the bank until they reached the foul-smelling\n> expanse of mudflats dotted with sloppy pools. Crews of ragged,\n> half-clothed slaves sloshed out onto the mudflats, some barefoot, some\n> wearing boots that extended to their upper thighs. At regular\n> intervals across the featureless field, flat pallets on pontoons held\n> metal barrels. Laborers marched back and forth to the barrels, where\n> they scooped dripping handfuls of the contents and went to plunge\n> their fingers into lines marked in the soft mud.\n>\n> \"What are they doing?\" Norma asked. It looked as if they were\n> embroidering the mudflats with their work.\n>\n> Holtzman squinted as if he had never considered the details. \"Ah! They\n> are planting clam seedlings, tiny shellfish that we raise from eggs\n> filtered out of the river water. Every spring, slaves plant hundreds\n> of thousands of them, maybe millions. I'm not certain.\" He shrugged.\n> \"The waters will rise again, cover the clam plantings, and then\n> recede. Every autumn, harvesting crews dig up the shellfish: clams as\n> big as your hand.\" He held up his right palm. \"Delicious, especially\n> when fried with butter and mushrooms.\"\n>\n> She frowned to watch the backbreaking labor, the sheer number of\n> people wading in the mud. The concept of captive workers remained\n> strange and unpleasant to her, even Holtzman's teams of solvers.\n>\n> The scientist didn't venture too close to the smell and the slaves,\n> despite Norma's obvious curiosity. \"It's wise to maintain our\n> distance.\"\n>\n> \"Savant, doesn't it strike you as somewhat . . . hypocritical that we\n> fight to keep humans free from the domination of machines, while at\n> the same time some of our own League Worlds use slaves?\"\n>\n> He seemed perplexed. \"But how else would Poritrin get any work done,\n> since we have no sophisticated machines?\" When he finally noticed\n> Norma's troubled look, it took him a moment to realize what bothered\n> her. \"Ah, I've forgotten that Rossak keeps no slaves! Isn't that\n> correct?\"\n>\n> She didn't want to sound critical of her host's way of life. \"We have\n> no need, Savant. Rossak's population is small, with plenty of\n> volunteers to scavenge in the jungles.\"\n>\n> \"I see. Well, Poritrin's economy is based on having hands and muscles\n> for constant labor. Long ago, our leaders signed an edict banning\n> machinery that involves any form of computerization, perhaps a little\n> more extreme than on some other League Worlds. We had no choice but to\n> turn to human labor, a manual workforce.\" Smiling broadly, he gestured\n> toward the mudflat crews. \"It's really not so bad, Norma. We feed and\n> clothe them. Bear in mind, these workers were taken from primitive\n> worlds where they lived squalid lives, dying of diseases and\n> malnourishment. This is paradise for them.\"\n>\n> \"They're all from the Unallied Planets?\"\n>\n> \"Leftovers from colonies of religious fanatics that fled the Old\n> Empire. All Buddislamics. They've fallen to distressing levels of\n> barbarism, barely civilized, living like animals. At least most of our\n> slaves receive a rudimentary education, especially the ones who work\n> for me.\"\n>\n> Norma shaded her eyes from the reflected sunlight and stared\n> skeptically at the bent-backed forms out on the mudflats. Would the\n> slaves agree with the scientist's blithe assessment?\n>\n> Holtzman's face hardened. \"Besides, these cowards owe a debt to\n> humanity, for not fighting the thinking machines as we did. Is it too\n> much to ask their descendants to help feed the survivors and veterans\n> who kept--- and still keep--- the machines at bay? These people\n> forfeited their right to freedom long ago, when they deserted the rest\n> of the human race.\"\n>\n> He seemed offhanded about it and not quite angry, as if the problem\n> was beneath him. \"We have more important work to do, Norma. You and I\n> have a debt to pay as well, and the League of Nobles is counting on\n> us.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THAT EVENING, GRIPPING the cool metal of a wrought-alloy railing, the\n> small woman gazed out from her balcony window at twinkling city\n> lights. Boats and barges on the Isana looked like waterlogged\n> fire-flies. In the gathering darkness, flaming rafts drifted out from\n> the slave sector, mobile bonfires that floated into the marshes. Each\n> fire rose and peaked, then diminished as the burning rafts sputtered\n> and sank.\n>\n> Humming to himself, Holtzman came to offer her a cup of seasoned tea,\n> and Norma asked him about the boats. Squinting out at the drifting\n> bonfires, he was slow to realize what the slaves were doing. \"Ah, must\n> be cremation rafts. The Isana takes the bodies away from the city, and\n> the ashes are carried out to sea. Basically efficient.\"\n>\n> \"But why are there so many of them?\" Norma pointed at the dozens of\n> flickering lights. \"Do slaves die that often, each day?\"\n>\n> Holtzman frowned. \"I heard something about a plague traveling through\n> the worker population. Most unfortunate, requiring a lot of effort to\n> replace them.\" He reassured her quickly, his eyes brightening.\n> \"Nothing you need worry about, though. Truly. We have plenty of good\n> medicines shipped here, enough to tend all the free citizens in Starda\n> if we should happen to fall ill, too.\"\n>\n> \"But what about all the slaves who are dying?\"\n>\n> His reply was not on point. \"Lord Bludd has requested replacements for\n> them. There's a standing order for healthy candidates these days. The\n> Tlulaxa flesh merchants are happy to harvest more men and women from\n> the outlying worlds. Life on Poritrin goes on.\" He reached down to pat\n> Norma's shoulder as if she were a child needing reassurance.\n>\n> From the balcony, she tried to count the floating fires, but soon gave\n> up the effort. Her tea tasted cold and bitter.\n>\n> Behind her, Holtzman continued happily, \"I very much like your idea of\n> using my scrambler-shield concept as a weapon. I am already thinking\n> of how to design a field-portable projector that could be deployed on\n> the ground.\"\n>\n> \"I understand,\" she said, her voice hesitant. \"I will work harder to\n> suggest new ideas.\"\n>\n> Even after he left, Norma could not tear her eyes from the funeral\n> barges blazing across the river, the floating cremation fires. She had\n> seen how the slaves labored in the mudflats planting clam seedlings\n> and in laboratory rooms calculating hundreds of equations. Now they\n> were dying in droves from a deadly fever . . . but were easily\n> replaced.\n>\n> The League of Nobles desperately sought to keep from being enslaved by\n> the thinking machines. Norma wondered about the hypocrisy here.\n\n*All men are* not*created equal, and that is the root of social unrest.*\n\n--- TLALOC,\n\n*A Time for Titans*\n\n> **T**he Tlulaxa slaving crew came down to Harmonthep like a weary\n> convoy instead of a squadron of military raiders.\n>\n> Tuk Keedair rode in the lead ship, but he left the piloting and\n> shooting to the newcomer Ryx Hannem. Not yet jaded to the\n> slave-acquisition business, young Hannem would be eager to please\n> Keedair, and the veteran flesh merchant wanted to see what this novice\n> was made of.\n>\n> Keedair had a flattened nose that had been broken twice in his youth;\n> he liked the way it had healed, imparting rugged character to his\n> wolfish face. In his right ear he wore a triangular gold earring\n> etched with a hieroglyphic mark that he refused to translate for\n> anyone. A thick black braid, tarnished with strands of gray, hung\n> between his shoulders at the left side of his face\n>\n> --- a mark of pride, since commercial tradition required a flesh\n> merchant to slice off the braid after any unprofitable year. And\n> Keedair's had grown long.\n>\n> \"Do we have coordinates yet?\" Hannem asked, looking nervously at his\n> control panel, then out the cockpit wind-shield. \"Where should we\n> start, sir?\"\n>\n> \"Harmonthep's an Unallied Planet, boy, and the Buddislamics don't\n> publish maps. We just look for a village and then harvest the people.\n> Nobody's keeping a census.\"\n>\n> Hannem peered through the viewer, searching for villages. The\n> clustered Tlulaxa ships cruised over a waterlogged green continent. No\n> mountains or hills rose above the soggy landscape of lakes, marshes,\n> and waterways. Harmonthep seemed to have an aversion to pushing its\n> land masses much above sea level. Even the oceans were shallow.\n>\n> After a few more runs, Keedair might take a long furlough back on\n> Tlulax, the closed-off world of his people. It was a nice place to\n> relax, though he was sure he'd get restless again before long. As a\n> \"procurer of human resources,\" Keedair had no regular home.\n>\n> The Tlulaxa biological industry had a constant demand for fresh\n> material, generated from new subjects, untapped genetic lines. By\n> imposing a high degree of secrecy on their work, the Tlulaxa had\n> managed to fool their innocent League customers. When the price was\n> right and the need great, the nobles easily swallowed stories of\n> sophisticated bio-tanks that could grow viable replacement organs. The\n> dedicated researchers eventually hoped to modify their clone-growth\n> tanks to produce such products, but the necessary technology had not\n> yet been attained.\n>\n> It was so much easier to just grab swarms of forgotten humans who\n> lived on outlying worlds. The kidnappings would never be noticed, and\n> the captives would all be carefully catalogued according to their\n> genetics.\n>\n> For the time being, though, the sudden shortage of viable slaves on\n> Poritrin had changed Keedair's business focus. As long as the plague\n> continued, it would be more profitable just to provide living\n> captives, warm bodies that needed no further processing. . . .\n>\n> As the slavers approached the tangled swamps, Keedair tapped the\n> scanned topographic map on his console screen. \"Fly low over that\n> broad stream and follow it. In my experience, you're likely to find\n> villages at a confluence of waterways.\"\n>\n> As the craft swooped down, he spotted large dark shapes moving in the\n> waters, serpentine creatures curling through bamboolike reeds. Huge\n> orange flowers bloomed on the tops of the stalks, opening and closing\n> like fleshy mouths. Keedair was glad he didn't have to stay on this\n> ugly world for long.\n>\n> \"I see something, sir!\" Hannem overlaid a magnified display on the\n> windscreen, pointing out a cluster of huts standing on poles within\n> the marshes.\n>\n> \"Good enough, boy.\" Keedair contacted the slaver ships in their wake.\n> \"Just like plucking fruit from a nobleman's garden.\"\n>\n> The marsh village did not look substantial. The round huts were made\n> of reeds and mud, fused with some sort of plastic cement. A few\n> antennas, mirrors, and wind collectors hung between them, although the\n> Buddislamics used little sophisticated technology. He doubted the\n> harvest from this single village would fill the holds, but he was\n> always optimistic. Business had been good lately.\n>\n> Three attack ships flanked Keedair's lead craft, while the Tlulaxa\n> human-cargo vessels were in the rear. Ryx Hannem looked uneasy as the\n> slavers approached the village. \"Are you sure we have sufficient\n> weaponry, sir? I've never been on a raid like this before.\"\n>\n> Keedair raised an eyebrow. \"These are Zensunnis, boy, pacifists to the\n> core. When the thinking machines came, these cowards didn't have the\n> balls to fight. I doubt we'll come out of it with so much as a bruise.\n> Trust me, you'll never see so much gnashing of teeth and wringing of\n> hands. They're pathetic.\"\n>\n> He opened the comchannel and spoke to his harvesting crew. \"Knock the\n> poles out from under three outlying huts and dump them into the water.\n> That'll bring people running out. Then we'll use stun-projectors.\" His\n> voice was calm, a bit bored. \"We'll have plenty of time to round up\n> the valuable ones. If there are any severe injuries, take them for the\n> organ stockpiles, but I'd prefer intact bodies.\"\n>\n> Hannem gazed at him worshipfully. Keedair spoke again into the\n> comchannel. \"There'll be profits enough for everyone, and a bonus for\n> each young male and fertile female you take without damage.\"\n>\n> The linked pilots raised a cheer, then the four raider ships swooped\n> toward the helpless swamp village. Young Hannem held back as the\n> more-experienced slavers flew in. With hot beams, they chopped through\n> the tall poles and let the rickety huts topple into the murky water.\n>\n> \"Well--- open fire, boy!\" Keedair said.\n>\n> Hannem discharged his weapons, disintegrating one of the thick support\n> legs and strafing open the side of a hut wall, setting the reeds on\n> fire.\n>\n> \"Not so much destruction,\" Keedair said, forcing a veneer of calm over\n> his impatience. \"You don't want to harm the villagers. We haven't even\n> had a chance to look them over yet.\"\n>\n> Just as he had predicted, the pathetic Zensunni came boiling out of\n> their huts. Some shimmied down ladders and poles to reach wobbly boats\n> tied up against their hovels.\n>\n> At the edge of the village, the two human-cargo ships landed in the\n> marsh water with hissing splashes, their friction-hot hulls creating\n> steam. Pontoons opened up to keep the ships afloat, and loading ramps\n> extended to solid-looking grassy hummocks.\n>\n> Keedair directed Hannem to land near the scurrying knots of people.\n> Some splashed into the waist-deep water, while women dragged children\n> into reed thickets and young men brandished spears that looked more\n> suitable for catching fish than for warfare.\n>\n> The first Tlulaxa raiders set down gently, extending flat-footed\n> landing struts that sank into the mud. By the time Keedair emerged\n> onto a mound of trampled grasses with his stun-projector in his hands,\n> his companions were already out and opening fire, selecting their\n> targets carefully.\n>\n> The healthy men were marked first, because they were worth the most on\n> the Poritrin market, and because they were the likeliest to cause\n> trouble, if given the chance.\n>\n> Keedair handed the stun weapon to a grinning but intimidated Ryx\n> Hannem. \"Better start shooting, boy, if you want to bag any of this\n> booty.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THE BOY ISHMAEL confidently guided his boat along the waterways,\n> threading his way through the maze of creeks and passages. The reeds\n> were much taller than his head, even when he stood up in the wobbly\n> little craft. The orange flowers at tops of the reeds opened and\n> closed with smacking sounds, feasting on gnats that drifted through\n> the air.\n>\n> Eight years old, Ishmael had been foraging by himself for a long time\n> now. His maternal grandfather, who had raised him after the death of\n> his parents, had taught him well. Ishmael knew how to unearth secret\n> stashes of qaraa eggs that even the giant eels couldn't find.\n>\n> He'd found a good patch of salad leaves and had caught two fish, one\n> of a species he'd never seen before. His basket clattered and jiggled\n> as the venomous creatures inside crawled up and down the walls,\n> thrusting spiny black legs through the tiny holes. He had captured\n> eighteen milkbugs today, too, each as large as his hand. The family\n> would eat well tonight!\n>\n> But as he approached the village, guiding his boat smoothly through\n> the brown water, Ishmael heard shouts and screams along with buzzing\n> sounds. Static discharges. Ishmael paddled quickly but cautiously. The\n> reeds were too tall for him to see anything.\n>\n> As he rounded an oxbow, he saw the slaver ships, one of the biggest\n> fears of his tribe and the reason they had built their village in such\n> an isolated place. Several huts had been toppled, while others were\n> afire. Impossible!\n>\n> The boy wanted to yell and charge in fighting, but better judgment\n> told him to flee. Ishmael watched Tlulaxa slavers pointing their\n> stun-projectors, dropping one villager after another. Some of the\n> people tried to hide inside dwellings, but raiders smashed their way\n> through.\n>\n> The Zensunni had no locks on their doors, no shielded places to hide.\n> As followers of Buddallah, they were a peaceful people. Never had\n> there been war among villages on Harmonthep; at least Ishmael had\n> never heard of such a thing.\n>\n> His heart pounded. Such a loud commotion would attract the giant eels,\n> though the predators were generally sluggish in the daytime. If these\n> raiders did not quickly retrieve stunned villagers who had fallen into\n> the water, the eels would have a feast. . . .\n>\n> Without making so much as a ripple on the water, Ishmael moved his\n> boat closer to one of the raider ships. He saw his cousin Taina\n> crumple from a stun-blast and then be grabbed by dirty-looking men who\n> loaded her motionless body onto a wide metal raft.\n>\n> Ishmael didn't know what to do. He heard a roaring sound in his\n> ears--- his own blood flowing, his gasping breath.\n>\n> Then his grandfather, Weyop, pushed forward to the center of the huts,\n> and faced the chaos. The old leader carried a thin bronze gong\n> dangling from a pole, symbol of his office as the village spokesman.\n> Ishmael's grandfather did not seem at all afraid, and the boy felt\n> instant relief. He had faith in the wise man, who always found a way\n> to resolve disputes. Weyop would save the villagers now.\n>\n> But deep in his heart, Ishmael felt a terrible dread, knowing that\n> this would not end so simply.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> RYX HANNEM PROVED to be a fairly good shot. After the novice had\n> stunned his first captive, he continued with enthusiasm. Keedair kept\n> a mental count, estimating the haul, though he would not have an\n> accurate tally until the unconscious bodies were placed inside stasis\n> coffins for transport.\n>\n> Keedair clenched his jaw as the Zensunnis wailed and pleaded---\n> probably in much the same manner as the population of Giedi Prime had\n> begged during the recent thinking-machine conquest. Keedair had\n> business associates in Giedi City, but he doubted he'd ever see them\n> alive again.\n>\n> No, he couldn't dredge up any sympathy for these Zensunni bastards.\n>\n> Hannem called attention to an old man who stepped forward. \"What does\n> he think he's doing, sir?\" The old man repeatedly banged a metallic\n> gong on a long staff. Hannem raised his stunner. \"Do we take him?\"\n>\n> Keedair shook his head. \"Too old. Don't even waste a stun-blast on\n> him.\"\n>\n> Two of the experienced slavers thought the same way. They broke the\n> tribal leader's staff and pushed him into the water, then laughed when\n> he shouted curses in a mixture of his native tongue and Galach, a\n> universal language among the human planets. The humiliated old man\n> swam to shore.\n>\n> The remaining villagers wailed and wept, but most of the healthy young\n> ones were already stunned and in the boats. Old women and dirty\n> children cried out, but attempted no resistance. Keedair looked\n> knowingly at Ryx Hannem.\n>\n> Suddenly a boy sprang out of the reeds behind them, jumping from a\n> narrow boat. He threw sticks at Hannem and Keedair, yelling something\n> about his grandfather. Keedair ducked. A rock narrowly missed him.\n>\n> Then the boy grabbed a basket out of his boat and hurled it at Hannem.\n> The flimsy wickerwork broke and spilled a swarm of huge spiny-legged\n> insects that tumbled over Hannem's chest and face, biting. The copilot\n> let out a thin shriek as he batted at the creatures, squashing them,\n> but they continued to scramble up his arms and clothes. Their smashed\n> bodies oozed a thick milky substance that looked like pus.\n>\n> Keedair grabbed Hannem's stun-projector and directed it at the scrappy\n> youth. As the boy fell, Keedair also sprayed his copilot with a\n> paralyzing blast. It wasn't the best way, but at least it\n> incapacitated the aggressive venomous insects, in addition to Hannem.\n> Once aboard the cargo ship, they would put the injured slaver into a\n> stasis coffin, along with the new captives. Keedair didn't know if the\n> lad would die, or just have nightmares for the rest of his life.\n>\n> He shouted for the rest of the Tlulaxa to gather up the unconscious\n> people. It looked as if they might need the second cargo ship after\n> all. *Not a bad*\n>\n> *day*, he thought. He studied the motionless form of the native boy;\n> the scrappy Zensunni youth was certainly impetuous and foolish. This\n> one would be a handful for whichever human master purchased him.\n>\n> But that wasn't Keedair's concern. Let Poritrin deal with the problem.\n> Even stunned and dirty, the wiry boy looked healthy enough, though\n> maybe a little young to take with the other slaves. Out of annoyance,\n> Keedair decided to include the youth anyway. This one had caused him\n> trouble and might need punishment, especially if Hannem ended up\n> dying.\n>\n> The old village elder stood on the shore, soaking wet, shouting\n> Buddislamic sutras at the raiders, telling them the errors of their\n> ways. Bodies floated in the water, facedown. Some of the desperate\n> villagers used poles to nudge the bodies back toward shore, sniveling\n> and wailing the whole time.\n>\n> Keedair saw large black serpentine forms swimming along the narrow\n> canals, attracted by the noise. One of them raised its head out of the\n> water and snapped a fang-filled mouth. The sight of the ferocious\n> animal sent a shudder down Keedair's back. Who knew what other\n> creatures lived around here?\n>\n> Anxious to be away from the stinking swamps, he urged his crew to\n> hurry. He watched as the new slaves were loaded onto the ships. He\n> would be glad to get back aboard his own clean vessel. Nevertheless,\n> the profits from this operation would be well worth the inconvenience\n> and discomfort.\n>\n> When all was ready, he climbed back into his own ship, started the\n> engines and retracted the mud-encrusted stabilizers. As he lifted off\n> into the hazy sky, Tuk Keedair looked down into the marsh and watched\n> the giant eels begin to feed on a few stray bodies.\n>\n> *Mind rules the universe.

Strong and dedicated, the\n> Sorceress Heoma appeared more than ready to answer the call.\n>\n> From her cliff city on Rossak, Zufa coordinated the operation with the\n> League Armada. The chief Sorceress bit her lower lip and blinked\n> stinging tears of pride from her eyes.\n>\n> Serena Butler's unexpected and ill-advised mission provided the\n> necessary impetus to galvanize the Armada into an offensive. Amidst\n> the arguing and saber-rattling, Xavier Harkonnen had put forth a\n> well-integrated operational plan for the attack. Then he had convinced\n> his commanding officer to let him spearhead the strike. Now, high over\n> Rossak, the battle group of ballista battleships and javelin\n> destroyers was ready to depart from the orbital stations.\n>\n> The initial retaliation against the machine invaders must be a\n> dramatic and complete victory, much more than a localized fight. Each\n> planet affected the others, like the links of a chain. Tercero\n> Harkonnen would lead an Armada battle group, carrying Tio Holtzman's\n> brand new field-portable scramblers to knock out key robotic\n> installations.\n>\n> A Sorceress, though, must deal with the cymeks, whose human brains\n> would be unaffected by the scrambler pulse. Eager for the opportunity,\n> Heoma had accepted her role without hesitation.\n>\n> She was a lean young woman, twenty-three years old, with ivory-white\n> hair, almond eyes, and a plain-featured face that belied the strength\n> and turmoil within her powerful mind. But Zufa knew more than just\n> this woman's\n>\n> mental skills; she knew Heoma as a dear person, a daughter like she\n> wished she'd had herself. Heoma was the eldest of five sisters; three\n> of the others had already been indoctrinated as Sorceress trainees.\n>\n> Zufa stood before her top prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and placed her hands on Heoma's bony\n> shoulders. \"You understand how much rides on this. I know you will not\n> disappoint me, or humanity.\"\n>\n> \"I will achieve everything you expect of me,\" Heoma promised. \"Perhaps\n> even more.\"\n>\n> Zufa's heart swelled. As the straight-backed Heoma boarded the\n> shuttle, the chief Sorceress called after her, \"You won't be alone. We\n> all ride on your wings.\"\n>\n> During the final preparations, with stern words and a hard expression,\n> Zufa had spoken to the strongest Rossak men, chastising them for their\n> inability to play a useful part in the crucial fight. Simply because\n> they were impotent telepathically did not preclude their participation\n> in other ways. The assault on Giedi Prime needed their help as well.\n> With her flinty gaze, the statuesque Sorceress had shamed six of them\n> into accompanying Heoma as bodyguards.\n>\n> The Rossak men brought their personal supplies of stimulants and\n> mind-numbing painkillers, provided by Aurelius Venport. They had\n> undergone rigorous weapons training and learned powerful hand-to-hand\n> combat techniques. When the time came, they would become fanatic\n> warriors, charging into battle with no concern for their own survival,\n> with no goal but to enable the Sorceress weapon to get close enough to\n> the cymeks. Venport had prepared the drugs carefully, creating a\n> cocktail that would keep the men functional through the worst horrors.\n>\n> As she watched the shuttle ascend in a silvery arc to the waiting\n> javelins and ballistas, Zufa's thoughts were in turmoil, full of\n> regret and anticipation. She tried to wall those emotions behind a\n> shield of confidence and a vow of duty.\n>\n> Aurelius Venport came to stand silently beside her, as if he too was\n> at a loss for words. The man was perceptive enough to pick up on\n> Zufa's sadness at seeing her prize student depart. \"It'll be all\n> right.\"\n>\n> \"No it won't. But she will succeed.\"\n>\n> Venport looked at her with a warm understanding that penetrated Zufa's\n> prickly demeanor. \"I know you wish you could have been the first\n> weapon yourself, my dear. Heoma is certainly talented, but *you* are\n> unquestionably more skilled than anyone. Just remember that you're\n> still recovering from your miscarriage, and that weakness might have\n> jeopardized the mission.\"\n>\n> \"And I am bound by the higher responsibility of training others.\" Zufa\n> watched the shuttle disappear into the thin clouds. \"I have no choice\n> but to remain here and do what I can.\"\n>\n> \"Funny. I was thinking the same thing about my own work.\"\n>\n> Recalling the gullible male bodyguards, the Sorceress studied her mate\n> with undisguised scorn. His patrician eyes were incisive, clear of\n> corrupting drugs, but his independent attitude grated on her. \"Why did\n> you not volunteer to join the operation, Aurelius? Or is it not in you\n> to do something selfless, beyond your perception of yourself?\"\n>\n> \"I am a patriot in my own way.\" Venport returned her expression with a\n> wry smile. \"But I never expect you to see it.\"\n>\n> She had no response for that, and the two of them continued to stare\n> blankly at the sky long after the shuttle had reached the stations in\n> orbit.\n>\n> *I don't believe there is such a thing as a \"lost cause\"--- only those\n> without suitably dedicated followers.*\n\n--- SERENA BUTLER,\n\n*address to League Parliament*\n\n> **D**espite Magnus Sumi's optimistic report, the secondary\n> shield-transmitting station on Giedi Prime was not at all near\n> completion.\n>\n> When Serena's covert team landed on the rocky, wind-swept island in\n> the northern sea, they spent a day bringing their supplies and\n> equipment to shore, breaking open the barracks buildings and\n> restarting the power-generating huts. The parabolic towers for the\n> scrambler-shield transmitters stood like frost-encrusted skeletons.\n> But none of the systems were functional.\n>\n> Once Brigit Paterson had scanned the status of the work, the engineer\n> came to Serena with a frown on her wind-chapped face. \"The best I can\n> say is that it won't be *impossible* to complete the work.\" She\n> shrugged her broad shoulders. \"The framework and heavy construction\n> are all completed, but most of the components have not yet been wired.\n> The substations aren't linked, and the cables haven't even been strung\n> to the highest girders.\" She pointed to the ice-slick bars moaning in\n> the breeze.\n>\n> Serena did not envy the volunteer who would climb up there and finish\n> the vital linkages. \"We don't know exactly when Xavier is bringing the\n> Armada for us, but if you're not done by the time those ships arrive,\n> we may as well not bother. We'll have let him down, along with the\n> people of Giedi Prime.\"\n>\n> Brigit summoned her engineers for an emergency meeting. \"We brought\n> enough stimulants along. We can work round the clock, provided we rig\n> area lighting to illuminate the platforms.\"\n>\n> \"Do it,\" Serena said, \"and press us into service if there's anything\n> we can do. Commander Wibsen was looking forward to a few days of rest,\n> but\n>\n> we'll shake him out of his bunk if we have to, and make him useful.\"\n> Brigit gave a wry smile. \"I'd like to see that.\"\n>\n> Over the next week they worked unmolested. The thinking machines did\n> not know they had sneaked in, or what they were doing. Suffering no\n> more than a few minor bruises, the team completed the most perilous\n> parts of the job. While the task was ninety-percent complete--- at\n> least, according to the plan on paper--- Brigit Paterson said the\n> remaining steps were the most time-consuming ones.\n>\n> \"We have to go component by component and harden the circuits. By\n> their very nature, these transmitting towers generate a field that\n> obliterates complex gelcircuitry. We need to make sure the system will\n> last more than five minutes once we activate it.\"\n>\n> Serena bit her lip and nodded. \"Yes, that would be a good thing.\"\n>\n> \"And if we're too obvious with our testing,\" Brigit continued, \"some\n> of the damned machines might figure out what we're doing. It's a\n> touchy process.\"\n>\n> \"How much time?\" Ort Wibsen asked, chewing on his own impatience.\n>\n> \"A week, if we're lucky.\" Brigit frowned. \"Ten days if anything goes\n> wrong and we need to fix pieces.\"\n>\n> \"Eight days is the absolute soonest the Armada could arrive,\" Serena\n> said. \"That assumes Xavier organized the attack force and launched\n> within two days of receiving my message.\"\n>\n> Wibsen grumbled, \"That'll never happen with the League. They'll call\n> meeting after meeting, then break for long lunches, then hold more\n> meetings.\"\n>\n> Serena sighed. \"I'm hoping Xavier can cut through all that.\"\n>\n> \"Yeah,\" Wibsen said, \"and I'm hoping the robots will all just leave\n> Giedi Prime voluntarily . . . but it's not bloody likely to happen.\"\n>\n> \"Keep your engineers busy,\" Serena said to Brigit Paterson, paying no\n> heed to the veteran's pessimism. \"Commander Wibsen and I will take the\n> blockade runner. We'll slip back through the sensor net and try to\n> intercept the incoming Armada. Xavier needs to know the plan so he can\n> take advantage of what we've done.

It's a\n> *remote* chance that I'll need any help.\"\n>\n> \"If you say so,\" Serena answered, covering a knowing smile. \"Brigit,\n> you'll be able to detect the Armada when they come into the system?\"\n>\n> \"We're monitoring the thinking-machine communications net. I'm\n> assuming once the Armada battleships approach, the robots will be all\n> atwitter with excitement.\" Brigit looked to her team and then gave a\n> grim smile. \"Yeah, we'll know.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> MOVING UNDERWATER AGAIN, the blockade runner cruised through the cold\n> depths away from the ice-choked northern sea. Looking over his\n> shoulder in the cockpit, Wibsen said philosophically, \"When we started\n> this mission, I thought you were crazy, Serena Butler.\"\n>\n> \"Crazy to try and help these people?\" She raised her eyebrows.\n>\n> \"No--- I thought you were crazy to give me another chance.\"\n>\n> According to his original mapping while guiding the ship through the\n> atmosphere, Ort Wibsen had identified weak spots in the robotic sensor\n> net girdling the planet. By emerging in the open sea at about forty\n> degrees north latitude, they could fly the stealth-coated vessel up\n> through the tenuous blanket with a reasonable chance of remaining\n> undetected by machine sentries in orbit and on the ground. The\n> patterns of observation flickered irregularly like invisible\n> spotlights across the open skies.\n>\n> \"We'll sit quietly here,\" he said, coughing again and slapping the\n> medical injector on his chest as if it were an annoying insect. \"We'll\n> bide our time until I'm damned sure I know their routine.\"\n>\n> \"That's one thing you can say about thinking machines,\" said Pinquer\n> Jibb, looking uneasy. \"They're certainly predictable.\"\n>\n> Cymeks, however, were not.\n>\n> Less than an hour later, fast-moving mechanical airfoils raced in,\n> converging on the half-submerged blockade runner. Wibsen cursed a\n> proverbial blue streak, then coughed up a mouthful of scarlet blood.\n>\n> \"Eleven of them!\" Pinquer Jibb cried, looking at the scanners. \"How\n> did they find us?\"\n>\n> \"How did you not see them?\" Wibsen snapped. \"They emerged from\n> underwater just like we did!\"\n>\n> Serena looked at the screen, seeing the numerous robot-driven\n> interceptor ships closing in on them. Activating the blockade runner's\n> starboard weaponry, she shot at the oncoming airfoils, hitting one and\n> missing the others. She had not been trained as a weapons officer. If\n> they'd expected to fight their way through, they never would have\n> taken on the challenge of infiltrating Giedi Prime.\n>\n> \"Jibb, take the controls and prepare for liftoff.\" Wibsen lurched out\n> of the cockpit. \"By hell, they'll not take us so easily.\" He jabbed a\n> big-knuckled finger at the copilot. \"Watch for your chance after I\n> leave--- and don't hesitate.\"\n>\n> \"What're you going to do?\" Serena asked. The old veteran didn't\n> answer, but raced across the deck and dove inside the single lifepod.\n>\n> \"What's he doing?\" Jibb said.\n>\n> \"No time to court-martial him now.\" Serena couldn't believe the\n> veteran would just leave them to the thinking machines.\n>\n> Wibsen sealed the hatch of the lifepod and green lights shone around\n> the rim, indicating he was preparing for launch.\n>\n> Serena shot another blast from the starboard weapons, the only ones\n> aimed toward the oncoming thinking machines. She crippled another\n> vessel, but in a united effort, the cymeks and robots fired at the\n> blockade runner, ripping open the weapons ports. Serena looked with\n> dismay at her control systems. They flickered, sparked, went dead.\n>\n> With a lurch and an explosive thump, Wibsen's lifepod shot out like a\n> cannonball. It roared away, a fast-moving, heavily armored projectile,\n> barely skimming over the surface. Over the SOS frequency, the old\n> veteran said, \"Don't be asleep at the switch, now. Be ready!\"\n>\n> Pinquer Jibb powered up their engines, preparing to fly. The ship\n> began to cut a line through the water.\n>\n> Wibsen did his best to aim the lifepod toward the robotic targets.\n> Designed simply to carry a survivor to safety from a catastrophic\n> explosion, the escape vessel had thick shielding and hull plating---\n> and when it hammered into the closest enemy, it annihilated the cymek\n> ship, blasting all the way through and slamming into a second.\n> Battered and smoking amid the sinking wreckage, the lifepod came to a\n> halt.\n>\n> Serena shouted to Jibb. \"Go! Take off!\"\n>\n> He increased thrust, and the blockade runner lifted off from the\n> water, heaving itself into the sky. As they climbed, Serena looked at\n> the imager that showed the water below.\n>\n> In the wreckage of the two thinking-machine aerofoils, she saw the\n> lifepod hatch open. Wibsen emerged, battered but still defiant. Around\n> him, smoke and steam roiled into the air, and three angry cymeks\n> churned toward him.\n>\n> The old veteran reached into his pocket and hurled a dull gray sphere\n> at the nearest cymek vessel. The explosion knocked the enemy back and\n> also sent Wibsen toppling into the lifepod's hatch. He waved a pulse\n> cartridge rifle unsteadily with one hand, shooting again and again,\n> but three armored cymeks pounced upon him from their own aerofoil\n> vessels. Serena watched in horror as their articulated mechanical\n> claws ripped the old veteran to pieces.\n>\n> \"Hold on!\" Pinquer Jibb shouted, too late. Serena saw robotic vessels\n> aiming their heavy weaponry along the trajectory of the fleeing\n> blockade runner.\n>\n> \"I can't---\"\n>\n> The impact smashed Serena against the far wall. Explosions ripped out\n> their ship's engines. The craft began to plunge, Jibb unable to\n> reverse their fall back toward the ocean. The blockade runner careened\n> into the waves like a huge out-of-control sled, spraying up a high\n> tail of white foam. Water began to gush through cracks in the hull.\n>\n> Serena ran to the weapons locker, grabbed a pulse cartridge rifle of\n> her own. Slinging the weapon over her shoulder, though she had never\n> fired one before, she made ready to defend herself. Pinquer Jibb\n> grabbed another weapon from the open armory closet.\n>\n> With clanging sounds like impacting torpedoes, cymeks slammed into the\n> crippled ship. Without even attempting to use the normal access\n> hatches,\n>\n> they cut their way through the hull, ripping into the central\n> compartment like birds trying to get at the tasty meat inside a\n> seashell.\n>\n> Jibb opened fire as the first silvery arms protruded through the split\n> wall. A pulse-bolt damaged the cymek's arm but also ricocheted around\n> the ship's interior, inadvertently blasting the breach even wider.\n>\n> Another cymek came in from the top hatch, prying open the armor and\n> dropping its limber body into the chamber. Serena launched a\n> pulse-bolt, scorching its core. With a lucky second shot, she fried\n> the brain canister. A larger cymek worked its way in from above,\n> grabbing the fallen mechanical body and using it as a shield as she\n> poured more pulse projectiles into it.\n>\n> Next to Pinquer Jibb, a cymek shaped like a black beetle continued to\n> work its way through the hole torn in the hull. The copilot turned and\n> attempted to fire again, but the cymek thrust a long pointed arm\n> forward. Jibb dropped his gun as the robotic arm plunged through his\n> chest like a spear. Blood blossomed from the center of his uniform.\n>\n> The morphing end of the sharp leg shaft suddenly sprouted clawlike\n> fingers, and as the cymek yanked his hand back out of his victim's\n> chest, he tore out the dripping heart and held it up like a trophy.\n>\n> Above, the largest cymek threw the nonfunctional body of his dead\n> mechanical companion at Serena. The heavy hulk crashed down, cutting\n> and bruising her. Trapped, she couldn't move, pinned to the deck.\n>\n> The beetle cymek, blood still dripping from its spearlike limb,\n> wrenched its way through the gaping hull and clattered forward,\n> leaving Jibb's body behind. It raised two more pointed forearms above\n> Serena, but the largest cymek bellowed for him to stop.\n>\n> \"Don't kill them both or we'll have nothing to give Erasmus. He asked\n> for one of the feisty resistance fighters from Giedi Prime. This one\n> will do nicely.\"\n>\n> Hearing his words, Serena was terrified. Something ominous in the tone\n> made her think she would be better off if she simply died here. Gashes\n> in her arm, her ribs, and her left leg were bleeding onto the deck.\n>\n> Jibb's killer snatched the pulse projectile rifle out of her hands,\n> while the larger cymek lifted away the fallen body. He stretched out a\n> grappling arm and snagged her with a flexible metal fist. The Titan\n> lifted her off the deck, then held her face close to his glittering\n> optic threads.\n>\n> \"Oh, so lovely. Even after a thousand years, I can still appreciate\n> beauty. If only I were human again, I could demonstrate my full\n> admiration.\" His sensors glinted cruelly. \"I am Barbarossa. It's a\n> shame I'll have to send you to Erasmus on Earth.

Though machines could settle and exploit virtually any\n> planet, the cymeks insisted on focusing on human-compatible worlds.\n> Though barren worlds seemed to be less trouble, the evermind\n> understood the desirability of both.\n>\n> When the work had been completed, Omnius used his watcheyes to observe\n> the flurry of launches--- five thousand probes simultaneously taking\n> flight, programmed to scatter to the farthest corners of the galaxy,\n> even if such flights took millennia. Timescales did not matter.\n>\n> Compact units shaped like bubbles, the soaring probes filled the sky\n> with sparkling lights and green exhaust plumes. At appropriate future\n> times, Omnius would reconnect with each of those mechanisms, one by\n> one.\n>\n> Thinking machines were capable of making long-term plans--- and living\n> to see them carried out. By the time humans expanded into those\n> distant star systems, Omnius would already be there.\n>\n> Waiting.\n>\n> *Each human being is a time machine.*\n>\n> --- Zensunni Fire Poetry\n>\n> **S**afe inside the ancient botanical testing station that had been\n> his sanctuary for months, Selim hunkered down while another ferocious\n> sandstorm blew across the desert. The weather was the only thing that\n> ever changed here.\n>\n> The tempest lasted six days and nights, whipping up dust and sand,\n> thickening the air so that the sun turned into murky twilight. He\n> could hear the howling rattle against the sturdy walls of the\n> prefabricated structures.\n>\n> He was not at all afraid. He was safe and protected . . . though a bit\n> bored.\n>\n> For the first time in his life, Selim was self-sufficient, no longer\n> captive to the whims of villagers who ordered him around because he\n> was of unknown parentage. He could hardly grasp the wealth at his\n> disposal, and he hadn't even begun to uncover all the strange\n> technological objects from the Old Empire.\n>\n> He remembered when he and his turncoat friend Ebrahim had scavenged\n> the desert with other Zensunni, including Naib Dhartha and his young\n> son Mahmad. Once, Selim had found a melted knob of fused circuitry,\n> obviously from an exploded ship. It had been sand-scoured into an\n> unusual, colorful conglomerate. He had wanted to give the trinket to\n> Glyffa, the old woman who had sometimes taken care of him. But Ebrahim\n> had grabbed the fused component and rushed off to show it to Naib\n> Dhartha, asking if he could keep it as a treasure. Instead, the Naib\n> had taken it from him and tossed it into a pile sold to a scrap\n> merchant. No one had given a thought for Selim. . . .\n>\n> Still, as the time in this place drifted into weeks he discovered\n> aspects and dimensions of loneliness. Day after day he sat in front of\n> the scratched windows, watching the storms fade, bringing bloodred\n> sunsets splashed with colorful hues. He looked out at the clean dunes\n> undulating toward the\n>\n> endless horizon. The immense mounds had metamorphosed like living\n> creatures, yet in essence they always remained the same.\n>\n> Across such an expanse, it seemed impossible that he would ever see\n> another human being again. But Buddallah would give him a sign of what\n> he was expected to do. He just hoped it came soon.\n>\n> Much of the time Selim occupied himself inside the empty station with\n> solitary games he'd learned to play when he was younger. In the\n> village, he had been ostracized by others who traced their paternity\n> back a dozen generations or more, even before the wanderers'arrival on\n> Arrakis.\n>\n> From the time he'd been a toddler, Selim had been raised by different\n> Zensunni, none of whom had adopted him as part of their family. He had\n> always been an impulsive and energetic lad. Any real mother would have\n> been patient with his mischievous misbehavior, but Selim had no real\n> mother. On Arrakis, where survival balanced on a razor's edge, few\n> would expend effort for a young man who seemed intent on making\n> nothing of himself.\n>\n> Once, he had accidentally spilled water--- an entire day's ration---\n> while working in a storage alcove. As punishment, Naib Dhartha had\n> denied him any fluids for two days, insisting that he must learn his\n> lesson if he was to be a part of the tribe. But Selim had never seen\n> such a punishment inflicted on any others who had committed comparable\n> mistakes.\n>\n> When he'd been only eight Standard Years old, he had gone exploring\n> out on the cliffs and rocks, hunting lizards, searching for hardy\n> weeds with edible roots. While he was out there a sandstorm had caught\n> him by surprise, hurling dust and grit against the mountains, forcing\n> him into shelter. Selim remembered how frightened he had been, hiding\n> alone for two days. When he'd finally made his way back to the cliff\n> city, expecting to be greeted with relief, he saw that none of the\n> Zensunnis had even noticed his disappearance.\n>\n> Conversely, Ebrahim, the son of a respected tribal father, had too\n> many siblings for anyone to pay attention to him. Perhaps to\n> compensate,\n>\n> Ebrahim got into a lot of trouble himself, constantly testing the\n> limits of the Naib's restrictions while cleverly making sure the\n> worthless waif Selim was around, just in case someone needed to be\n> blamed.\n>\n> As an unwanted scamp, Selim never experienced the parameters of true\n> comradeship. He had always accepted Ebrahim's manipulations at face\n> value, without considering the possibility that the other boy might be\n> taking advantage of him. Selim had been slow to learn his lesson, and\n> did so only after paying the price of exile into the desert, where he\n> was expected to die.\n>\n> But he had lived. He had ridden Shaitan, and Buddallah had guided him\n> to this hidden place. . . .\n>\n> While the long storms made him restless, Selim became more determined\n> in exploring the research station. He studied the banks of\n> sophisticated instruments and records but did not understand the\n> antique technology. He knew vaguely what the systems were meant to do,\n> but did not comprehend how to work the machines that had been\n> installed by Old Empire scientists. Since this station had remained\n> intact for hundreds, maybe thousands of years, it should be able to\n> withstand a bit of tinkering from a curious young man. . . .\n>\n> Some of the power cells were still active, barely, and he was able to\n> switch systems on, make panels glow. Finally he stumbled upon a way to\n> activate a log entry, a holorecording of a tall man with strange\n> facial features, large eyes, and pale skin. The bones of his face had\n> an unusual set, as if he came from a different race of humans. The\n> Imperial scientist wore bright garments, some metallic, others bearing\n> unusual designs. He and other researchers had been stationed here to\n> test the resources of Arrakis and assess its suitability for\n> colonization. But they had found little of interest.\n>\n> \"This will be our last recording,\" said the chief scientist in an\n> obscure Galach dialect that Selim found barely comprehensible. He\n> played the log entry five times before he understood the full message.\n>\n> \"Although our assignment is not yet complete, a new transport ship has\n> arrived at the local spaceport. The captain brought an urgent message\n> of\n>\n> turmoil and chaos in the Empire. A junta of tyrants has seized control\n> of our servile thinking machines and used them to take over the\n> galactic government. Our civilization is lost!\" Behind him, his\n> scientist companions whispered uneasily to one another.\n>\n> \"The captain of the transport ship must leave in a matter of days. We\n> cannot finish our survey work in that time, but if we do not depart\n> now, the continuing turmoil may disrupt travel across the Empire.\"\n>\n> Selim looked at the gathered researchers, with their troubled\n> expressions and distant, glazed-over eyes.\n>\n> \"It may take some time for the political leaders to resolve this\n> dispute and return our lives to normal. None of us wish to be stranded\n> in this awful place, so we will leave with the transport after sealing\n> all systems in our testing stations. Little remains to be discovered\n> in this Arrakis wasteland anyway, but if we ever return, we have made\n> certain that the stations will remain intact and operational, even if\n> the hiatus lasts for a few years.\"\n>\n> As the recording ended, Selim chuckled. \"It has been more than a few\n> years!\"\n>\n> But the images of the long-dead Empire scientists did not respond, and\n> only seemed to stare into the uncharted future. Selim wanted to share\n> his delight with someone, but could not. The desert still held him\n> prisoner.\n>\n> Nonetheless, he would find a way to escape.\n\n*Risk diminishes as our belief in fellow human beings rises.*\n\n--- XAVIER HARKONNEN,\n\nmilitary address\n\n> **S**even days.\n>\n> Brigit Paterson hadn't wanted to cut the time so close, but she worked\n> her crew hard.

Robotic battle vessels powered up, preparing to\n> launch into orbit as a massive, synchronized force to strike against\n> the *hrethgir* invaders.\n>\n> Brigit Paterson listened to the plans and smiled.\n>\n> Her secondary engineer hurried up to her, looking out at the\n> wind-swept rocky island. \"Shouldn't we turn on the scrambler shields?\n> They're all ready. What are you waiting for?\"\n>\n> Brigit looked at him. \"I'm waiting for the cocky robots to fall into\n> my trap.\"\n>\n> On crude screens installed in the unfinished facility, she watched a\n> hundred capital warships lift off from landing fields that had been\n> conquered during the original takeover.

In his comline, Xavier heard a report from his adjutant,\n> Cuarto Powder. \"Sir, the thinking machines are coming. Their missile\n> ports are open.\"\n>\n> Xavier issued the first command. \"Dispatch the ground assault\n> divisions . . . launch armored troop transports.\" The swarms of ships\n> carried the Sorceress Heoma and her Rossak bodyguards, as well as the\n> soldiers who would use the portable scramblers against the robot\n> warriors in Giedi City.\n>\n> Cuarto Powder suddenly looked up from his station, verifying the scans\n> his tactical officers had just forwarded to him. \"Sir, it looks as if\n> scrambler shields have just come on over the whole planet!\"\n>\n> Xavier's heart swelled. \"Exactly as Serena promised.\" The soldiers\n> cheered, but he smiled for a different reason entirely.

Before the staggering robots could\n> regain their feet, Heoma's bodyguards destroyed them with heavy\n> projectile fire.\n>\n> *Almost there.*\n>\n> Running at full tilt, she led the way toward the nexus of the\n> thinking-machine citadel, triggering alarms all the way. Many robots\n> had fallen inactive in rooms or halls, but others converged upon her.\n> Armored doors slammed shut in the corridors, as if to seal off vital\n> chambers, but Heoma could see they were not important. She saw exactly\n> where to go.\n>\n> Soon the cymeks would arrive and surround her. Exactly according to\n> plan.\n>\n> The tingle of mental electricity mounted in her brain like a power\n> transformer. Her skull felt ready to burst, but she did not unleash\n> her energy yet. She must retain all of her strength for one final\n> moment.\n>\n> She heard their crablike warrior-forms skittering down the corridor,\n> ominous sounds of sophisticated machine bodies guided by the brains of\n> human traitors, different from the regimented lockstep of the robotic\n> guards.\n>\n> \"It is almost our time,\" she announced to the fiery-eyed Rossak men,\n> her voice filled with excitement and barely suppressed fear.\n>\n> Skidding to a halt, she arrived within the main chamber where the\n> shielded core of the Omnius manifestation dwelled. Inside the armored\n> room, numerous watcheyes glared at her through glowing optic threads.\n>\n> A voice boomed out from myriad sources. \"Human--- are you wearing a\n> bomb, a pitifully weak explosive that you think can harm me? Did you\n> bring one of your atomics, or is victory not worth such a price to\n> you?\"\n>\n> \"I am not so na\u00efve, Omnius.\" Heoma tossed her sweaty white hair over\n> her shoulder. \"One person cannot possibly harm the great computer\n> evermind. That requires a much more extensive military strike. I'm no\n> more than one woman.\"\n>\n> As the giant cymeks approached from adjoining corridors, Omnius\n> simulated a laugh. \"Humans rarely admit the folly of their own\n> actions.\"\n>\n> \"I admitted no such thing.\" Heoma's skin was glowing red now, heated\n> with unnatural energy. Static electricity made her pale hair wave like\n> angry serpents. \"You have merely misjudged my purpose.\"\n>\n> The doors opened and three monstrous cymeks glided in with graceful\n> metal footsteps, as if savoring the capture of these humans. Heoma's\n> bodyguards turned and opened fire, using the last of their ammunition\n> to cripple one of the neo-cymeks in a single concerted attack.\n>\n> The second neo-cymek raised his integral weapons and vaporized the\n> fearless Rossak men into clouds of bloody pulp. The damaged neo-cymek\n> lay on the floor, its arms and legs twitching like a poisoned insect\n> not yet ready to succumb to death. The larger Titan cymek strode\n> forward.\n>\n> Now Heoma stood alone against the machines. Without moving, she\n> focused her mental powers, building to the point where she could\n> barely maintain even a shred of control.\n>\n> \"I am Barbarossa,\" said the cymek. \"I have squashed so many *hrethgir*\n> that it would take a computer to count them all.\" He and his companion\n> cymek came closer. \"Rarely have I witnessed such arrogance.\"\n>\n> \"Arrogance? Or confidence?\" Heoma smiled. \"Removing a Titan from the\n> equation is a worthy exchange for my life.\"\n>\n> The Sorceress's mental energy could do no damage to the hardened\n> gelcircuits of Omnius itself. Human minds, however, were more\n> vulnerable to her telepathic onslaught. She felt the flames of\n> vengeful energy cresting within her mind--- and released them in a\n> white-hot firestorm.\n>\n> The shockwave of psychic annihilation boiled the brains of Barbarossa\n> and his companion, as well as all other cymeks and hapless biologicals\n> crowded inside the citadel complex. Omnius let out a wordless bellow\n> of static and\n>\n> outrage. Heoma saw only white as her mental energy vaporized the\n> organic brains of the cymek generals.\n>\n> Leaving the newly installed evermind vulnerable.\n>\n> Outside, League ground troops waited for the telepathic firestorm to\n> fade, then surged forward to attack the now-defenseless stronghold of\n> Omnius.\n>\n> The work of recapturing Giedi Prime had begun.\n>\n> *Nothing is permanent.*\n>\n> --- Cogitor saying\n>\n> **W**ithin an hour of the transmitting facility's activation, the\n> cymeks and surface-confined robots had pinpointed its location. While\n> the battle raged in Giedi City, even after Barbarossa had been\n> annihilated, a kill squadron of neo-cymeks and robots was dispatched\n> to the northern sea. They surrounded the rocky, ice-covered island to\n> penetrate the compound and destroy the parabolic transmitting towers.\n>\n> With few weapons, Brigit Paterson's remaining engineers could not\n> possibly defend against such an onslaught, but they had no intention\n> of surrendering, either. Inside the main control center, she scanned\n> the skies and sea. \"The longer we hold out here, the more lives we'll\n> save.\"\n>\n> Pasty-faced and drawn with terror, the desperate engineers armed\n> themselves with grenades, pulse-projectile rifles, and a portable\n> artillery launcher and went to guard the quays and aerial approaches\n> to the island.\n>\n> The machine kill squadron did not issue ultimatums; they began their\n> attack as soon as they were in range. Brigit's engineers were ready\n> and fired back immediately. They reloaded, making their dwindling\n> ammunition count.\n>\n> The cymeks and robots were more intent on obliterating the towers than\n> on killing the few defenders.

When a cymek shot knocked one transmitter offline, the shields\n> began to fade, but Brigit finessed the controls. Her cold fingers\n> flew, rerouting to more stable sections of the tower, and soon she had\n> a functional shield in place again. She didn't know how long it would\n> last.\n>\n> Outside, she heard explosions and screams, making her wonder how many\n> of her engineers remained alive. Her screens flickered as the sensors\n> were damaged in the firestorm, and she saw more ships approaching,\n> probably machine reinforcements. A whole squadron.\n>\n> Then louder detonations rang out in the water, and the cymeks began to\n> scramble. Robot vessels exploded, targeted by oncoming kindjals flown\n> by human pilots. She heard a ragged cheer from a woefully small number\n> of voices. The League Armada had sent rescuers to defend the shield\n> facility.\n>\n> Weak with relief, Brigit slumped into her chair, glad that this risky\n> scheme had worked. When she got home, she promised she would buy\n> Serena Butler the finest, most expensive bottle of wine available in\n> the whole League of Nobles.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AFTER HEOMA'S MIND-STRIKE obliterated the cymek enforcers, Holtzman's\n> second portable scrambler knocked out the robots in another section of\n> the city. The Omnius core was damaged and vulnerable.\n>\n> Surviving robotic defenders mounted a strong resistance, willing to\n> sacrifice anything to keep humans from reclaiming the planet and\n> destroying the evermind. While Xavier Harkonnen fought against\n> thinking-machine spaceships in his giant ballistas, he dispatched four\n> javelin destroyers to help secure the surface. Squadron after squadron\n> of kindjals soared over targets, wrecking the embryonic machine\n> infrastructure, crippling any robots that had been beyond the range of\n> the field-portable scramblers.\n>\n> Armada troop transports dumped soldiers onto the battleground to seek\n> out and sabotage thinking-machine strongholds. Scanner ships sent\n> messages to rally any knots of human resistance, calling for others to\n> rise up and join the fighting.\n>\n> In response, distraught men, women, and children surged out of\n> buildings, breaking away from slave gangs. They ran through the\n> streets with any weapons they could find, some recovered from fallen\n> robots.\n>\n> As the tide of battle began to turn, Xavier issued a set of general\n> orders, delegating responsibilities and mop-up zones to the Armada\n>\n> subcommanders. Then he set out with elite search teams to find Serena\n> Butler.\n>\n> He flew directly to the island in the northern sea where commando\n> engineers had restored the shield-generating facility. He expected to\n> find Serena there, since this had been her scheme all along. Xavier\n> looked around, studying the bodies with dread, but saw no sign of\n> Serena or the old veteran Ort Wibsen. Nor did he see her blockade\n> runner.\n>\n> When he encountered Brigit Paterson standing outside in the cold\n> breeze without seeming to feel the chill, she was exuberant with their\n> victory. In a booming voice, she said, \"We did it, Tercero! I would\n> never have bet a single credit on our odds of success, but Serena knew\n> what she was doing. I can't believe she pulled us through.\"\n>\n> Xavier felt ready to melt with relief. \"Where is she?\"\n>\n> \"She's not with the Armada?\" Brigit frowned. \"She left here days ago\n> to intercept your ships and inform you of what we had accomplished.\"\n> She blinked, suddenly disturbed. \"We thought she'd given you all the\n> information.\"\n>\n> \"No, we came because of the message she left me on Salusa.\" Xavier's\n> heart leaped with sudden fear, and his voice dropped to a frigid\n> whisper. \"Something must have happened. God, I hope not.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> XAVIER TOOK A small contingent of kindjals with his best pilots.\n> Serena was lost somewhere on Giedi Prime. An entire planet provided an\n> overwhelming number of hiding places, but he vowed to find her.\n>\n> After leaving the engineering crew on the windswept island, had she\n> crashed? Had she been captured? Wibsen's service record showed him to\n> be an excellent pilot, and the converted blockade runner should have\n> performed well. But Serena and her remaining commandos had not\n>\n> responded to any Armada transmissions. So many things could have\n> happened.\n>\n> Bad things.\n>\n> The Armada had orders for the final phase of the operation on Giedi\n> Prime. Convoys were airlifting survivors away from the damaged\n> government complex in Giedi City. He hoped Serena was not in there.\n>\n> Ten kilometers above the surface, centered over the citadel that had\n> once been the home of Magnus Sumi, the squadron leveled out, and\n> Xavier knew it was time. Only a few months earlier, in those buildings\n> below, he and his inspection team had been hosted by the Magnus at a\n> banquet.\n>\n> Now Omnius must be excised like a cancer, obliterated from Giedi\n> Prime.\n>\n> Circling over the wounded metropolis, Xavier hesitated. His stomach\n> knotted, and he finally gave the order to his crew. The kindjals\n> disgorged their deadly loads.\n>\n> Xavier closed his eyes, then forced himself to watch the terrible\n> solution. This was the only way to be certain. Even if shreds of the\n> evermind had been distributed in substations around Giedi Prime, the\n> vigorous occupation force would root out any remnants. For now, the\n> humans must annihilate the computer core that cowered like an evil\n> insect queen in the citadel complex, cut off from all its\n> infrastructure, stripped of its machine protectors.\n>\n> Through the tattered smoke and cloud cover, Xavier watched a dozen\n> high-thermal bombs go off, blazing flashes and thunderclaps over the\n> center of Giedi City, vaporizing the government buildings. For blocks\n> around, even stone melted. Steel turned to ash. Glass vaporized.\n> Nothing could survive.\n>\n> A bittersweet victory . . . but victory nonetheless.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> DURING AN INSPECTION tour two days later, Tercero Harkonnen and his\n> line officers documented the decimation of Giedi City. They already\n> knew what they would find, but the harsh evidence sickened them.\n>\n> Xavier took a deep, shuddering breath and tried to salve his\n> conscience by reminding himself that Omnius had been defeated. The\n> humans had taken the planet back.\n>\n> But there was no sign of Serena.\n\n*There is always a way out, if you can recognize it.*\n\n--- VORIAN ATREIDES,\n\ndebriefing files\n\n> **A**s the *Dream Voyager* finally entered the Ophiuchi B solar system\n> as part of the long update run, Seurat attempted to contact the\n> recently installed Omnius network on Giedi Prime. If General Agamemnon\n> had conquered the *hrethgir* world, as promised, Vor knew they would\n> find the standard machine-run citadel at the world's business hub. It\n> would be another great chapter for his father to include in his\n> memoirs.\n>\n> Vorian stood behind the robot captain, studying the instrument console\n> as they approached. \"I'll bet there's still a lot of organizing and\n> restructuring to do down there.\" He was excited at the opportunity to\n> visit a world in the process of shifting from human unruliness to\n> efficient machine rule. Omnius would need to install the best\n> trustees, those most loyal to the thinking machines. Neo-cymeks would\n> probably take care of the brunt of the subjugation work, and trustees\n> would come in later, once the people were sufficiently tamed and\n> accepting of their new situation.\n>\n> But Vor also felt a little peculiar. The conquered *hrethgir* on Giedi\n> Prime would look like him, though he would feel no kinship with them.\n> *Seurat, and others like him, are more like brothers to me.*\n>\n> At the command console, the robot attempted to lock an onboard signal\n> onto a homing beacon from the citadel. \"No contact yet. Perhaps all\n> the systems are not yet installed on the surface, or Agamemnon caused\n> too much damage during his conquest.\"\n>\n> Vor tended to the monitoring systems. \"Damage can always be repaired,\n> once conquest is assured.\" Ahead, Giedi Prime was illuminated on its\n> dayside by a pale yellow sun. As he stared, his brow furrowed with\n> worry. \"Something doesn't seem quite right, Seurat.\"\n>\n> \"Define your reservations, Vorian Atreides. I can take no action based\n> upon a vague uneasy feeling.\"\n>\n> \"Never mind. Just . . . be careful.\"\n>\n> The *Dream Voyager* skimmed the upper atmosphere, slicing through\n> clouds and scattered particulates that the ship's scoop system\n> analyzed as copious smoke. Could the *hrethgir* have been so vicious\n> and desperate that they had burned their own cities? What loathsome\n> creatures!\n>\n> His stomach lurched as onboard warning systems whined. Seurat promptly\n> altered course, halting their descent and gaining altitude again. \"It\n> appears the scrambler field remains intact on Giedi Prime.\"\n>\n> \"We almost flew into it!\" Vor cried. \"Does that mean---\"\n>\n> \"Perhaps General Agamemnon did not succeed in his conquest. Giedi\n> Prime is not as secure as we were led to expect.\"\n>\n> Irrationally confident that his father would not have failed, Vor ran\n> a sequence of scans. \"Instruments picking up League military equipment\n> on the surface, evidence of recent massive explosions in Giedi City.\"\n> The words caught in his throat. \"The central hub and the local Omnius\n> have been obliterated! All robots and cymeks appear to be destroyed as\n> well.\"\n>\n> \"I am scanning their broadband reports . . . collating a summary.\"\n> Without alarm, the robot recounted his understanding of the portable\n> scramblers, the powerful Sorceress of Rossak who had used mental\n> powers to obliterate the cymeks, then the overwhelming force of the\n> League Armada.\n>\n> Then Seurat said in a maddeningly calm voice, \"Vorian, a fleet of\n> *hrethgir* ships is coming around from behind the planet. They appear\n> to have been waiting for us in ambush.\"\n>\n> Outside, streaks of orange and blue tracer fire came close to hitting\n> the update craft, and the *Dream Voyager*'s automatic systems jolted\n> into\n>\n> evasive maneuvers. League kindjals streaked in like wolves. \"They're\n> barbarians,\" Vor said. \"Eager to destroy anything they don't like.\"\n>\n> Seurat said, \"We are under attack. And the *Dream Voyager* is not a\n> combat-programmed vessel.\" He continued to sound artificially jovial,\n> facetiously this time. \"Someday I will think of a joke about why it\n> takes so many humans to short-circuit an Omnius.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> ALERTED TO THE approach of a single thinking-machine vessel, Tercero\n> Xavier Harkonnen had moved his orbital battle group to the far side of\n> the planet. Some wreckage of robot warships still tumbled in a\n> dispersing swath; Omnius's forces had been completely destroyed.\n>\n> Xavier flew out in a personal kindjal, accompanied by a well-armed\n> squadron. He saw the update ship roar on a steep trajectory toward the\n> damaged main city, then swerve desperately upward as soon as the robot\n> captain detected the scrambler fields. \"Follow me! We can't let it get\n> away.\"\n>\n> Hungry for vengeance, his squadron hurled itself into the pursuit. At\n> the same time, he signaled the ground-based military forces that he\n> had an enemy craft in sight. Ahead, wavering in the crosshairs, the\n> *Dream Voyager* surged forward, trying to evade Armada weapons fire\n> and to escape back into space.\n>\n> Abruptly, Xavier was startled to hear a human voice--- or one that\n> *sounded* human--- coming over the comline. \"Hey, break off your\n> attack! This is a League ship. My name is Vorian Atreides. We have\n> boarded a machine craft and taken control. Stop trying to shoot us\n> down!\"\n>\n> Xavier tried to determine from the tenor if it really was a human\n> voice, or only a clever machine copy. Thinking machines were not\n> devious . . . unless there was a preserved cymek brain aboard. Some of\n> the kindjals dropped back, uncertain.\n>\n> \"Stay on your guard,\" Xavier said to his squadron, \"but cease fire\n> until we figure this out---\"\n>\n> Before he could finish his order, the suspicious ship looped and began\n> firing its own weapons, minimal defensive volleys that nevertheless\n> took the Armada fighters by surprise. One kindjal veered away, its\n> engines damaged.\n>\n> Xavier's console screen showed the image of a human face with dark\n> hair and shining fanatical eyes. A sleek, mirror-faced robot stood\n> next to him, his flexible copperfilm body rippling as he operated the\n> controls of the ship.\n>\n> *A human and a robot, working side by side?* Xavier couldn't believe\n> it.\n>\n> \"Open fire!\" he shouted. \"Destroy that ship.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> \"IT IS NOT wise to provoke them too much, Vorian,\" Seurat said,\n> maddeningly calm. \"I would rather leave here posthaste.\"\n>\n> \"I just gained us a few precious seconds, didn't I? You wouldn't have\n> thought of using a bluff.\" Vor couldn't stop grinning. He had read\n> similar words in the memoirs of Agamemnon and was glad to echo them.\n>\n> As the Armada commander took evasive maneuvers and rallied his kindjal\n> pilots, he hurled insults back at Vor on the comline. \"You are a\n> disgrace to humanity, a traitor!\"\n>\n> Vor laughed, proud of his place here. He quoted what he'd been taught\n> all his life. \"I am the pinnacle of humanity--- a trustee of Omnius,\n> the son of General Agamemnon.\"\n>\n> \"I apologize for interrupting your grand speech, Vorian, but I am\n> detecting more *hrethgir* ships,\" the robot said. \"More than we can\n> evade. Therefore, I am breaking off engagement. Our responsibility is\n> to protect the updates aboard. We have to make our report.\"\n>\n> Vor said grimly, \"If the Giedi Prime-- Omnius is already destroyed, we\n> will never have an update of what it did during its months of\n> operation here. We'll never know what he accomplished.\"\n>\n> \"A grievous loss,\" Seurat said.\n>\n> The robot guided the *Dream Voyager* toward orbit, farther from the\n> deadly scrambler fields. The acceleration pressed Vorian back into his\n> padded seat until he nearly lost consciousness. A squadron of\n> human-operated ships closed in on their tail, and the update ship\n> shuddered as an energy pulse hit the aft section.\n>\n> Seurat dodged, and another volley of blows pounded the hull, damaging\n> the armor plates. This vessel was not made to endure such punishment.\n> Vor heard onboard systems hissing, automated routines making temporary\n> repairs to the damaged parts. Another blast hit, even worse than the\n> others.\n>\n> \"We are operating on reserves,\" Seurat announced. Vor scanned the\n> ship's diagnostics himself, assessing the damage. The air in the cabin\n> began to smell acrid and smoky.\n>\n> The *Dream Voyager* lurched. More kindjals surrounded them, targeting\n> their engines. An explosion jarred Vor to his bones.\n>\n> \"We cannot tolerate much more of this,\" Seurat said. \"Our engines are\n> functioning at only a third of normal capacity, and I am flying as\n> fast as I can.\"\n>\n> \"Head into that high cloud,\" Vor said, as an idea suddenly occurred to\n> him. \"The water vapor is thick enough to act as a projection surface.\"\n>\n> Listening to his enthusiastic copilot, Seurat steered into a giant,\n> towering cloud. The damaged engines strained. More blows came from the\n> pursuing kindjals.\n>\n> Vor worked furiously at the controls, using the ship's sophisticated\n> systems to project virtual copies in its wake, electronic images of\n> the *Dream*\n>\n> *Voyager*. He had hoped to use the scheme in a tactical game with\n> Seurat . . . but this was a different sort of game. If it didn't work,\n> the already-damaged update ship would never survive.\n>\n> Moments later a hundred illusory *Dream Voyagers* seemed to surge\n> through the cloud, solido images reflected on the water vapor.\n> Momentarily confused, the pursuing squadron chased decoys.\n>\n> And the real prey limped away, its pilots stealing up into orbit and\n> hoping to remain unnoticed until they could get out of range. . . .\n>\n> *Even the expected can be a terrible shock when we have been holding\n> on to threads of hope.*\n>\n> --- XAVIER HARKONNEN\n>\n> **W**hile the survivors of Giedi Prime counted their dead, documented\n> the damage, and made plans for the future, Xavier felt hope fading. It\n> seemed that no one on the whole world had seen Serena Butler since\n> she'd departed from the island compound in the northern sea.\n>\n> He took twice his normal shifts aboard scout kindjals, flying regular\n> patterns over the settled continents, where thinking machines had\n> caused the most destruction. If Serena was alive, Xavier knew she\n> would never be hiding. Rather, the determined young woman would be in\n> the midst of the hardest work, taking charge as always.\n>\n> Flying eastward on the next scheduled search pattern, he watched the\n> yellow sun set behind him, leaving splashes of gold and orange in its\n> wake. A powerful gust buffeted his craft, and he fought to control it.\n> Xavier rose to a less-turbulent altitude above the jet-stream, while\n> his squadron followed him.\n>\n> Someday, after he and Serena were married, he could tell this story to\n> their children. His chest tightened at the thought, but he continued\n> his search, not daring to consider what he would do if something had\n> happened to her.\n>\n> From this altitude, Xavier could make out the major geographical\n> outlines of continents and seas as they soaked up the approaching\n> night. Through a powerful scope, he saw the center of a city and made\n> out clusters of lights marking human encampments. During their brief\n> and brutal rule, the machine conquerors had slaughtered countless\n> people and sent millions fleeing into the countryside.\n>\n> Now survivors began to filter back to their homes. Construction crews\n> had moved into the industrial complexes, where they ripped out machine\n> modifications and reestablished the production capacities that were\n>\n> necessary to repair dwelling units and distribute food and supplies.\n> Back in Giedi City, Armada experts pored over the ruined Omnius\n> citadel, analyzing the debris from the high-thermal attack. Only\n> scraps of twisted, burned-out hardware and an electronic signaling\n> mechanism remained.\n>\n> But full recovery would take a great deal of time.\n>\n> Xavier hated machines more than anything, but he also believed in\n> honor among men. He could not understand the turncoat Vorian Atreides,\n> who willingly flew beside a robot captain in a thinking-machine spy\n> ship. Brainwashed, obviously, but something in the young man's\n> arrogant demeanor suggested deep convictions . . . a fanatical,\n> single-minded passion. Atreides had claimed to be the \"son\" of\n> Agamemnon, the worst of the cymek Titans.\n>\n> Below, one of the squadron ships veered toward the water in the vast,\n> open sea. \"Tercero Harkonnen, I'm detecting debris in the water below.\n> Metallic wreckage of some sort.\"\n>\n> With sudden dread, Xavier said, \"Check it out.\"\n>\n> Two kindjals swooped down to the open sea. One pilot transmitted, \"The\n> mass and configuration suggests that it's the remains of a League ship\n> with military-grade armor. Maybe a blockade runner.\"\n>\n> \"Did we lose any ships of that type in our engagement?\" \"No, sir.\"\n>\n> \"Retrieve the wreckage,\" Xavier commanded, surprised at how steady his\n> voice sounded. \"We'll run an analysis.\" He didn't want to say it, but\n> knew that Serena and her team had taken such a craft out onto the open\n> sea, when departing from the transmitter facility.\n>\n> He thought of the shimmering image of Serena projected from the black\n> diamond necklace that Octa had given him. The memory was so sharp that\n> the achingly beautiful woman seemed to be standing in front of him\n> again,\n>\n> proud and determined with her misguided idea of helping the people of\n> Giedi Prime.\n>\n> As the crews gathered the scattered debris, Xavier saw that the hull\n> had been painted an unobtrusive gray with a film of stealth coating,\n> now blistered and peeled.\n>\n> He felt numb. \"We have to make certain, one way or the other.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> LATER, WHEN THE debris had been delivered to a temporary military\n> encampment in Giedi City, Xavier Harkonnen ordered a full examination\n> on any traces found in the interior of the destroyed craft. Other\n> parts of the wreckage seemed to have come from robotic aerofoils, but\n> he didn't care about that. His mind and body were numb with dread; the\n> conclusions seemed inescapable.\n>\n> Inside a battered lifepod not far from the downed blockade runner, the\n> recovery team also found the mangled remains of an old man, identified\n> as Ort Wibsen. All doubt dissipated. This had been Serena's vessel.\n>\n> They found more blood inside the waterlogged ship. Obviously they had\n> put up an extraordinary fight at the end. Xavier ran full DNA scans,\n> hoping for any result other than the one he feared most.\n>\n> But the results proved that the other victims had been the Home Guard\n> messenger Pinquer Jibb . . . and Serena Butler herself.\n>\n> *Serena. My love . . .*\n>\n> Hanging his head, Xavier tried to hold on to the unraveling strands of\n> hope. Perhaps the machines had only taken Serena prisoner. But that\n> was a ridiculously unrealistic possibility . . . and given cymek and\n> robot brutality, would that be a fate he could wish for?\n>\n> No, he would have to return to Salusa Secundus and deliver the news to\n> a distraught Manion Butler.\n>\n> There could be no doubt about it: Serena must be dead.\n>\n> *Whether we are rich, poor, strong, weak, intelligent, or stupid, the\n> thinking machines treat us as nothing more than meat.

These captives had been freshly harvested from Giedi Prime and\n> brought to Earth by order of Omnius.

He separated out a\n> muscular, mahogany-skinned man for assignment to the Ajax pedestal\n> project, smiling encouragement to him, then dispatched others to crews\n> that required more manpower.\n>\n> One of the last to emerge from the ship was a battered woman who,\n> despite the dark bruises on her face and arms and the weary shock in\n> her expression, carried herself with pride, showing internal strength\n> in every movement. This was the one for Erasmus. *Trouble*.\n>\n> Why would the robot be interested in her? He would probably just\n> vivisect her anyway. A waste. And a shame.\n>\n> Iblis called to her, but she ignored his gentle yet authoritative\n> tone. Finally, with some rough encouragement from the guard robots,\n> she stood in front of him. Though only of average height, the female\n> had striking lavender eyes, amber-brown hair, and a face that might be\n> pretty if cleansed of grime and anger.\n>\n> He smiled warmly, trying to reach out to her with a little charm. \"The\n> records say your name is Serena Linn\u00e9?\" He knew full well who she was.\n>\n> Iblis stared into her eyes and detected a spark of defiance there. She\n> held his gaze, as if she were his equal. \"Yes. My father was a minor\n> official in Giedi City, moderately well-off.\"\n>\n> \"Have you ever worked as a servant before?\" he inquired.\n>\n> \"I have always been a servant--- of the people.\"\n>\n> \"From now on, you serve Omnius.\" He softened his voice. \"I promise\n> you, it won't be so bad. Our workers are treated well here. Especially\n> intelligent ones like yourself. Perhaps you could even aspire to a\n> trusted, privileged position, if you have the intelligence and the\n> personality for it.\" Iblis smiled. \"However, wouldn't it be best if we\n> used your true name . . . Serena Butler?\"\n>\n> She glared at him. At least she didn't deny it. \"How did you know?\"\n>\n> \"After capturing you, Barbarossa inspected the wreckage of your\n> vessel. There were many clues aboard. You are fortunate the cymeks\n> never needed to interrogate you in further detail.\" He glanced at his\n> electronic notes. \"We know you are the daughter of Viceroy Manion\n> Butler. Were you trying to hide your identity out of fear that Omnius\n> might use you in some sort of blackmail scheme? I assure you, that\n> isn't the way the evermind thinks. Omnius would never have considered\n> such a thing.\"\n>\n> She raised her chin defiantly. \"My father would never surrender a\n> centimeter of territory, no matter what the machines do to me.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, yes, you're all very brave, I am sure.\" Iblis gave her a wry\n> smile, meant to be comforting. \"The rest is up to the robot Erasmus.\n> He has requested that you be assigned to his villa. He has taken a\n> particular interest in your circumstances. That's a good sign.\"\n>\n> \"He wishes to help me?\"\n>\n> \"I wouldn't go that far,\" he said with a hint of humor. \"I'm sure\n> Erasmus wants to *talk* with you. And talk and talk and talk. In the\n> end, it's quite likely he will drive you mad with his famous\n> curiosity.\"\n>\n> Iblis instructed other slaves to clean and properly reclothe this\n> female, and they followed the trustee's orders as if he were a machine\n> himself. Although her mannerisms exuded hostility and resentment,\n> Serena Butler did not waste effort on pointless resistance. She had a\n> brain, but her intelligence and spirit were bound to be crushed before\n> long.\n>\n> The routine medical check, however, revealed a surprise. She glared at\n> Iblis, trying to maintain her defensive wall of anger, but a glimmer\n> of curiosity flickered behind her odd lavender eyes. \"Are you aware\n> that you're pregnant? Or is that just an unfortunate accident?\" From\n> the way she reeled, he saw that her reaction was not feigned. \"Yes, by\n> now it appears about three months along. You must have suspected.\"\n>\n> \"That is none of your business.\" Her words were hard, as if she was\n> trying to maintain her hold on something stable. The news seemed to be\n> a greater blow to her than all the rough treatment she had endured\n> since capture.\n>\n> Iblis made a dismissive gesture. \"Every cell in your body is my\n> business--- at least until I deliver you to your new master.\n> Afterward, I will really begin to pity you.\"\n>\n> The independent robot would no doubt plan interesting experiments on\n> her and the fetus. . . .\n>\n> *The psychology of the human animal is malleable, with his personality\n> dependent upon the proximity of other members of the species and the\n> pressures exerted by them.*\n>\n> --- ERASMUS,\n\nlaboratory notes\n\n> **E**rasmus's villa stood as a towering edifice on a hilltop\n> overlooking the sea. On the inland side, the main building loomed high\n> in front of a lovely flagstone square beneath high turrets; toward the\n> coast, a cluster of bleak, crowded slave pens huddled on the opposite\n> side, where human captives lived like livestock.\n>\n> From the highest balconies, the robot found the dichotomy curious.\n>\n> Forming his metal polymer facefilm into a paternal mask, Erasmus\n> watched as two sentinel robots strode through a slave pen, hunting for\n> twin girls that he required for a new round of experiments. The\n> panicked humans scrambled away, but Erasmus didn't shift his pliable\n> face into a frown. His myriad optic threads scanned the lean and dirty\n> forms, assessing.\n>\n> He had seen the little girls a few days before, noting their short\n> black hair and brown eyes, but they seemed to be hiding somewhere.\n> Playing a game with him? The sentinels tore through a doorway into a\n> tunnel that led to another pen; finally, they transmitted back, \"We\n> have located the two subjects.\"\n>\n> *Good*, Erasmus thought, anticipating the intriguing work ahead. He\n> wanted to see if he could force one of the twin girls to kill the\n> other. It would be a landmark experiment, one that would reveal\n> important insights into moral boundaries and how siblings defined\n> them.\n>\n> He especially enjoyed working with identical twins. Over the years he\n> had processed dozens of pairs through his laboratory, compiling\n> detailed medical reports as well as intensive psychological studies.\n> He spent a great\n>\n> deal of effort on meticulous comparative autopsies, microanalyzing the\n> subtle differences in siblings who were genetic carbon-copies. The\n> slave masters working in the crowded pens had instructions to identify\n> and select any new sets among the captive populace on Earth.\n>\n> Finally, the squirming dark-haired twins stood in front of him, held\n> by the sentinel robots. He shifted his pliable facefilm into a calm\n> smile. One of the girls spat on the reflective surface. Erasmus\n> wondered why saliva carried such a negative connotation for humans? It\n> caused no damage and could be cleaned off easily. The forms of human\n> defiance never ceased to amaze him.\n>\n> Shortly before Erasmus had left his estate on Corrin, twenty-two\n> slaves had removed their protective eye films and intentionally stared\n> into the furious red-giant sun, blinding themselves. Disobedient,\n> resistant--- and stupid. What did the rebellious act accomplish, other\n> than rendering them useless for slave work?\n>\n> They had expected to be killed, and Erasmus would oblige them. But not\n> so that they could become martyrs. Instead, he had quietly separated\n> them from other workers to prevent the spread of their unruliness.\n> Blinded, they could not find or earn food. By now, he supposed they\n> must have starved in their self-inflicted darkness.\n>\n> Still, he had marveled at their spirit, their collective will to\n> challenge him. Even though humans were a troublesome breed, they were\n> constantly fascinating.\n>\n> A watcheye buzzed nearby, making strange, raw noises. Finally, Omnius\n> spoke through it. \"The recent loss of Giedi Prime is your fault,\n> Erasmus.

The alarming message had reached Earth only that morning.\n>\n> \"I was not given data that the Sorceresses of Rossak had developed\n> this capability of telepathic destruction.\" The robot's face shimmered\n> back into its blank oval smoothness. \"Why not also ask your questions\n> of Vorian Atreides when he returns to Earth? The son of Agamemnon has\n> helped us to simulate unstable human behavior before.\"\n>\n> Omnius said, \"Even his input could not have prepared us for what\n> happened to Giedi Prime.

A copy of me.\"\n>\n> \"You would sacrifice our fascinating, open-ended debates?\" Erasmus\n> responded, fighting to conceal his inner alarm. \"You have always\n> expressed an interest in my peculiar manner of thinking. All the\n> everminds especially look forward to your record of my actions.\"\n>\n> The buzzing of the watcheye intensified, indicating that Omnius was\n> shifting his thought pathways. This was a worrisome, volatile\n> situation. Erasmus did not want to lose his carefully developed\n> independent identity.\n>\n> One of the twin girls tried to break away from the robotic guards and\n> run back toward the dubious safety of the pens. As Erasmus had\n> suggested beforehand, the guard lifted her sister by one arm, leaving\n> her to dangle screaming. The free twin hesitated, though she could\n> easily have reached the temporary shelter. Slowly, she came to a stop,\n> surrendering.\n>\n> *Fascinating*, Erasmus thought. And the sentinel robot did not even\n> have to inflict cellular damage on the other girl.\n>\n> Thinking quickly, the robot said, \"Perhaps if I diverted my attention\n> to matters of military significance, you would more easily see the\n> potential of my work. Let me understand the mentality of these wild\n> humans for you. What drives them to such self-sacrifice, as we\n> witnessed on Giedi Prime? If I can distill an explanation, your\n> Synchronized Worlds will no longer be vulnerable to unpredictable\n> attacks.\"\n>\n> The watcheye hovered as a million possibilities showered through the\n> abundant mind of Omnius. Presently, the computer made his decision.\n> \"You have my permission to proceed. But do not continue to test my\n> patience.\"\n>\n> *People require continuity.*\n\n--- BOVKO MANRESA,\n\nFirst Viceroy of the League of Nobles\n\n> **O**n Poritrin, the virulent fever raced through the mudflats and\n> docks where slaves made their dreary homes. Despite the best\n> quarantine and mitigation efforts, the disease killed a number of\n> officials and merchants, and even spread as far as the slaves in Tio\n> Holtzman's blufftop laboratories, where it caused quite a disruption\n> in the scientist's work.\n>\n> When Holtzman first noticed symptoms of the illness among his crowded\n> equation solvers, he immediately ordered removal of the sick ones to\n> isolation chambers and sealed off the remainder of the calculating\n> teams. The distracted Savant thought the slaves would rejoice at being\n> relieved of their mathematical chores; instead the solvers moaned and\n> prayed, asking why the hand of God would strike *them* rather than\n> their oppressors.\n>\n> Within two weeks, half of his household slaves had either died or been\n> quarantined. Such a shift in daily routines was not conducive to the\n> Savant's mental work.\n>\n> Several large-scale simulations had been under way, following the\n> gradual development of parameters established by the talented Norma\n> Cenva. Groaning at the inconvenience, Holtzman knew that stopping the\n> lengthy work in midstream would necessitate new teams to start over\n> again. To maintain his stature, he needed a major breakthrough soon.\n>\n> Lately his reputation had been supported more by Norma's work than his\n> own. Naturally, he had taken full credit for modifying the\n> scrambler-field generators into an offensive weapon. Lord Bludd had\n> delighted in presenting two prototypes to the Armada liberation force\n> for Giedi Prime. Indeed, the scrambler projectors had served the\n> rescuers well, but the prototypes had consumed enough energy to ground\n> two troop transports, and the devices themselves had broken down---\n> irreparably--- after only one\n>\n> use. In addition, the disruptive pulse had yielded uneven results,\n> since many robots had been shielded by walls or unaffected by the\n> dissipating field. Still, the idea showed promise, and the nobles\n> urged Holtzman to work on improvements, without ever knowing about\n> Norma's involvement.\n>\n> At least Holtzman's reputation was secure again. For a while.\n>\n> Norma was quiet but diligent. Rarely interested in diversions or\n> amusements, she worked hard and scrutinized her own ideas. Despite\n> Holtzman's wishes, she insisted on performing most calculations\n> personally rather than handing them off to solver teams. Norma was too\n> independent to understand the economics of delegating tasks. Her\n> dedication made her a rather dull person.\n>\n> After rescuing the young prodigy from her obscurity on Rossak, he had\n> hoped, unrealistically perhaps, that Norma might provide him with\n> sudden inspiration. During a recent cocktail party in Lord Bludd's\n> conical towers, the nobleman had made a joke about Holtzman taking a\n> holiday from his usual brilliance. Though the comment had stung, the\n> inventor had laughed along with the other tittering nobles. Still, it\n> high-lighted--- in his own mind, at least--- that he had not created\n> anything really original in some time.\n>\n> Following a restless night of bizarre dreams, Holtzman finally came up\n> with a concept to explore. Expanding some of the electromagnetic\n> features he had used for his scrambler fields, he might be able to\n> create an \"alloy resonance generator.\" Properly tuned, a thermal-field\n> inducer would couple with metals--- the bodies of robots, for\n> instance, or even the crablike warrior-forms worn by cymeks. Given the\n> correct adjustment, the resonance generator could slam selected metal\n> atoms against each other, generating enormous heat until the machine\n> shook itself apart.\n>\n> The concept seemed promising. Holtzman intended to pursue its\n> development with full enthusiasm and haste.\n>\n> But first he needed more solvers and assistants to construct the\n> prototype. And now he had to waste a day on the mundane task of\n> replacing the\n>\n> household slaves that had died from the fever. With a frustrated sigh,\n> he left his laboratories and trudged down the zigzag trail to the base\n> of the bluffs, where he caught a jetboat across the river.\n>\n> On the opposite shore, at the widest part of the delta, he visited a\n> bustling river market. Rafts and barges had been lashed together for\n> so long that they might well have been part of the landscape. The\n> merchants'quarter was not far from the Starda spaceport, where vendors\n> provided offworld oddities: drugs from Rossak, interesting woods and\n> plants from Ecaz, gems from Hagal, musical instruments from Chusuk.\n>\n> In shops that fronted a narrow alley, tailors were copying the latest\n> Salusan fashions, cutting and sewing exotic imported cloths and fine\n> Poritrin linens. Holtzman had used many of these garment makers to\n> enhance his personal wardrobe. An eminent Savant such as himself could\n> not spend all of his time in the laboratories. After all, he was\n> frequently called upon to make public appearances to answer questions\n> from citizens and often spoke before committees of nobles, to convince\n> them of his continued importance.\n>\n> But today Holtzman made his way farther out onto the floating rafts\n> and barges. He needed to purchase people, not clothes. The scientist\n> saw a sign on the dock ahead, in Galach:HUMAN RESOURCES. He crossed\n> creaking boardwalks and gangplanks to a cluster of rafts that held\n> captives. Grouped in lots behind barricades, the sullen prisoners were\n> dressed in drab, identical uniforms, many of which fit badly. The\n> slaves were lean and angular, as if unaccustomed to eating regular\n> meals. These men and women came from planets that few of the free\n> citizens of Poritrin had ever heard of, much less visited.\n>\n> Their handlers seemed aloof, not particularly eager to show off wares\n> or haggle over prices. After the recent plague, many households and\n> estates needed to replace their personnel, and it was a\n> sellers'market.\n>\n> Other customers crowded against the railings, scrutinizing the\n> downcast faces, inspecting the merchandise. One old man clutching a\n> wad of credits\n>\n> summoned the tender and asked for a closer look at four middle-aged\n> females.\n>\n> Holtzman was not particularly picky, nor did he want to waste time.\n>\n> Since he needed so many slaves, he intended to buy an entire lot. Once\n> they arrived at his blufftop estate, he would choose the most\n> intelligent ones to work calculations, while the remainder would cook,\n> clean, or maintain his household.\n>\n> He hated these menial shopping duties, but had never delegated them in\n> the past. He smiled, realizing he had been critical of Norma for doing\n> the very same thing, for her failure to use solvers.\n>\n> Impatient and eager, Holtzman summoned the nearest handler, waving\n> Niko Bludd's credit authorization and pushing himself to the front. \"I\n> want a large order of slaves.\"\n>\n> The Human Resources merchant bustled over, grinning and bowing. \"Of\n> course, Savant Holtzman! What you require, I shall provide. Simply\n> specify your needs, and I will provide a competitive quotation.\"\n>\n> Suspicious that the merchant might try to cheat him, he said, \"I need\n> slaves that are smart and independent, but capable of following\n> instructions. Seventy or eighty will do, I suppose.\" Some of the\n> customers pushing close to the railing grumbled, but did not challenge\n> the celebrity inventor.\n>\n> \"Quite a demand,\" the vendor said, \"especially in these lean times.\n> The plague has created a shortage, until the Tlulaxa flesh merchants\n> deliver more.\"\n>\n> \"Everyone knows how important--- and *essential*--- my work is,\"\n> Holtzman said, pointedly removing a chronometer from the wide sleeve\n> of his white robe. \"My needs take precedence over some rich citizen\n> looking to replace a house cleaner. If you like, I will obtain a\n> special dispensation from Lord Bludd.\"\n>\n> \"I know you can do that, Savant,\" said the slave tender. He shouted at\n> the other customers pushing forward. \"All of you, quit your\n> complaining! Without this man, we'd be sweeping the floors for\n> thinking machines right now!\" Putting on another face, the handler\n> smiled back at Holtzman. \"The question, of course, is which slaves\n> would best serve you? I have a new batch just delivered from\n> Harmonthep: Zensunnis, all of them. Suitably docile, but I'm afraid\n> they go for a premium.\"\n>\n> Holtzman frowned. He preferred to use his finances in other ways,\n> especially considering the large investment that would be necessary\n> for his new alloy-resonator concept. \"Do not attempt to take advantage\n> of me, sir.\"\n>\n> The man reddened, but held his ground, sensing that the inventor was\n> in a hurry. \"Perhaps another group would be more suitable then? I have\n> some just in from IV Anbus.\" He gestured to a separate raft where\n> dark-haired slaves stared out with hostile expressions, challenging\n> the customers. \"They are Zenshiites.\"\n>\n> \"What's the difference? Are they less expensive?\"\n>\n> \"A simple matter of religious philosophy.\" The slave merchant waited\n> for some recognition, didn't see it, then smiled with relief. \"Who can\n> understand the Buddislamics, anyway? They're workers, and that's what\n> you need, right? I can sell you these Zenshiites for a lower price,\n> even though they're quite intelligent. Probably better educated than\n> the Harmonthep lot. They're healthy, too. I have medical\n> certifications. Not one of them has been exposed to the plague virus.\"\n>\n> Holtzman perused the group. They all had rolled up their left sleeves,\n> as if it were some kind of badge. Up front, a muscular man with fiery\n> eyes and a thick black beard gazed back at him dispassionately, as if\n> he considered himself superior to those who held him captive.\n>\n> With his cursory inspection, Holtzman could see nothing wrong with the\n> IV Anbus captives. His household was desperately understaffed, and his\n> laboratories needed more low-level technicians. Every day it was a\n> struggle\n>\n> to find enough solvers to work through the increasingly complex sets\n> of equations.\n>\n> \"But why are they cheaper?\" he persisted.\n>\n> \"They are more plentiful. It's a simple matter of supply and demand.\"\n> The slave vendor held his gaze. He named a price.\n>\n> Too impatient to haggle for the best deal, Holtzman nodded. \"I'll take\n> eighty of them.\" He raised his voice. \"I don't care if they're from IV\n> Anbus or Harmonthep. They're on Poritrin now, and they work for Savant\n> Tio Holtzman.\"\n>\n> The crafty slave merchant turned to the group of captives and shouted.\n> \"You hear that? You should be proud.\"\n>\n> The dark-haired captives simply looked back at their new master,\n> saying nothing. Holtzman was relieved. That probably meant they would\n> be more tractable.\n>\n> He transferred the correct amount of credits. \"See that they are\n> cleaned up and sent to my residence.\"\n>\n> The grinning slave handler thanked him profusely. \"Don't you worry,\n> Savant Holtzman. You'll be satisfied with this lot.\"\n>\n> As the great man left the crowded river market, other customers began\n> to shout and wave their credit vouchers, squabbling over the remaining\n> slaves. It promised to be a furious day of bidding.\n\n*Over the course of history, the stronger species invariably wins.*\n\n--- TLALOC,\n\n*A Time for Titans*\n\n> **A**fter taking refuge in the Arrakis wasteland, the Zensunni\n> Wanderers were little more than scavengers, and not very brave. Even\n> on their most distant excursions to collect useful items, the nomads\n> remained close to the rocks, avoiding the deep desert and the demon\n> worms.\n>\n> Long ago, after the Imperial chemist Shakkad the Wise had remarked on\n> the rejuvenating properties of the obscure spice melange, there had\n> been a small market for the natural substance among offworlders at the\n> Arrakis City spaceport. However, the planet's distance from popular\n> spacing lanes had never made melange an economically attractive item.\n> \"An oddity, not a commodity,\" one surly merchant had told Naib\n> Dhartha. Still, spice was a staple in the food supply, and it must be\n> gathered . . . but only on sands close to the rocks.\n>\n> Dhartha led a party of six across a ridge of packed powder sand that\n> held their footprints as if they were kisses in the dust. Loose white\n> cloths around their heads and faces exposed only their eyes; their\n> cloaks blew in the breeze, revealing equipment belts, tools, and\n> weapons. Dhartha snugged the cloth higher over his nose to keep from\n> breathing grit. He scratched the tattoo etched so painstakingly onto\n> his cheek, then narrowed his eyes, always alert for danger.\n>\n> No one thought to watch the clear morning skies until they heard a\n> faint whistle growing quickly into a howl. To Naib Dhartha, it sounded\n> like a woman who had just learned of her husband's death.\n>\n> Looking up, he saw a silvery bullet that tore through the atmosphere,\n> then recognized the unexpected hum and whine of thrusters. A\n> bubble-shaped object plummeted through the sky, spun about and\n> see-sawed in the open air as if choosing a place to land. Quad engines\n> slowed its descent. Then, less\n>\n> than a kilometer from where the scavenging party stood, the object\n> slammed into the dunes like a fist thumping into the stomach of a\n> dishonest merchant. A spray of dust and sand shot upward, embracing a\n> tendril of dark soot.\n>\n> The Naib stood stiffly and stared, while his men began to jabber\n> excitedly. Young Ebrahim was as enthralled as Dhartha's own son,\n> Mahmad; both boys wanted to race out and investigate.\n>\n> Mahmad was a good lad, respectful and cautious. But Dhartha had a low\n> opinion of Ebrahim, who liked to tell stories and talk of imaginary\n> exploits. Then there was the incident in which tribal water had been\n> stolen, an unforgivable crime. Initially the Naib had thought two boys\n> were involved, Ebrahim and Selim. But Ebrahim had been quick to\n> disavow any responsibility and to point the finger at the other boy.\n> Selim had seemed shocked at the accusation, but had not denied it.\n>\n> In addition, Ebrahim's father had stepped forward to make a generous\n> deal with Dhartha to save his son . . . and so the orphan boy had\n> received the ultimate sentence of banishment. Not much of a loss to\n> the tribe. A Naib often had to make such difficult decisions.\n>\n> Now, as the scavengers looked at Dhartha, their bright eyes glinting\n> between folds of dirty white cloth, he knew he could not ignore the\n> opportunity of this crashed ship, whatever it was. \"We must go see\n> this thing,\" he called.\n>\n> His men rushed across the sands, boisterous Ebrahim and Mahmad in the\n> lead, hurrying toward the pillar of dust that marked the impact.\n> Dhartha did not like to stray far from the sheltering rock, but the\n> desert beckoned them toward a rich, alien treasure.\n>\n> The nomads crested one dune, slid down the slipface, and scurried up\n> another. By the time they reached the impact crater, they were all\n> winded, panting hot breaths that were smothered by the cloths over\n> their mouths. The Naib and his men stood on the high lip of excavated\n> sand. Glassy smears of superheated silica had splattered like saliva\n> on the ground.\n>\n> Inside the pit lay a mechanical object the size of two men, with\n> protrusions and components that hummed and moved, awakening now that\n> it had landed. The carbon fiber-encased body still smoked from the\n> heat of reentry. A spacecraft, perhaps?\n>\n> One of Dhartha's men stepped back, making a warding sign with his\n> fingers. Overzealous Ebrahim, though, bent forward. The Naib put a\n> hand on Mahmad's left arm, cautioning his son. Let the foolish one\n> take the risks.\n>\n> The crashed pod was too small to carry passengers. The lights blinked\n> brighter, and the probe's sides opened like dragon wings to expose\n> mechanical limbs, articulated claws, and complex machinery inside.\n> Scanners, processors, engines of investigation and destruction.\n> Mirrorlike power converters spread out in the glare of the sun.\n>\n> Ebrahim slid down the churned sand at the edge of the pit. \"Imagine\n> what this would be worth at the spaceport, Naib! If I get to it first,\n> I should receive the largest salvage share.\"\n>\n> Dhartha wanted to argue with the exuberant youth, but when he saw that\n> no one--- except for his own son--- looked eager to join Ebrahim, he\n> nodded. \"If successful, you'll get an extra share.\" Even if the\n> falling object was completely ruined, the nomads could work the pure\n> metal for their own purposes.\n>\n> The brash young man stopped halfway down the loose slope, looking\n> suspiciously at the device, which continued to vibrate and thump.\n> Flexible components extruded arms and legs, while strange lenses and\n> mirrors rotated at the ends of flexible carbon fiber tentacles. The\n> probe seemed to be assessing its surroundings, as if it didn't\n> comprehend where it had landed.\n>\n> The machine paid no attention to the surreptitious humans, until\n> Ebrahim dug a stone from the slumping side of the crater. He called\n> out \"Ai! Ai!\" then hurled the rock. It struck the composite material\n> of the probe's side with an echoing *clunk*.\n>\n> The mechanical lander froze, then turned its lenses and scanners\n> toward the human standing all alone. Ebrahim hunched on bent knees in\n> the yielding sand.\n>\n> Blinding hot light erupted from one of the lenses. A gout of coherent\n> fire engulfed Ebrahim and blew him backward in a crackling cloud of\n> incinerated flesh and bones. A wad of smoldering garments struck the\n> top of the crater, along with charred pieces of his hands and feet.\n>\n> Mahmad screamed for his friend, and Dhartha immediately yelled for the\n> men to retreat. They stumbled back down the outside of the crater and\n> fled through the soft gully between dunes. Half a kilometer away,\n> safe, they climbed to a sandy crest high enough that they could look\n> back toward the pit. The men prayed and made superstitious gestures,\n> and Dhartha raised his clenched right fist. Foolish Ebrahim had drawn\n> the attention of the mechanical thing and had paid with his life.\n>\n> From a distance, the would-be scavengers watched. The crashed probe\n> paid them no further heed. Instead, with thumping and clattering, the\n> machine seemed to be assembling itself, building structures around its\n> core. Scooping hands drew sand into a resource-production hopper in\n> its belly and extruded glasslike rods that it used for structural\n> supports. The machine added new components, building itself larger,\n> and finally began digging its way out of the pit. It pounded and\n> hammered, making a great deal of racket.\n>\n> Dhartha remained perplexed. Though he was a leader, he had no idea\n> what to do. Such a thing was beyond his ken. Perhaps someone at the\n> spaceport would know, but he hated to rely on outworlders. Besides,\n> this thing might be valuable, and he didn't want to surrender his\n> salvage.\n>\n> \"Father, look.\" Mahmad gestured toward the wasteland of sand. \"See,\n> that machine demon will pay for killing my friend.\"\n>\n> Dhartha saw the telltale ripple, the stirring of a behemoth beneath\n> the sands. The crashed probe continued its pounding, rhythmic motion\n> with a clattering of components, oblivious to its surroundings. The\n> assembled mechanism raised itself, a monstrous composite of\n> crystalline materials and\n>\n> silica struts reinforced by carbon-fiber beams converted from its own\n> hull and support girders.\n>\n> The sandworm came in fast, tunneling just beneath the surface until\n> its head rose up. The mouth was a huge shovel larger than the impact\n> crater.\n>\n> The robotic probe waved its sensor arms and weapons lenses, sensing it\n> was being attacked, but not understanding how. Several white-hot\n> blasts of fire penetrated the loose ground.\n>\n> The worm swallowed the mechanical demon whole. Then the sinuous desert\n> creature burrowed beneath the dust again like a sea serpent seeking\n> deeper waters. . . .\n>\n> Naib Dhartha and his men remained petrified on the dunes. If they\n> turned and ran now, their vibrations would call the sandworm back for\n> another meal.\n>\n> Soon enough, they saw the worm trail heading outward, returning to the\n> deep desert. The crater was gone, along with all evidence of the\n> mechanical construction. Not even a scrap of foolish Ebrahim's body\n> remained.\n>\n> Shaking his head with its long black ponytail, Dhartha turned to his\n> shocked companions. \"This will make a legendary story, a magnificent\n> ballad to be sung in our caves in the dark of night. . . .\" He drew a\n> deepbreath and turned around. \"Though I doubt anyone will ever believe\n> us.\"\n>\n> *The future?

Because of the slow pace caused by the damage,\n> Seurat had immediately dispatched his emergency buoy, relaying to\n> Omnius the dire news of the fall of the newest Synchronized World and\n> the loss of the Titan Barbarossa. By now the evermind must know what\n> had happened.\n>\n> The robot captain did his best to repair or bypass the ship's damaged\n> systems and seal off sections to protect his fragile human copilot.\n> General Agamemnon would not be pleased if his biological son were\n> injured. Besides, Seurat had developed a certain fondness for Vorian\n> Atreides. . . .\n>\n> Vor insisted on donning an environment suit and crawling outside the\n> update ship to inspect the hull. Seurat tethered him with two lines,\n> while three inspector drones accompanied him. When the young man saw\n> the blackened wound where the rebellious humans had fired upon them,\n> he once again felt a sense of shame. Intent only on delivering the\n> vital Omnius updates, Seurat had committed no aggressive act against\n> these *hrethgir*, yet they had attacked him. Wild humans were without\n> honor.\n>\n> Agamemnon and his friend Barbarossa had brought the unruly populace of\n> Giedi Prime into the sweeping embrace of Omnius, yet the *hrethgir*\n> had spurned the greater civilization of the Synchronized Worlds,\n> making a martyr of Barbarossa in the process. His father would be\n> deeply disturbed at the loss of such a close friend, one of the last\n> remaining Titans.\n>\n> Vor himself could have been killed, his soft and breakable human form\n> destroyed without ever having the chance to become a neo-cymek. A\n> single blow from the Armada could have erased all of Vor's potential,\n> all of his future work. He could not update himself or back up his\n> memories and\n>\n> experiences, as a machine could. He'd be lost, just like the Giedi\n> Prime-- Omnius. Just like the other twelve sons of Agamemnon. The\n> thought sickened him, and he shuddered.\n>\n> On their return journey, Seurat tried to cheer Vor with ridiculous\n> jokes, as if nothing had happened. The robot commended his companion\n> for quick thinking and tactical innovation in outwitting the\n> *hrethgir* officer. Vor's deceit in pretending to be a rebellious\n> human who had captured a thinking-machine vessel--- what an outr\u00e9\n> scenario!--- had given them a few moments of valuable time, and his\n> decoy projections had allowed them to escape. Perhaps it would even be\n> taught to others in the trustee schools on Earth.\n>\n> Vor, however, cared most about what his father might say. The approval\n> of the great Agamemnon would make everything all right.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WHEN THE *DREAM VOYAGER* landed at Earth's central spaceport, Vorian\n> hurried down the ramp, eyes alert, face eager--- then crestfallen when\n> he saw no sign of the Titan general.\n>\n> Vor swallowed hard. Unless vital matters intervened, his father always\n> came to greet him. These were rare moments they had together, when\n> they could exchange ideas, talk about plans and dreams. Vor comforted\n> himself with the thought that Agamemnon probably had important\n> business for Omnius.\n>\n> Robotic maintenance crews and repair machinery trundled forward to\n> inspect the damaged ship. One of the multicomponent machines paused in\n> its assessment, broke away, and hummed toward him. \"Vorian Atreides,\n> Agamemnon has commanded you to meet him in the conditioning facility.\n> Report there immediately.\"\n>\n> The young human brightened. Letting the robot return to its work, he\n> walked off briskly. When he could contain himself no longer, he began\n> to run. . . .\n>\n> Though he attempted to exercise during the long voyages with Seurat,\n> Vor's biological muscles were weaker than a machine's, and he tired\n> quickly. Another reminder of his mortality, his fragility, and the\n> inferiority of natural biology. It only increased his desire to wear a\n> powerful neo-cymek body someday and discard this imperfect human form.\n>\n> His lungs burning, Vor rushed into the gleaming chrome-and-plaz\n> chamber where his father's brain canister was regularly polished and\n> recharged with electrafluid. As soon as the young man entered the\n> cold, well-lit room, two robot guards folded in behind him, ominously\n> blocking egress. In the center of the chamber stood a mechanical,\n> human-shaped colossus that Agamemnon now wore. The behemoth took two\n> steps forward, stabilizer-feet hammering against the hard floor. He\n> dwarfed his son, towering three times Vorian's height.\n>\n> \"I have been waiting for you, my son. Everything is prepared. What\n> caused your delay?\"\n>\n> Intimidated, Vor looked up at the preservation canister. \"I hurried\n> here, Father. My ship landed only an hour ago.\"\n>\n> \"I understand the *Dream Voyager* was damaged at Giedi Prime, attacked\n> by the human rebels that murdered Barbarossa and recaptured the\n> world.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, sir.\" Vor knew better than to waste the Titan's time with\n> unnecessary details. The general would already have received a full\n> report. \"I will answer any questions you might have, Father.\"\n>\n> \"I have no questions, only *commands*.\" Instead of instructing his son\n> to begin the process of grooming and polishing his components,\n> Agamemnon raised a gauntleted hand, clutched Vorian by the chest, and\n> pushed him forcefully against an upright table.\n>\n> Vor was slammed against the smooth surface and felt a burst of pain.\n> His father was so powerful that he could accidentally break bones,\n> sever the spine. \"What is it, Father? What---\"\n>\n> Holding him immobile, Agamemnon clamped on wrist bindings, a waist\n> restraint, and ankle cuffs. Helpless now, Vor twisted his head to look\n> at what his father was doing and saw that complex devices had been\n> brought into the chamber. With trepidation he noted hollow cylinders\n> filled with bluish fluids, neuromechanical pumps, and chittering\n> machines that waved questing sensor tips in the air.\n>\n> \"Please, Father.\" Vor's deepest fears careened through his mind,\n> ricocheting off the pain, each impact increasing his doubts and\n> terrors. \"What have I done wrong?\"\n>\n> Showing no readable expression on his head turret, Agamemnon extended\n> an array of long needles toward his son's squirming body. The steel\n> points penetrated his chest, poking between his ribs, seeking out and\n> finding his lungs, his heart. Two silver shafts pierced his throat.\n> Blood oozed out everywhere. Vor's neck sinews bulged as he clenched\n> his jaw and curled back his lips, biting back a scream.\n>\n> But the scream broke through anyway.\n>\n> The cymek manipulated the machinery connected to Vorian's body,\n> increasing the pain beyond all imaginable levels. Convinced that he\n> had failed somehow, Vor assumed it was his time to die--- like the\n> twelve unknown brothers who had preceded him. Now, it seemed, Vorian\n> had not lived up to Agamemnon's expectations.\n>\n> Agony swelled higher, with no crest in sight. His scream became a\n> prolonged wail, as acid-colored fluids were pumped into his body. Soon\n> even his vocal cords gave out, and his shriek continued only in his\n> mind . . .\n>\n> yet it continued nevertheless. He could endure no more. He could not\n> imagine the grievous injury his stretched and torn body must already\n> have endured.\n>\n> When finally the torture concluded and Vor came back to himself, he\n> didn't know how long he had been unconscious--- perhaps even lost in\n> the cloak of death. His body felt as if it had been crushed into a\n> ball and then stretched back into the form of a man.\n>\n> The colossus shape of Agamemnon loomed over him, a galaxy of optic\n> threads glittering on his body. Even though the remnants of\n> excruciating pain echoed inside his skull, Vor resisted crying out.\n> His father had kept him alive after all, for his own reasons. He\n> stared into the Titan's implacable metal face and could only hope that\n> his father had not revived him just to inflict more agony.\n>\n> *What have I done wrong?*\n>\n> Yet the ancient cymek did not have murder on his mind. Instead he\n> said, \"I am exceedingly pleased with your actions aboard the *Dream\n> Voyager*, Vorian. I have analyzed Seurat's report and determined that\n> your tactical prowess in escaping from the League Armada was\n> innovative and unexpected.\"\n>\n> Vorian couldn't understand the context of his father's words. They\n> seemed unrelated to the tortures the general had inflicted on him.\n>\n> \"No thinking machine would have considered such a deceitful trick. I\n> doubt even another trustee would have been so quick to think of the\n> ruse. In fact, Omnius's summation concludes that any other action\n> would likely have resulted in the capture or destruction of the *Dream\n> Voyager*. Seurat would never have been capable of surviving by\n> himself. You not only saved the ship, you saved the Omnius update\n> spheres and returned them intact.\" Agamemnon paused, then reiterated.\n> \"Yes, I am exceedingly pleased, my son. You have the potential of\n> becoming a great cymek someday.\"\n>\n> Vor's raw throat convulsed as he tried to force out words. The\n> needle-studded cradle had been yanked away, and now Agamemnon released\n> the body restraints that held him against the hard surface. Vorian's\n> watery muscles could not support him, and he drooped like a rag,\n> sliding down until he pooled on his knees on the floor. Finally he\n> choked, \"Then why was I tortured? Why have you punished me?\"\n>\n> Agamemnon simulated a laugh. \"When I choose to punish you, son, you\n> will know. That was a *reward*. Omnius allowed me to grant you this\n> rare\n>\n> gift. In fact, no other human in all the Synchronized Worlds has been\n> so honored.\"\n>\n> \"But how, Father? Please explain it to me. My mind is still\n> throbbing.\" His voice hitched.\n>\n> \"What are a few moments of pain, in comparison with the gift you have\n> received?\" The colossus paced back and forth across the sparkling\n> maintenance room, shaking the floor and the walls. \"Unfortunately, I\n> was unable to convince Omnius to convert you into a neo-cymek--- you\n> are too young--- but I am sure the time will come. I wanted you to\n> serve at my side\n>\n> --- more than a trustee, but as my true successor.\" His sparkling\n> optic threads glowed brighter. \"Instead, I have done the next best\n> thing for you.\"\n>\n> The cymek general explained that he had given Vorian a rigorous\n> biotech treatment, a cellular replacement system that would\n> dramatically extend his life as a human. \"Geriatric specialists\n> developed the technique in the Old Empire . . . though to what purpose\n> I cannot fathom. Those oafs did nothing productive during their normal\n> lifespans, so why should they want to live for centuries longer and\n> accomplish even less? Through new proteins, rejection of free\n> radicals, more efficient cellular repair mechanisms, they prolonged\n> their pointless existences. Most of them were murdered in the\n> rebellions when we Titans cemented our control.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon swiveled at his torso joint. \"While we still wore human\n> bodies at the beginning of our rule, all twenty Titans underwent the\n> biotech life extension, just like you, so I am quite familiar with the\n> level of pain you endured. We *needed* to live for centuries, because\n> we required that much time to reassert vision and competent leadership\n> upon the waning Old Empire. Even after we converted ourselves into\n> cymeks, the process helped prevent our ancient biological brains from\n> degenerating because of our extreme age.\"\n>\n> His mechanical body strode closer. \"This life-extension process is our\n> little secret, Vorian. The League of Nobles would tear themselves into\n> a frenzy if they knew we had such technology.\" Agamemnon made a\n> wistful sound,\n>\n> almost a sigh. \"But beware, my son: Even such enhancements cannot\n> protect you against accidents or outright assassination attempts. As,\n> unfortunately, Barbarossa recently discovered.\"\n>\n> Vor finally struggled shakily to his feet. He located a water\n> dispenser, gulped a beaker of cool liquid, and felt his heartbeat\n> slowing.\n>\n> \"Astonishing events await you, my son. Your life is no longer a candle\n> in the wind. You have time to experience many things, important\n> things.\"\n>\n> The hulking cymek stalked over to a harness and used an intricate\n> network of artificial hands and clamps extruded from the metal wall to\n> link to the thoughtrodes of his brain canister. Flexible lifting arms\n> raised the cylinder out of the colossus body core and shuttled it over\n> to one of the chrome pedestals.\n>\n> \"Now you are one step closer to your potential, Vorian,\" Agamemnon\n> said through a wall speaker, detached from the mobile body.\n>\n> Though weak and still in pain, Vor knew what his father expected of\n> him now. He hurried to the conditioning devices and with trembling\n> hands attached power cables to the magsockets of the translucent brain\n> chamber. The bluish electrafluid seemed full of mental energy.\n>\n> Trying to restore a sense of normalcy amid the clamoring disbelief at\n> what had just happened to him, Vor went through his habitual grooming\n> duties, tending his father's mechanical systems. Lovingly, the young\n> man gazed at the wrinkled mass of brain, the ancient mind so full of\n> profound ideas and difficult decisions, as expressed in the general's\n> extensive memoirs. Each time he read them, Vor hoped to understand his\n> complex father better.\n>\n> He wondered if Agamemnon had kept him in the dark to play a cruel joke\n> on him, or to challenge his resolve. Vor would always accept whatever\n> the cymek general commanded, would never try to flee. Now that the\n> agony was over, he hoped he had passed whatever test his father had\n> administered.\n>\n> As Vor continued the patient grooming of the preservation tank,\n> Agamemnon spoke softly, a susurration. \"You are very quiet, my son.\n> What do you think about the great gift you have received?\"\n>\n> The young man paused a moment, not certain how to respond. Agamemnon\n> was often impulsive and difficult to understand, but he rarely acted\n> without a larger purpose in mind. Vor could only hope to comprehend\n> the overall picture someday, the grand tapestry.\n>\n> \"Thank you, Father,\" he finally said, \"for giving me more time to\n> accomplish everything you want me to do.\"\n>\n> *Why do humans spend so much time worrying about what they call \"moral\n> issues\"? It is one of the many mysteries of their behavior.*\n\n--- ERASMUS,\n\n*Reflections on Sentient Biologicals*\n\n> **T**he identical twin girls looked peaceful and asleep, side by side,\n> like little angels in a cozy bed.

Humans were full of\n> differences and surprises, but as a species they behaved according to\n> general rules. Under certain conditions, especially when crowded into\n> confined spaces, people reacted with a pack mentality, blindly\n> following others, eschewing individuality.\n>\n> Sometimes humans were valiant; sometimes they were cowards. It\n> especially intrigued Erasmus to see what happened when he conducted\n> \"panic experiments\" on crowds of them in the breeding pens, wading in\n> and butchering some while letting others survive. In such\n> circumstances of extreme stress, leaders invariably emerged, people\n> who behaved with more inner strength than the others. Erasmus\n> especially liked to kill those individuals and then watch the\n> devastating effect it had on the rest of the people.\n>\n> Perhaps his sample group of experimental subjects over the centuries\n> was too small. He might need to vivisect and dissect tens of thousands\n> more before he could draw meaningful conclusions. A monumental task,\n> but as a machine Erasmus had no limitations on energy, or patience.\n>\n> With one of his personal probes, he touched the cheek of the larger of\n> the two girls and sensed her steady pulse.

The fibrous probe glided\n> back into access channels in his composite skin, but not before he\n> intentionally, petulantly, scratched her skin.\n>\n> When the independent robot had taken these identical twins from the\n> worker pens, their mother had cursed at him and called him a monster.\n> Humans could be so parochial, failing to see the importance of what he\n> was doing, the larger picture.\n>\n> With a self-cauterizing scalpel-beam, he cut into the cerebellum of\n> the smaller girl (who was 1.09 centimeters shorter and 0.7 kilograms\n> lighter--- therefore, not \"identical\" at all), and watched the brain\n> activity of her\n>\n> drugged sister go wild--- a sympathetic reaction. Fascinating. But the\n> girls were not physically connected to each other, not through body\n> contact nor by machine. Could they sense one another's pain?\n>\n> He chided himself for his lack of foresight and planning. *I should\n> have put the mother on the same table.*\n>\n> His thoughts were interrupted by Omnius, who spoke from the nearest\n> wallscreen. \"Your new female slave has arrived, a last gift from the\n> Titan Barbarossa. She awaits you in the sitting room.\"\n>\n> Erasmus raised his bloody metal hands. He had looked forward to\n> receiving the woman captured from Giedi Prime, supposedly the daughter\n> of the League Viceroy.

A wasted opportunity.\n>\n> \"Analyzing docile slaves gives you irrelevant results, Erasmus. All\n> thoughts of revolt have been bred out of them. Therefore, any\n> information you derive is of questionable applicability for military\n> purposes.\" The evermind's voice boomed from the wallscreen.\n>\n> Erasmus soaked his organic-plastic hands in solvent to eliminate the\n> drying blood. He had access to thousands of years of human-compiled\n> psychological studies, but even with so much data it was not possible\n> to create a clear answer. Many self-proclaimed \"experts\" offered\n> wildly disparate answers.\n>\n> On the table, the surviving twin continued to mewl her pain and fear.\n> \"I disagree, Omnius. The human creature is innately rebellious. The\n> trait is inherent in their species. Slaves will never be entirely\n> loyal to us, no matter\n>\n> how many generations they have served.

It is a fundamental flaw in their biological\n> programming. Would that not be useful information?\"\n>\n> \"Yes.

Zufa Cenva had\n> never adhered to any graceful social skills, and Norma had developed\n> few of her own. She had grown up isolated on Rossak and been dismissed\n> by most of those who knew her--- with the exception of Aurelius\n> Venport.\n>\n> Holtzman seemed to have an agenda beyond what he preached. But he was\n> a scientist, after all, and she felt they had been brought together\n> for an important purpose. It was her duty to point out when she felt\n> he was making an error. He would have done the same for her. \"I still\n> think you shouldn't devote any further time or resources to the\n> resonance-generator project.\"\n>\n> \"Since the resources are mine to distribute as I see fit,\" Holtzman\n> said in a huff, \"I will continue, and hope to prove you wrong.\" He\n> left her chamber, grumbling.\n>\n> She called after him in an attempt to ease the situation. \"Believe me,\n> Savant, I hope you prove me wrong.\"\n>\n> *There is a certain malevolence about the formation of social orders,\n> a profound struggle, with despotism on one end and slavery on the\n> other.*\n\n--- TLALOC,\n\n*Weaknesses of the Empire*\n\n> **P**oritrin's river delta was not at all like Harmonthep's gentle\n> rivulets and marshes.

Ishmael longed for the\n> taste of fish baked in lily leaves and of sweet reeds whose juices\n> could make a boy drunk with delight.\n>\n> At night, half of the communal dwellings were vacant because so many\n> slaves had died from the fever. Ishmael often crawled to his pallet\n> and fell deeply asleep. Other times, he forced himself to remain awake\n> and sit in the storytelling circles.\n>\n> The men talked among themselves, debating whether to select a new\n> leader for their group. To some of them, the concept seemed pointless.\n> There could be no escape, and a leader could only inspire them to take\n> chances that would get them all killed. Ishmael felt sad, remembering\n> how his grandfather had expected to name a successor one day. Yet the\n> Tlulaxa flesh merchants had changed all of that. Unable to reach a\n> decision, the Zensunni men talked on and on. It made Ishmael want to\n> drift off to the oblivion of sleep.\n>\n> He liked it better when the men told old stories, reciting the poetic\n> \"Songs of the Long Trek\" about the Zensunni Wanderings, how his people\n> had sought a home where they would be safe from both the thinking\n> machines and the League Worlds. Ishmael had never seen a robot and\n> wondered if they were only imaginary monsters to frighten disobedient\n> children. But he had indeed seen evil men--- the raiders who had\n> decimated his quiet village, mistreated his grandfather, taken so many\n> innocents captive.\n>\n> Sitting at the edge of the firelight, Ishmael listened to the tales of\n> his people. The Zensunni were accustomed to tribulations, and they\n> might have to tolerate even generations of slavery on this planet so\n> far from home. No matter the challenge, his people knew how to endure.\n>\n> Of all the stories the boy had heard, the covenants and prophecies, he\n> clung to one above all the others: the promise that the misery would\n> one day end.\n>\n> *There is no clear division between Gods and Men--- one blends softly\n> casual into the other.*\n>\n> --- IBLIS GINJO,\n\n*Options for Total Liberation*\n\n> **T**he ornate pedestal for the statue of the Titan Ajax was nearly\n> complete. Crew master Iblis Ginjo perused the daily tally and\n> production requirements on his electronic notepad. He had made his\n> slaves understand their very real danger, should the brutal cymek lose\n> patience. They worked very hard, not just for fear of their lives, but\n> because Iblis had inspired them.\n>\n> Then, a disaster occurred on another part of the project.\n>\n> With the heat of day rising around the observation scaffold where\n> Iblis stood supervising the stabilization of the sturdy pedestal, in\n> the distance he saw the top of the nearly completed Ajax statue begin\n> to move. The iron, polymer, and stone colossus tottered one way and\n> then the other, as if gravity itself were shaking the enormous work of\n> art.\n>\n> Suddenly the giant monument toppled with a crashing roar, accompanied\n> by distant shouts and screams. As a cloud of dust climbed into the\n> sky, Iblis knew that any slave who had been crushed under the massive\n> statue should be considered lucky.\n>\n> Once Ajax learned of the catastrophe, the real mayhem would begin.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> EVEN BEFORE THE dust and rubble settled, Iblis rushed into the furious\n> debate among neo-cymeks and his fellow trustee crew leaders. It hadn't\n> been his part of the monument project that had collapsed, but his\n> teams would suffer in the inevitable delays caused by the accident.\n> Still, Iblis hoped his charismatic mediation skills could help\n> mitigate the disaster.\n>\n> Enraged neo-cymeks saw the clumsy damage as a personal affront to\n> their revered Titan predecessors. Ajax himself had already torn a work\n> supervisor limb from limb, and gory body parts lay scattered and\n> dripping in the dust.\n>\n> With all the compelling passion he could summon, Iblis Ginjo made the\n> angry neo-cymeks pause. \"Wait, wait! This can be fixed, if you will\n> allow me!\"\n>\n> Ajax rose taller, more threatening than any of the neo-cymeks, but\n> Iblis continued, his words silky. \"True, the enormous statue has\n> suffered some harm, but nothing more than superficial blemishes. Lord\n> Ajax, this monument was designed to endure throughout the ages!\n> Certainly it can endure a few bumps and scratches. Your grand legacy\n> is not so easily bruised.\"\n>\n> He paused as the cymeks were forced to admit the truth of this. Then\n> he pointed toward his own work area and continued in a reasonable\n> tone, \"Look, my crews have nearly finished the sturdy pedestal\n> designed to hold up the statue. Why don't we erect it anyway, to show\n> the universe that we can brush aside minor annoyances like this\n> accident? My workers can perform all the necessary repairs in place.\"\n> Iblis's eyes shone with artificial enthusiasm. \"There is no reason for\n> further delay.\"\n>\n> Pacing about the carnage and confusion in his menacing armored body,\n> Ajax stomped on one of the crew leaders who was babbling his\n> innocence, pulping him into the ground. Then the angry Titan towered\n> over Iblis, optic threads glowing like white-hot stars. \"You have now\n> accepted responsibility to see that work continues according to\n> schedule. If your teams fail, the blame will be yours.\"\n>\n> \"Of course, Lord Ajax.\" Iblis showed no alarm at all. He could\n> convince the slaves to carry the burden. They would do it for him.\n>\n> \"Then get this mess cleaned up!\" Ajax thundered in a voice that could\n> be heard across the hilltop Forum.\n>\n> Later, Iblis made promises to his already-exhausted, overtaxed slaves.\n> They had been discontented and resistant for a while, but he won them\n> over with a stirring account of the wondrous benefits they would\n> receive: the finest sex slaves, incredible feasts, days of leisure to\n> journey about the countryside. \"I am not like other trustees. Have I\n> ever let you down? Ever promised a reward that I failed to deliver?\"\n>\n> With such an incentive, not to mention a healthy dose of fear for the\n> Titan Ajax, the laborers set to the task with redoubled energy. In the\n> coolness of the evening, with hovering spotlights glaring like\n> super-novas over the construction site, Iblis kept his crew working\n> efficiently. From his high wooden platform, he watched as the slaves\n> raised the immense statue on its sturdy reinforced pedestal and\n> plasma-bolted it into place.\n>\n> Artisans rushed forward and scaled the curved stone-and-iron surface\n> with climbing equipment, and set up swaying temporary scaffolds to\n> begin their restoration work. Ajax's legendary face had a marred nose\n> and one dented muscular arm, as well as deep gouges across the front\n> of the Titan uniform. In his secret heart, Iblis suspected the real\n> Ajax's human form had been lumpish and ugly.\n>\n> Throughout the long, tiresome night, Iblis struggled to stay awake,\n> leaning against the rail and peering into the blurring abyss. He dozed\n> off, then awoke, startled, as he heard the smooth hum of the lift\n> platform rising to his level.\n>\n> But he was mystified to see that the lift bore no one at all. Only a\n> small sheet of rolled-up metal, a message cylinder. Iblis stared, his\n> heart pounding, but the lift remained at his level, as if waiting. He\n> looked over the edge, but could not determine who had left the\n> message.\n>\n> *How could he ignore it?*\n>\n> Iblis stole forward and grabbed the scrap of scribed metal. He broke\n> the seal, unrolled the thin sheet, and read with increasing\n> astonishment.\n>\n> \"We represent an organized movement of dissatisfied humans. We are\n> waiting for the right moment and the right leader to begin an open\n> revolt against the oppressive machines. You must determine if you wish\n> to join our worthy cause. We will contact you again.\"\n>\n> As Iblis stared in disbelief at the unsigned message, the lettering\n> faded and disappeared, corroding into blobs of rust that ate through\n> the metal itself and flaked away.\n>\n> Was it authentic, or some sort of a cymek trap designed to lure him?\n> Most humans hated their machine masters, but took pains to conceal it.\n> *What if there really is such a group?* And if so, they would need\n> talented leaders.\n>\n> The thought exhilarated him. Iblis had never considered such an idea\n> before, and he couldn't imagine what he had said or done to reveal his\n> innermost thoughts and feelings. Why did they suspect? He had always\n> been respectful to his superiors, had always---\n>\n> *But have I been overly attentive? Have I tried too hard to appear\n> loyal?*\n>\n> On the towering Ajax statue, just below his own level, the artisans\n> remained hard at work like busy termites on a log. They repaired\n> scrape marks, expertly patched and painted the marred exterior. Dawn\n> broke across the monumental statue, and Iblis could see they would be\n> finished soon. The machines would reward him for his labors.\n>\n> How he hated them!\n>\n> Iblis wrestled with his conscience. The thinking machines had treated\n> him well in comparison with other slaves, but only a thin layer of\n> protection kept him from the same fate. In his private moments Iblis\n> often pondered the value of freedom, and what he could do if given the\n> chance.\n>\n> A rebel group? He could barely believe it. As days went by, Iblis\n> found himself thinking about it more and more . . . and waiting to be\n> contacted again.\n\n> *Our appetite encompasses everything.*\n\n--- COGITOR EKLO,\n\n*Beyond the Human Mind*\n\n> **W**ith all the hatred concealed inside his mind, Agamemnon took\n> special precautions wherever Omnius could spy on him. This meant\n> almost always, and almost everywhere--- even when Agamemnon and Juno\n> had passionate sex. Or at least what passed for sex among the Titans.\n>\n> For their tryst, walker bodies brought the two ancient cymeks into a\n> maintenance chamber within the control pavilion on Earth. Around them,\n> tubes of nutrient liquids snaked toward storage tanks in the ceiling.\n> Robotic tenders moved from life-support generators to analysis banks,\n> skimming data from thoughtrodes, ensuring that all systems remained\n> within normal parameters.\n>\n> Agamemnon and Juno conversed with each other on a private short-range\n> band, twitching their respective sensors and sparking each other's\n> thoughtrodes through the electrafluid. *Foreplay*. Even without\n> physical bodies, the cymek minds could still experience intense\n> pleasure.\n>\n> Automated lifters disengaged his preservation canister smoothly from\n> its walking body, then set the thinking core on a clean chrome\n> pedestal beside the container that held Juno's pinkish gray brain.\n> With the accessible optic threads and computer comparison grids, he\n> recognized the distinctive folds and lobes of his lover's mind. *Still\n> beautiful after all these centuries*.\n>\n> Agamemnon remembered how lovely she had been back in the beginning:\n> obsidian-black hair that shimmered with blue highlights. Her nose had\n> been pointed, her face narrow, with eyebrows that arched in a\n> mysterious way. He always thought of her as Cleopatra, another\n> military genius from the mists of history, just like the first\n> Agamemnon in the Trojan War.\n>\n> Long ago, during the eyeblink of time when he had worn a frail human\n> physique, Agamemnon had fallen in love with this woman. Though Juno\n> was extremely desirable sexually, he had been attracted to her mind\n> before ever meeting her in person. He had first become aware of her on\n> a complex virtual network through tactical simulations and wargames he\n> had fought with her on the Old Empire's docile computers. The two of\n> them had been teenagers then, back when age mattered.\n>\n> As a boy, Agamemnon had been raised on pampered Earth, with the name\n> of Andrew Skouros. His parents had led a hedonistic but passionless\n> lifestyle, as had so many other citizens. They existed, they dabbled .\n> . . but none of them really *lived*. Across the depths of time, he\n> barely remembered the faces of his parents. All weak and feeble humans\n> looked the same to him now.\n>\n> Andrew Skouros had always been restless. He had asked uncomfortable\n> questions that no one could answer. While the others played frivolous\n> parlor games, the young man dug into archival databases, where he\n> uncovered history and legends. He found heroic tales of real people\n> who had existed so long ago they seemed as mythical as the race of\n> Titans, the earliest gods overthrown by Zeus and a pantheon of Greek\n> deities. He analyzed military conquests and came to understand tactics\n> at a time when it was an obsolete skill in the peace-strangled Empire.\n>\n> Under the alias \"Agamemnon,\" he became interested in strategic games\n> played across the computer network that monitored the activities of\n> ennui-enslaved humanity. There he had encountered another person as\n> skilled and talented as himself, a rare soulmate who shared his\n> restless interests. The mysterious player's wild and unexpected ideas\n> caused her campaigns to fail as often as they succeeded--- but her\n> surprising successes more than made up for the spectacular failures.\n> Her intriguing alias was \"Juno,\" taken from the queen of the Roman\n> gods, wife of Jupiter.\n>\n> Drawn together by their common ambition, their relationship was fiery\n> and challenging, more than just sex. They pleasured themselves by\n> developing\n>\n> thought-experiments. It was a game at first . . . and then much more\n> than that.\n>\n> Their lives changed dramatically when they had heard Tlaloc speak.\n>\n> The offworld visionary, with his disturbing, chastising accusations\n> against complacent humanity on Earth, made the two young schemers\n> realize that their plans could blossom into more than just imaginative\n> adventures.\n>\n> Juno, whose real name was Julianna Parhi, had brought the three of\n> them together. She and Andrew Skouros arranged to speak with Tlaloc,\n> who was excited to learn that they shared his dreams. \"We may be few,\"\n> Tlaloc had said, \"but in Earth's forests full of deadwood, three\n> matches may be enough to spark a conflagration.\"\n>\n> Meeting secretly, the rebellious trio plotted to overthrow the\n> sleeping Empire. Using Andrew's military expertise, they saw that a\n> small investment of hardware and manpower could take over many worlds\n> that had fallen into apathetic stupor. With a little luck and\n> acceptable tactics, like-minded leaders could form an iron grip around\n> the Old Empire. In fact, if the plans were properly set in motion, the\n> conquerors could achieve victory before anyone even noticed.\n>\n> \"It is for humanity's own good,\" Tlaloc had said, his eyes sparkling.\n> \"And for ours,\" Juno added. \"Just a little.\"\n>\n> In one of her innovative plans, Juno utilized the pervasive network of\n> thinking machines and their servile robots. The docile computers had\n> been given artificial intelligence to watch over every aspect of human\n> society, but Julianna saw them as an invasion army already in place .\n> . . if only they could be reprogrammed, given a taste for conquest and\n> human ambition. It was then that they had brought in a computer\n> specialist named Vilhelm Jayther--- who called himself Barbarossa on\n> computer networks--- to implement the technical details.\n>\n> Thus began the Time of Titans, during which a handful of enthusiastic\n> humans controlled the sleeping populace. They had work to do, an\n> empire to rule.\n>\n> During their planning stages, Julianna Parhi often queried a reluctant\n> Cogitor advisor, Eklo. While consulting the ancient Cogitor, one of\n> many spiritual minds who contemplated esoteric questions, she had seen\n> the possibilities of living as a disembodied brain. Not just for\n> introspection, but for action. She realized the advantages a *cymek*\n> tyrant would have over simple humans, able to switch mechanical bodies\n> as circumstances changed. As cymeks, the Titans could live and rule\n> for thousands of years.\n>\n> Perhaps that would be long enough.\n>\n> Agamemnon had immediately agreed with Juno's concept, though he faced\n> a primitive fear of the surgery itself. He and Juno knew that as the\n> Titans experienced the dangers of the universe and the fragility of\n> their human bodies, they would all come around.\n>\n> To show faith in his lover, Agamemnon was the first to undergo the\n> cymek process. He and Juno had spent a last heated night together,\n> naked and touching, storing memories of nerve sensations that would\n> have to last for millennia. Juno had tossed her raven hair, given him\n> a final, tender kiss, and led him into the surgical chamber. There,\n> computerized medical apparatus, robotic surgeons, and dozens of\n> life-support systems waited for him.\n>\n> The Cogitor Eklo had observed and assisted, offering advice whenever\n> necessary, providing precise instructions for the robotic surgeons.\n> Juno had watched her lover, eyes misty as she witnessed the\n> transformation process. Agamemnon feared that she would become\n> squeamish after that and renege on her own plans. But once his brain\n> hung suspended in dynamic electrafluid, once the thoughtrodes were\n> activated and he could \"see\" again through a galaxy of optic threads,\n> Juno was there admiring him, studying the brain canister.\n>\n> She had touched his transparent case with her fingertips. Agamemnon\n> watched it all, focusing and adjusting his new and unfamiliar sensors,\n>\n> enthralled with the ability to observe everything at once.\n>\n> A week later, when he felt competent enough with his new mechanical\n> systems, Agamemnon had returned the favor, watching over Juno as the\n> robotic surgeons sawed open her skull and removed her talented brain,\n> discarding forever the fallible female body of Julianna Parhi. . . .\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> CENTURIES LATER, EVEN without biological bodies, he and Juno remained\n> side by side on their chrome pedestals, connected by receptors and\n> stimulus patches.\n>\n> Agamemnon knew precisely which parts of Juno's brain to pulse in order\n> to activate pleasure centers, and how long to maintain the\n> stimulation. She responded in kind, bringing forth his stored memories\n> of human lovemaking and then amplifying the remembered sensations,\n> stunning him with new heights of euphoria. He struck back with a bolt\n> of his own, causing her brain to quiver.\n>\n> Through it all, the information-gathering watcheyes of Omnius observed\n> intently, like a mechanized voyeur. Even in a time such as this,\n> Agamemnon and Juno were never alone.\n>\n> She pleasured him twice more, making his mind throb; he wanted her to\n> stop so that he could rest, but also longed for her to continue.\n> Agamemnon reciprocated, causing a thin, vibrating sound to pulse from\n> the speakers attached to the canisters, an eerie warbling music that\n> symbolized their merging orgasms. He could barely think through the\n> haze of delight.\n>\n> But his brooding anger continued in the background. Though Omnius\n> allowed him and Juno to have their ecstasy as often as they wished,\n> Agamemnon would have derived even greater pleasure if they could\n> permanently escape the domination of the damned thinking machines.\n>\n> *I fear that Norma will never amount to anything. How does that\n> reflect on me and my own legacy to humanity?*\n>\n> --- ZUFA CENVA\n>\n> **D**uring the tedious month-long journey across space to visit her\n> daughter on Poritrin, Zufa Cenva had plenty of time to ponder what she\n> would say when she arrived. She would rather have been spending so\n> many days and weeks elsewhere on her more important work. The loss of\n> dear Heoma weighed like a hot stone inside her chest. Ever since the\n> first devastating attack against the cymeks on Giedi Prime, Zufa had\n> been planning further strikes with her other Sorceress weapons.\n>\n> While most members of the League gave credit to Savant Holtzman for\n> the portable scrambler projectors, she had heard whispers that Norma\n> herself may have inspired the design. Could her oddball daughter have\n> done something so remarkable? Not as great as a psychic storm\n> obliterating cymeks, but still respectable. *Perhaps I have been blind\n> after all.* Zufa had never wanted Norma to fail, but had given up hope\n> by now. Maybe things could change in their relationship. *Should I\n> embrace her? Does she deserve my support and encouragement, or will\n> she make me ashamed of her?*\n>\n> These were uncertain times.\n>\n> As Zufa stepped off the transport in Starda, she encountered a\n> delegation waiting to greet her, complete with ornately garbed Dragoon\n> guards, their gold-scale armor immaculate. Ruddy-faced Lord Niko Bludd\n> himself led the group, his beard intricately curled, his clothes\n> perfumed and colorful.\n>\n> \"Poritrin is honored by the visit of a Sorceress!\" The noble stepped\n> forward on the mosaic tile floor. Bludd wore a dashing ceremonial\n> costume with broad carmine lapels, frilly white cuffs, and golden\n> shoes. A ceremonial sword hung at his waist, though he had probably\n> never used a blade for anything more dangerous than cutting cheese.\n>\n> She'd never had any use for frippery when there was work to be done,\n> and Bludd's arrival surprised her. She had hoped to conclude her\n> business with Norma unobtrusively and then quickly return to Rossak.\n> She and her dedicated psychic warriors must prepare another mental\n> strike against the cymeks.\n>\n> \"The shuttle captain transmitted a message that you were coming,\n> Madame Cenva,\" Bludd said, as he guided her through the terminal. \"We\n> barely had time to put together a reception for you. You are here to\n> see your daughter, I presume?\" Niko Bludd grinned above his curled\n> reddish beard. \"We are very proud of how much she is helping Savant\n> Holtzman. He considers her quite indispensible.\"\n>\n> \"Indeed?\" Zufa tried to control her skeptical frown.\n>\n> \"We invited Norma to join us today, but she is deeply engrossed in\n> important work for Savant Holtzman. She seemed to think that you would\n> understand why she could not meet you herself.\"\n>\n> Zufa felt as if she had been slapped. \"I have been en route for a\n> month. If *I* can make the time, then a mere . . . lab assistant can\n> arrange to pick me up.\"\n>\n> Outside the spaceport, a chauffeur guided her to a lavish airbarge,\n> and the Dragoon guards took their places at the rails. \"We will\n> transport you directly to Holtzman's laboratories.\" When Bludd seated\n> himself beside her, she wrinkled her nose at his strong body perfumes.\n> He extended a small package to her, which she didn't want.\n>\n> With a sigh of exasperation, Zufa sat rigidly in the comfortable seat\n> as the aircraft proceeded away from the spaceport. Removing the\n> package's silver wrapping paper, Zufa found a bottle of river water\n> and an exquisitely woven Poritrin towel.\n>\n> Despite her lack of interest, the flamboyant noble insisted on\n> explaining. \"It is traditional for honored guests to wash their hands\n> in the water of the Isana and dry themselves on our fine linen.\"\n>\n> She made no move to use the gifts. Beneath the flying barge, water\n> vessels traveled downriver toward the sprawling delta city, where\n> grains, metals, and manufactured supplies were distributed to Poritrin\n> suppliers. In the brown mudflats, hundreds of slaves worked in the\n> muck to plant paddies of shellfish. The sight made her feel even more\n> unsettled than she already was.\n>\n> \"The residence of Savant Holtzman is just ahead,\" Bludd said, pointing\n> to a high bluff. \"I am sure your daughter will be pleased to see you.\"\n>\n> *Has she ever been pleased to see me?* Zufa wondered. She tried to\n> calm herself with mental exercises, but anxiety intruded.\n>\n> With a sweep of her long black dress, she stepped away from the\n> ostentatious airbarge as soon as it set down on Holtzman's landing\n> deck. \"Lord Bludd, I have private business to discuss with my\n> daughter. I'm sure you understand.\" Without further farewell, Zufa\n> marched alone up the broad patio steps to the mansion, leaving a\n> befuddled Bludd behind her. She waved her long arms, shooing him away.\n>\n> Her telepathic senses attuned, Zufa entered the dwelling as if she\n> belonged there. Holtzman's vestibule was cluttered with disarrayed\n> boxes, books, and instruments. Either the household staff did not do\n> their work, or the inventor had forbidden them to \"organize\" too much.\n>\n> Picking a path through the obstacles, Zufa strode into a long hallway,\n> then searched rooms and demanded information from anyone she met until\n> she found her daughter. Finally, the tall and intimidating Sorceress\n> entered an auxiliary laboratory building, where she saw a high stool\n> at an angled lightstrip table that held blueprint films. No sign of\n> Norma.\n>\n> She noticed an open door that led out to a balcony, then saw a shadow,\n> heard something move. Gliding to the balcony, Zufa was shocked to see\n> her daughter perched on top of the railing. Norma gripped a red plaz\n> container in her small hands.\n>\n> \"What are you doing?\" Zufa asked. \"Get down from there immediately!\"\n>\n> Startled, Norma glanced at her looming mother, then clasped the object\n> tightly and leaped off the railing out into the open air.\n>\n> \"No!\" Zufa shouted. But it was too late.\n>\n> Rushing to the edge, the Sorceress saw to her horror that the balcony\n> jutted out over a high bluff that dropped to the river, far below. The\n> small-statured young woman tumbled through the air, falling.\n>\n> Suddenly, Norma paused in midair and spun in a peculiar fashion. She\n> called, \"See for yourself, it works! You arrived just in time!\" Then,\n> like a feather on the wind, the girl drifted upward. The red device\n> lifted her back toward the balcony, like an invisible hand.\n>\n> Norma reached the level of the railing, and her angry mother yanked\n> her back onto the balcony. \"Why would you try something so dangerous?\n> Doesn't Savant Holtzman prefer you to employ helpers for this sort of\n> test?\"\n>\n> Norma frowned. \"They have *slaves* here, not helpers. Besides, it is\n> my own invention, and I wanted to do it myself. I knew it would work.\"\n>\n> Zufa did not want to argue. \"You came all the way to Poritrin and used\n> the League's best engineering laboratories to design some sort of . .\n> . flying toy?\"\n>\n> \"Hardly, Mother.\" Norma opened the lid of the red plaz unit and\n> adjusted electronics inside. \"It is a variation on Savant Holtzman's\n> theories, a repelling, or suspensor field. I expect him to be\n> delighted by it.\"\n>\n> \"Oh, I am, I am!\" The scientist appeared suddenly and stood behind\n> Zufa. He quickly introduced himself, then looked at Norma's new\n> gadget. \"I'll show it to Lord Bludd and see what he thinks of the\n> commercial possibilities. I'm sure he'll want a patent in his own\n> name.\"\n>\n> Zufa looked on, still recovering from the shock of Norma's \"fall,\"\n> trying to see practical applications of her daughter's invention.\n> Could such a thing be\n>\n> modified to carry troops or heavy objects? She doubted it.\n>\n> Norma set down the red-plaz generator and crossed the room with her\n> awkward, waddling gait. She climbed her high stool to reach the\n> blueprint films on the slanted light table, where she sifted through\n> pages. \"I've figured out how this principle can also be used on\n> illumination devices. The suspensor field can float lights and power\n> them with residual energy. I have all the calculations . . .\n> somewhere.\"\n>\n> \"Floating lights?\" Zufa said, in scornful tone. \"For what, a picnic?\n> Tens of thousands died in the cymek attack on Zimia, millions were\n> enslaved on Giedi Prime, and you live in secluded comfort--- making\n> floating *lights*?\"\n>\n> Norma gave her mother a condescending look, as if *Zufa* was the\n> foolish one. \"Think beyond the obvious, Mother. A war needs more than\n> just weapons. Robots can alter their optic sensors to see in the dark,\n> but humans must have light to see. Hundreds of these suspensor lights\n> could be dispersed in a nighttime combat zone, negating any advantage\n> the machines might have. Savant Holtzman and I think along those lines\n> every day.\"\n>\n> The scientist nodded, quick to concur with her. \"Or, for commercial\n> uses, they could be designed in a number of styles, even tuned to any\n> color or shade.\"\n>\n> Norma sat on her stool like a gnome perched on a throne. Her brown\n> eyes sparkled with excitement. \"I'm sure Lord Bludd will be most\n> pleased.\"\n>\n> Zufa frowned. There were more important issues at stake in this war\n> than pleasing a foppish nobleman. Impatient, she said, \"I came a great\n> distance to see you.\"\n>\n> Norma raised her eyebrows skeptically. \"If you had bothered to see me\n> *before* I departed from Rossak, Mother, you wouldn't have needed to\n> make such a long voyage to soothe your guilt. But you were too busy to\n> notice.\"\n>\n> Uneasy in the midst of a family argument, Tio Holtzman excused\n> himself.\n>\n> The combatants hardly noticed his departure.\n>\n> Zufa had not intended to pick a fight, but now she felt defensive. \"My\n> Sorceresses have proved their abilities in battle. We can exert\n> tremendous power with our minds to eradicate the cymeks. A number of\n> candidates are preparing themselves to offer the ultimate sacrifice if\n> we are called upon to free another machine-dominated world.\" Her pale\n> eyes flashed, and she shook her head. \"But you don't worry about that,\n> do you, Norma--- since you have no telepathic abilities.\"\n>\n> \"I have other skills, Mother. I am making a valuable contribution,\n> too.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, your incomprehensible equations.\" Zufa nodded toward the\n> suspensor field generator on the floor. \"Your life is not at stake.\n> Safe and pampered, you spend your days playing with these *toys*. You\n> have let yourself be blinded by imaginary success.\" But her daughter\n> wasn't the only one. Many people lived in comfort and security while\n> Zufa and her Sorceresses performed dangerous tasks. How could Norma\n> compare her work to *that*? \"When you heard I was coming, Norma, could\n> you not have found time to meet me at the spaceport?\"\n>\n> Norma's tone was deceptively mild as she crossed her arms over her\n> small chest. \"I did not ask you to come here, Mother, because I know\n> you have many important things to do. And *I* have more urgent duties\n> than ferrying unexpected guests around. Besides, I knew Lord Bludd was\n> going to meet you.\"\n>\n> \"Are League nobles your errand boys now?\" Now that she had opened the\n> floodgates of her anger, Zufa couldn't stop the words that came next.\n> \"I only wanted you to make me proud, Norma, despite your deformities.\n> But nothing you do will ever amount to anything. Living here in\n> luxury, what sacrifices do you make? Your vision is too small to be of\n> any real use to humanity.\"\n>\n> Previously, Norma would have crumbled under such an onslaught, her\n> confidence crushed. But her work here with Holtzman, her obvious\n> successes in the technical arena, had given her a new view of herself.\n> Now she looked coolly at her mother. \"Just because I don't fit the\n> image of what\n>\n> you wanted me to be doesn't mean I'm not contributing something\n> essential. Savant Holtzman sees it, and so does Aurelius. You're my\n> own mother--- why can't you?\"\n>\n> With a snort at the mention of Venport's name, Zufa began pacing.\n> \"Aurelius is just a man with hallucinations from the drugs he takes.\"\n>\n> \"I had forgotten how narrow-minded you truly are, Mother,\" Norma said\n> in a level tone. \"Thank you for coming all this way to refresh my\n> memory.\" The girl turned on her stool and resumed her plans and\n> equations. \"I am tempted to summon one of the slaves to escort you\n> out, but I wouldn't want to remove them from their more important\n> work.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> FURIOUS AT HERSELF and her daughter--- and at the wasted time--- Zufa\n> returned to the spaceport. She would stay on Poritrin no longer. To\n> get her mind off her concerns, she concentrated on mental exercises\n> and thought of how her beloved trainees in the jungles were ready to\n> give their utmost to their tasks, without personal considerations.\n>\n> Zufa waited a full day for a military transport that would take her\n> back to Rossak. As she surrounded herself with waves of her own\n> clairvoyant powers, she discovered a rotten weakness on Poritrin, and\n> it had nothing to do with Norma. It was so obvious, she could not\n> avoid it.\n>\n> All around Starda, at loading sites near the spaceport, at the\n> warehouses and mudflats, Zufa detected the individual and collective\n> auras of the downtrodden laborers. She sensed a collective\n> psychological wound, a deep and simmering discontent to which the free\n> Poritrin citizens seemed completely oblivious.\n>\n> The backwash of brooding resentment gave her one more reason to want\n> to get away from this place.\n>\n> *Intuition is a function by which humans see around corners.

She had never\n> imagined laboring as a slave inside the household of an enemy robot.\n>\n> From her first glance at Erasmus in the broad entry plaza of the\n> villa, Serena disliked him intensely. Conversely, the thinking machine\n> was intrigued by her. She suspected that his interest was probably a\n> dangerous thing.\n>\n> He chose to wear fine clothes, loose robes and fluffy, ornate furs\n> that made his robot body look absurd. His mirrored face made him\n> appear alien, and his demeanor made her flesh crawl. His relentless\n> curiosity about mankind seemed perverse and unnatural. When he\n> strutted across the plaza toward Serena, his pliable metal mask\n> shifted into a delighted grin.\n>\n> \"You are Serena Butler,\" he said. \"Have you been informed that Giedi\n> Prime was recaptured by the feral humans? Such a disappointment. Why\n> are humans willing to sacrifice so much to maintain their inefficient\n> chaos?\"\n>\n> Serena's heart lifted at news of the liberation, in part because of\n> her own efforts. Xavier had brought the Armada after all, and Brigit\n> Paterson's engineers must have succeeded in activating the secondary\n> shield transmitters. Serena, however, remained enslaved--- and\n> pregnant with Xavier's child. No one even knew where she was or what\n> had happened to her. Xavier and her father must be insane with grief,\n> convinced that the machines had killed her.\n>\n> \"Perhaps it's not surprising that you don't comprehend or value the\n> human concept of freedom,\" she replied. \"For all your convoluted\n> gelcircuitry, you're still just a machine. The understanding wasn't\n> *programmed* into you.\"\n>\n> Her eyes stung at the thought of how much more she wanted to achieve\n> to help other people. On Salusa, she had never taken her family's\n> wealth for granted, feeling a need to earn the blessings bestowed upon\n> her.\n>\n> She asked, \"So, are you inquisitive, or inquisitor?\"\n>\n> \"Perhaps both.\" The robot leaned close to examine her, noting the\n> proud lift of her chin. \"I expect you to offer me many insights.\" He\n> touched her cheek with a cool, flexible finger. \"Lovely skin.\"\n>\n> She forced herself not to pull away. *Resistance must count for\n> something more than a captive's pride*, her mother had once told her.\n> If Serena struggled, Erasmus could hold her with his powerful robotic\n> grasp, or summon mechanized torturing devices. \"My skin is no more\n> lovely than yours,\" she said, \"except mine is not synthetic. My skin\n> was designed by nature, not by the mind of a machine.\"\n>\n> The robot chuckled, a tinny cachination. \"You see, I expect to learn\n> much from you.\" He led her into his lush greenhouses, which she\n> observed with reluctant delight.\n>\n> At the age of ten she had become fascinated with gardening, and had\n> delivered plants, herbs, and sweet exotic fruits to medical centers,\n> refugee complexes, and veteran homes, where she also volunteered her\n> services. Around Zimia, Serena had been renowned for her ability to\n> cultivate beautiful flowers. Under her loving attention, exquisite\n> little Immian roses bloomed, as did Poritrin hibiscus and even the\n> delicate morning violets of distant Kaitain.\n>\n> \"I will have you tend my prized plaza gardens,\" Erasmus said.\n>\n> \"Why can't machines perform such tasks? I'm sure they'd be much more\n> efficient--- or do you just revel in making your 'creators' do the\n> work?\"\n>\n> \"Do you not feel up to the task?\"\n>\n> \"I will do as you command--- for the sake of the plants.\" Pointedly\n> ignoring him, she touched a strangely shaped red and orange flower.\n> \"This looks like a bird of paradise, a pure strain from an ancient\n> stock. According to legend, these plants were favored by the sea kings\n> of Old Earth.\" With a look of defiance, Serena turned back to the\n> robot. \"There, now I have taught you something.\"\n>\n> Erasmus chuckled again, as if replaying a recording. \"Excellent. Now\n> tell me what you were truly thinking.\"\n>\n> She remembered words her father had spoken---*Fear invites aggression;\n> do not show it to a predator*--- and felt emboldened. \"While I was\n> telling you about a beautiful flower, I was thinking that I despise\n> you and all of your kind. I was a free and independent being, until\n> you took it all away from me. Machines stole my home, my life, and the\n> man I love.\"\n>\n> The sentient robot was not at all offended. \"Ah, your lover! Is he the\n> one who impregnated you?\"\n>\n> Serena glared at Erasmus, then made up her mind. Perhaps she could\n> find a way to use this machine's curiosity, turning it against him\n> somehow. \"You will learn the most from me if I cooperate, if I talk\n> freely. I can teach you things you would never learn for yourself.\"\n>\n> \"Excellent.\" The robot seemed genuinely pleased.\n>\n> Serena's eyes grew hard. \"But I expect something from you in return.\n> Guarantee the safety of my unborn baby. Allow me to raise the child\n> here in your household.\"\n>\n> Erasmus knew it was a standard parental imperative for her to be\n> worried about her offspring, and that gave him leverage. \"You have\n> either arrogance\n>\n> or ambition. But I shall consider your request, depending on how much\n> I enjoy our discussions and debates.\"\n>\n> Spotting a fat beetle at the base of a terra cotta planter, Erasmus\n> nudged it with one foot. The insect had a black shell with an\n> intricate red design. His smooth face mask shifted, flowed, until the\n> shaping film displayed an amused expression. Erasmus let the beetle\n> nearly escape, then moved his smooth foot to block it again.\n> Persistent, it scuttled in another direction.\n>\n> \"You and I have a great deal in common, Serena Butler,\" he said.\n> Remotely, he activated a contraband Chusuk music cube, hoping the\n> melody would draw out her internal emotions. \"Each of us has an\n> independent mind. I respect that in you, because it is such an\n> integral part of my own personality.\"\n>\n> Serena resented any such comparison, but held her tongue.\n>\n> Erasmus scooped the beetle onto one hand, but his primary interest\n> dwelled on Serena--- he was intrigued at how humans tried to keep so\n> much of themselves veiled. Perhaps, by applying various pressures, he\n> could see through to her inner core.\n>\n> With the music playing in the background, Erasmus continued, \"Some\n> robots keep their own personalities rather than simply uploading a\n> portion of the evermind. I began as a thinking machine on Corrin, but\n> I chose not to accept regular Omnius updates that would synchronize me\n> with the evermind.\"\n>\n> Serena saw that the beetle was immobile on his metallic palm. She\n> wondered if he had killed it.\n>\n> \"But a singular event changed me forever,\" Erasmus said, his voice\n> pleasant, as if telling a story about a quaint forest outing. \"I had\n> set out across Corrin's unsettled territories on a private scouting\n> mission. Because I was inquisitive and did not wish to accept the\n> standard analyses compiled by Omnius, I ventured into the landscape on\n> my own. It was rugged, rocky, and wild. I had never seen vegetation\n> except for in the areas where Old\n>\n> Empire terraformers had planted new ecosystems. Corrin was never a\n> living world, you see, except where humans had made it so.\n> Unfortunately, tending fertile fields and beautifying the land was no\n> longer a priority of my kind.\" He looked at Serena to see if she was\n> enjoying his story.\n>\n> \"Unexpectedly, far from the city grid and robot support systems, I was\n> unprotected from a severe solar storm. Corrin's red-giant sun is in\n> turmoil and unstable, with frequent flare activity, sudden hurricanes\n> of radiation. Such an onslaught is hazardous to biological life-forms,\n> but the original human settlers were resilient.\n>\n> \"My delicate neurelectric circuitry, however, was rather more\n> sensitive. I should have dispatched scout scanners to keep watch on\n> the star-storms, but I was too engrossed in my own investigations. I\n> found myself exposed and damaged from the radiation flux, disoriented\n> and far from the central complex run by the Corrin-Omnius.\" Erasmus\n> actually sounded embarrassed. \"I wandered away and I . . . tumbled\n> into a narrow crevasse.\"\n>\n> Serena looked at him in surprise.\n>\n> \"Despite dropping deep into the crack, my body was only slightly\n> damaged.\" He lifted an arm, looked at his flexible fiber-wrapped limb,\n> the organic-polymer skin, the flowmetal coating. \"I was trapped, out\n> of transmission range, and basically immobilized. I could not move for\n> an entire Corrin year . . . twenty Terran standard years.\n>\n> \"The crevasse's deep shadow shielded me from solar radiation, and soon\n> enough, my mental processors recovered. I was awake, but I could go\n> nowhere. I could not move . . . only think, for a long, long time. I\n> spent a seemingly endless blazing summer there, wedged in the rocks,\n> and then I endured the ensuing long winter locked in heavy, compacted\n> ice. During all that time, two decades, I had nothing to do but\n> *contemplate*.\"\n>\n> \"No one to talk to but yourself,\" she said. \"Poor, lonely robot.\"\n>\n> Ignoring the remark, Erasmus said, \"Such an ordeal altered my\n> fundamental nature in ways I could never have foreseen. In fact,\n> Omnius still does not\n>\n> understand me.\"\n>\n> By the time he'd finally been discovered and rescued by other robots,\n> Erasmus had developed an individual personality. After his restoration\n> and reintegration into the cooperative machine society, Omnius had\n> asked Erasmus if he wished to be upgraded with standardized character\n> traits.\n>\n> \"*Upgraded*, he called it,\" Erasmus said with some amusement. \"But I\n> declined the offer. After reaching such . . . enlightenment, I was\n> reluctant to delete my impulses and ideas, my thoughts and memories.\n> It seemed too great a loss to bear. And the Corrin-Omnius soon\n> discovered how much he enjoyed sparring with me verbally.\"\n>\n> Now, peering at the motionless beetle on his artificial hand, Erasmus\n> said matter-of-factly, \"I am a celebrity among the widespread\n> everminds. They look forward to receiving updates containing my\n> actions and assertions, like a serial publication. These are known as\n> the 'Erasmus Dialogues.'\"\n>\n> With a guarded look, she nodded toward the motionless insect. \"And\n> will you include a discussion of that beetle? How can you understand\n> something you have killed?\"\n>\n> \"It is not dead,\" Erasmus assured her. \"I detect a faint but\n> unmistakable throb of life. The creature wants me to believe it is\n> deceased, so that I will discard it. Despite its small size, it has a\n> powerful will to survive.\"\n>\n> Kneeling, he set the beetle on a flagstone with a surprisingly gentle\n> touch, then stepped back. Moments later, the bug stirred and scampered\n> to safety under the planter. \"See? I wish to understand all living\n> things--- including you.\"\n>\n> Serena glowered. The robot had managed to surprise her.\n>\n> \"Omnius does not think I can ever attain his intellectual level,\"\n> Erasmus said. \"But he remains intrigued by my mental agility--- the\n> way my mind continually evolves in new and impulsive directions. Like\n> that beetle, I am capable of springing to life and persevering.\"\n>\n> \"Do you really expect to become more than a machine?\"\n>\n> Taking no offense, Erasmus replied, \"It is a human trait to better\n> oneself, is it not? That is all I am trying to do.\"\n>\n> *One direction is as good as another.*\n>\n> --- saying of the Open Land\n>\n> **B**y the tenth time he rode a giant sandworm, Selim was proficient\n> enough to enjoy the experience. No other thrill could compare to the\n> power of a leviathan of the deep desert. He loved racing across the\n> dunes while perched on the high ridges of a worm, crossing an ocean of\n> sand in a single day.\n>\n> Selim had brought water, rugged clothing, equipment, and food from the\n> abandoned botanical testing station. His crystal sandworm tooth proved\n> a valuable tool as well as a mark of personal pride. Inside the empty\n> station, he had sometimes stared at the smooth milky curve of the\n> blade under the dim light of recharge panels and imagined a religious\n> significance to the object. It was a relic of his supreme test out\n> here in this wasteland, and a symbol that Buddallah was watching over\n> him. Perhaps the worms were part of his destiny.\n>\n> He came to believe that the sandworms were not Shaitan after all, but\n> blessings from Buddallah himself, perhaps even tangible manifestations\n> of God.\n>\n> After months of recuperation and boredom inside the old research\n> facility, living without purpose, Selim had known he must go out and\n> ride a sandworm again. He needed to learn exactly what it was that\n> Buddallah expected of him.\n>\n> He had carefully marked the location of the testing station.\n> Unfortunately, since he couldn't guide the sandworms, he knew it would\n> be a challenge to make his way back to the secret place. Upon\n> departing, he had carried everything necessary on his back.\n>\n> He was Selim Wormrider, chosen and guided by Buddallah. He needed no\n> help from others.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AFTER KILLING TWO more sandworms by riding them until they collapsed\n> of exhaustion, Selim discovered that it was not necessary to slay a\n> worm just so he could get safely away. It was possible, though risky,\n> to dismount from a weary beast by running down the length of its back,\n> leaping away from the hot tail, and then racing toward nearby rocks.\n> The depleted worm, too tired to give chase, would wallow in deep dust,\n> and sulk.\n>\n> This satisfied Selim, because it seemed wrong to destroy the creatures\n> that gave him transportation. If the sandworms were emissaries from\n> Buddallah, and old men of the desert, then he must treat them with\n> respect.\n>\n> On his fourth ride, he discovered how to manipulate the sensitive\n> edges of worm rings, using a shovel-bladed tool and the sharp metal\n> spear to prod Shaitan in the direction Selim wished to go. It was a\n> simple concept, but one that required a great deal of work. His\n> muscles ached by the time he dropped away from a spent worm and ran to\n> the shelter of nearby rocks. He remained lost out in the deep desert .\n> . . but in a very real sense, the desert belonged to him now. He was\n> invincible! Buddallah would care for him.\n>\n> Selim still had an adequate supply of water from the distilling units\n> in the testing station, and his diet consisted of large amounts of\n> melange, which gave him strength and energy. As soon as he learned how\n> to master the worms, he was able to travel wherever he chose, working\n> his way back toward the abandoned station.\n>\n> Other Zensunnis would have called him mad, appalled at his foolhardy\n> attempt to tame the terrifying sandworms. But the young exile no\n> longer cared a whit how people felt about him. He was in touch with\n> another realm. He felt in his heart that this was what he had been\n> born todo. . . .\n>\n> Now under the double moonlight, Selim guided his worm as it hissed\n> across the sands. Hours ago, the creature had ceased trying to throw\n> him off, and instead plunged onward, resigned to the commands of the\n> imp who kept inflicting pain in the sensitive flesh between ring\n> segments. Selim navigated\n>\n> by the stars, drawing lines like arrows between constellations. The\n> unforgiving landscape began to look familiar, and he believed he was\n> at last close to the botanical testing station, his sanctuary. Back\n> home.\n>\n> All alone atop the sandworm, surrounded by the bitter aromas of\n> brimstone and cinnamon, he allowed himself to think and dream. He'd\n> had little else to do since his exile. Was that not how great\n> philosophers were born?\n>\n> Someday perhaps, he would use the abandoned facility as the seed of\n> his own colony. Maybe he could gather disaffected people from other\n> Zensunni villages, outcasts like himself who wanted to live without\n> oppressive strictures enforced by inflexible naibs. By controlling the\n> great worms, Selim's people would have a strength that no outlaws had\n> ever possessed.\n>\n> Was that what Buddallah wanted him to do?\n>\n> The young man smiled at his daydream, then grew sad as he recalled\n> Ebrahim, who had so easily turned against him. As if that was not\n> enough, he had then joined others in hurling insults and stones at\n> Selim.\n>\n> As his sandworm crashed over the dunes, the young rider finally saw\n> the line of rocks ahead, familiar crags and dark formations. His heart\n> leaped with joy. The behemoth had carried him home faster than\n> anticipated. He grinned, then realized it would be a challenge to\n> dismount from the feisty demon, which was not yet exhausted. Another\n> test?\n>\n> Using his spear and the shovel-spreader, Selim drove the worm toward\n> the rocks, thinking he might beach the creature on the outcroppings,\n> where it would thrash and wriggle its way back to the soft sanctuary\n> of sand. The eyeless monster sensed the rocks, recognizing a\n> difference in viscosity and vibrations within the sand, and swerved in\n> the opposite direction.\n>\n> Selim pulled harder on the shovel and jabbed with the spear. The\n> confused worm twitched and slowed. As it curled close to the nearest\n> line of rock, Selim yanked himself and his equipment free. He tumbled\n> down the creature's ring segments until he dropped to the sand and\n> then ran away at full speed.\n>\n> The safe reef of rock was less than a hundred meters distant, and the\n> worm thrashed about as if it couldn't believe it had been so\n> unexpectedly released. Finally, it sensed the rhythm of Selim's racing\n> footsteps. The monster turned and lunged toward him.\n>\n> Selim ran faster, bolting toward the boulders. He sprang onto a shelf\n> of sharp lava rock and kept running, spitting pebbles from beneath the\n> soles of his boots.\n>\n> The worm exploded out of the sand, its head questing, its cavernous\n> maw open. It hesitated as if afraid to go closer to the rock barrier,\n> then slammed downward.\n>\n> Selim had already scrambled up and over the second line of boulders,\n> diving between rough-edged stones into a pocket, less than a cave but\n> enough for him to wedge his body into. The sandworm crashed like a\n> gigantic hammer into the ridge, but it did not know where the little\n> human had gone to ground.\n>\n> Enraged, the worm pulled back, its gaping mouth exuding an\n> overpowering stench of melange. It smashed its big head against the\n> rocks again, then retreated. Frustrated and beaten, it finally dragged\n> itself away, wallowed through the sands, and then sank below the dune\n> crests. Slow and indignant, it headed back out to the deep desert.\n>\n> His heart pounding, adrenaline charging his bloodstream, Selim crawled\n> out of the shelter. He looked around, amazed that he had made it back\n> alive. Laughing, he praised Buddallah at the top of his lungs. The old\n> botanical testing station was above him on the ridge, waiting for him.\n> He would spend several days there, replenishing his supplies and\n> drinking plenty of water.\n>\n> As he began to climb with weary arms and legs, Selim saw something\n> glint in the moonlight, lost in the broken rocks against which the\n> furious worm had smashed itself. Another crystalline tooth, a longer\n> one. It had broken free during the demon's attack and now lay in a\n> cranny. Selim reached down and plucked out the curved, milky weapon. A\n> reward from\n>\n> Buddallah! He held it high triumphantly before turning to make his way\n> up to the derelict station.\n>\n> Now he had two of them.\n>\n> *Time depends on the position of the observer and the direction in\n> which he looks.*\n>\n> --- COGITOR KWYNA,\n\nCity of Introspection archives\n\n> **S**till angry, Zufa Cenva returned to Rossak, where she intended to\n> focus on the escalating war.

Now he had to\n> conduct his investigations in such a manner that the machines would\n> never suspect his intent.\n>\n> For answers, he could think of no better source than the Cogitor Eklo.\n>\n> Years ago Iblis had been a member of an armed slave-pursuit team,\n> chasing a few deluded people who had senselessly escaped from the city\n> grid and fled into the hills with no plans, survival skills, or\n> supplies. Wild rumors had convinced the gullible escapees that they\n> could demand sanctuary from the politically neutral Cogitors. A\n> foolish notion, considering that the meditative and detached human\n> brains wanted nothing more than to isolate themselves and contemplate\n> their esoteric thoughts. The Cogitors had not cared about the Time of\n> Titans, the Hrethgir Rebellions, or Omnius's creation of the\n> Synchronized Worlds. Cogitors did not wish to be disturbed, so the\n> thinking machines tolerated them.\n>\n> When Iblis and his pursuit team had surrounded the isolated monastery\n> on the rugged mountainside, Eklo had dispatched his human secondaries\n> to drive the slaves out of concealment. The escapees had cursed and\n> threatened the Cogitor, but Eklo passively ignored them. Iblis and his\n> armed companions had then brought the slaves in for \"vigorous\n> reassignment,\" after tossing their ringleader off a high cliff. . . .\n>\n> Now the sturdy burrhorse ascended the steep path that shifted and\n> crumbled beneath its hooves. Presently Iblis made out the high tower\n> of the monastery, an impressive stone structure partly shrouded in\n> mists. Its windows glowed red and then shifted to a sky blue,\n> reportedly according to the moods of the great contemplative mind.\n>\n> In his schooling as a trustee, Iblis had learned about the Cogitors,\n> about the primitive remnants of religion still manifested by some of\n> the larger groups of human slaves. Omnius had ceased trying to quash\n> it, though the evermind did not understand the superstitions and\n> rituals.\n>\n> Long before the takeover of the Old Empire, Eklo had left his physical\n> body behind and devoted his mind to analysis and introspection. While\n> planning the large-scale overthrow of humanity, the Titan Juno had\n> adopted Eklo as her personal advisor, demanding answers. Uninterested\n> in repercussions, taking no sides in the conflict, Eklo had answered\n> Juno's questions, and his unwitting advice had helped the Titans plan\n> their conquest. In the thousand years since, Eklo had remained on\n> Earth. The driving passion in his long life was to synthesize a\n> complete understanding of the universe.\n>\n> Reaching the end of the trail at the base of the stone tower, Iblis\n> suddenly found himself surrounded by a dozen robed men armed with\n> archaic pikes and barbed clubs. Their robes were dark brown, and they\n> wore white clerical collars. One of the secondaries grabbed the reins\n> of Iblis's burrhorse. \"Leave here. We offer no sanctuary.\"\n>\n> \"I do not seek it.\" Iblis gazed down at the men. \"I have only come to\n> ask the Cogitor a question.\" He dismounted and, after charming them\n> with his warmth and sincerity, glided confidently toward the high\n> tower, leaving the robed men to hold his burrhorse.\n>\n> \"Cogitor Eklo is deep in thought and does not wish to be disturbed,\"\n> one of the secondaries called out.\n>\n> Iblis chuckled lightly, his voice smooth. \"The Cogitor has been\n> thinking for a thousand years. He can spare a few minutes to hear me\n> out. I am a\n>\n> respected trustee. And if I give him information he doesn't already\n> know, he'll have something more to ponder for the next century or so.\"\n>\n> Muttering in confusion, several secondaries followed Iblis up wide\n> steps. Abruptly, however, as he reached the arched entry, a\n> broad-shouldered monk blocked his way. The muscles on his thick arms\n> and chest had gone to fat, and he peered out from sunken eyesockets\n> with dull eyes.\n>\n> Iblis infused his voice with friendly persuasion. \"I honor the\n> knowledge Cogitor Eklo has acquired. I will not waste his time.\"\n>\n> Frowning skeptically at Iblis, the monk adjusted his clerical collar\n> and said, \"You are bold enough, and the Cogitor is curious to hear\n> your question.\" After checking the visitor's body for weapons, he\n> said, \"I am Aquim. Come this way.\"\n>\n> The big man led Iblis along a narrow stone corridor and up a steep\n> spiral stairway. As they proceeded, Iblis said, \"I have been here\n> before, chasing escaped slaves---\"\n>\n> \"Eklo remembers,\" Aquim interrupted.\n>\n> They reached the highest point in the structure, a round room at the\n> pinnacle of the tower. The Cogitor's plexiplaz container rested on an\n> altarlike ledge beneath one of the windows. Winds hummed along the\n> window edges and swirled the mists. The windows shimmered sky blue\n> from some internal illumination.\n>\n> Leaving the other secondaries behind, Aquim stepped up to the\n> transparent brain canister and stood for a moment, looking down at it\n> reverently. He jabbed a hand into one of his pockets, and his\n> trembling fingers emerged with a twisted strip of paper encrusted with\n> a black powder. He placed the strip in his mouth, letting it dissolve.\n> His eyes rolled upward, as if in ecstasy.\n>\n> \"Semuta,\" he said to Iblis, \"derived from the burned residue of elacca\n> wood, smuggled here. It aids me in what I must do.\" With complete\n>\n> serenity, he rested both hands against the smooth lip of the canister,\n> and said, \"I understand nothing.\"\n>\n> The naked brain inside its blue soup of electrafluid seemed to pulse,\n> waiting.\n>\n> With a beatific smile, the big monk drew a deep breath and slid his\n> fingers into the open mouth of the tank, dipping into the thick\n> life-support liquid. The gelatinous medium wet his skin, penetrated\n> his pores, linked with his nerve endings. Aquim's expression changed,\n> and he said, \"Eklo wishes to know why you did not ask your question\n> the last time you were here.\"\n>\n> Iblis did not know if he should speak to the secondary or directly to\n> the Cogitor, so he directed his reply to a space between them. \"At the\n> time, I did not understand what was significant. Now there is\n> something I wish to know from you. No one else can provide an\n> objective answer.\"\n>\n> \"No judgment or opinion is ever completely objective.\" The big monk\n> spoke with calm conviction. \"There are no absolutes.\"\n>\n> \"You are less biased than anyone else I could ask.\"\n>\n> The altar ledge moved around slowly along a hidden track, and the\n> Cogitor came to rest in front of a different window, with Aquim\n> keeping pace, his hand still immersed in the canister. \"State your\n> question.\"\n>\n> \"I have always worked loyally for my cymek and machine masters,\" Iblis\n> began, selecting his words carefully. \"Lately I received word that\n> there may be human resistance groups on Earth. I wish to know if this\n> report is credible. Are there people who want to overthrow their\n> rulers and gain freedom?\"\n>\n> During a moment's hesitation, the secondary stared blankly into space,\n> either from the effects of the semuta or from his connection with the\n> philosopher brain. Iblis hoped the Cogitor would not drift into a long\n> period of contemplation. Finally, in a deep and sonorous voice, Aquim\n> said, \"Nothing is impossible.\"\n>\n> Iblis tried several variations of the question, deftly circling with\n> phrases, adjusting his selection of words. He did not want to reveal\n> his intentions, though the neutral Cogitor presumably did not care why\n> Iblis might want to find the rebels, whether to destroy them or to\n> join them. Each time, however, Iblis received the same enigmatic\n> answer.\n>\n> Summoning his courage, he finally asked, \"If such a widespread, secret\n> resistance organization *did* exist, would it have a chance of\n> succeeding? Could the reign of the thinking machines possibly come to\n> an end?\"\n>\n> This time the Cogitor pondered longer, as if assessing different\n> factors in the question. When the same answer came via the robed monk,\n> the words, spoken more ominously, seemed to convey a deeper meaning.\n> \"Nothing is impossible.\"\n>\n> After that, Aquim withdrew his dripping hand from Eklo's brain\n> container, signifying that the audience was concluded. Iblis bowed\n> politely, expressed his gratitude, and departed, his own thoughts in\n> turmoil.\n>\n> On the ride back down the steep trail, the frightened but exhilarated\n> crew supervisor decided that if he could not locate one of the\n> resistance group members, he had another option.\n>\n> Drawing from his deeply loyal work crews, Iblis would form a rebel\n> cell of his own.\n>\n> *Conflict prolonged over an extended period tends to be\n> self-perpetuating and can easily plunge out of control.*\n>\n> --- TLALOC,\n>\n> *A Time for Titans*\n>\n> **\"A**fter a thousand years, only five of us remain.\"\n>\n> It was rare for the surviving Titans to congregate, especially on\n> Earth where the eyes of Omnius watched them every moment.

After their\n> triumph on Giedi Prime, however, it is probable that the *hrethgir*\n> will use them to strike again.\"\n>\n> \"Their action has also reminded us of how vulnerable we are,\"\n> Agamemnon said. \"Robots can be replaced. Our organic brains cannot.\"\n>\n> Ajax was so infuriated by the dilemma of the Sorceresses that his\n> life-support monitors had trouble maintaining the proper chemical\n> balance inside his shimmering electrafluid. He could not find words to\n> express his anger.\n>\n> \"But didn't this Sorceress have to kill herself to slay Barbarossa and\n> a handful of neo-cymeks?\" Xerxes asked. \"It was *suicide*. Do you\n> think they'd be willing to do that again?\"\n>\n> \"Just because you're a coward, Xerxes, doesn't mean the feral humans\n> are so afraid to sacrifice themselves,\" Agamemnon said. \"That one\n> Sorceress cost us seven neo-cymeks and a Titan. A staggering loss.\"\n>\n> After living a thousand years, during which billions upon billions of\n> human lives were lost (many at Agamemnon's own hands or while he\n> watched), he had thought he was immune to witnessing death. Of the\n> original Titans, Barbarossa, Juno, and Tlaloc had been his closest\n> friends. The four of them had been the seeds of the rebellion. The\n> other Titans had come later, adding to the junta as necessary.\n>\n> Despite the fact that his mental images were very old, the Titan\n> general still remembered Barbarossa in his human form.

Jayther gave himself over entirely to\n> the task\n>\n> until he understood precisely how to manipulate sophisticated\n> programming for the rebels' purposes. Implanting humanlike ambitions\n> and goals into the computer network, he had made the machines *want*\n> to participate in the takeover.\n>\n> Later, though, Omnius had developed ambitions of his own.\n>\n> A man of tremendous foresight, Jayther had included fail-safe\n> instructions that precluded the thinking machines from harming any of\n> the Titans. Agamemnon and all of his compatriots were alive only\n> because of Vilhelm Jayther--- Barbarossa.\n>\n> Now the Sorceresses had killed him. The realization kept pounding\n> inside Agamemnon's brain, building his anger.\n>\n> \"We cannot let this outrage go unpunished,\" Ajax said. \"I say we go to\n> Rossak, slay all the women, and turn their world into a charred ball.\"\n>\n> \"Dear Ajax,\" Juno said sweetly, \"need I remind you that just *one* of\n> those Sorceresses destroyed Barbarossa and all the neo-cymeks with\n> him?\"\n>\n> \"So?\" Ajax's voice swelled with pride. \"Single-handedly, I\n> exterminated the human infestation on Walgis. Together, we can handle\n> a few Sorceresses.\"\n>\n> In a sharp tone Agamemnon said, \"The rebels on Walgis were already\n> broken before you started slaughtering them, Ajax. These Sorceresses\n> are different.\"\n>\n> Dante said, in a droning voice, \"Omnius will never authorize a\n> full-scale strike. The expenditure in resources would be too great. I\n> have completed a preliminary analysis.\"\n>\n> \"Nevertheless,\" Agamemnon said, \"it would be an extreme tactical\n> mistake to allow this defeat to go unchallenged.\"\n>\n> After a few moments of uneasy silence, Xerxes said, \"Since so few of\n> us remain, the Titans should never, never attack together. Think of\n> the risk.\"\n>\n> \"But if we go together to Rossak and crush the Sorceresses, then the\n> threat will be over,\" Ajax said.\n>\n> Juno made a hissing sound, then said, \"I see your brain there in the\n> jar, Ajax, but you don't seem to be using it. Perhaps you should\n> change your electrafluid? The Sorceresses have proven they can destroy\n> us, and you want to go blundering into the greatest threat the cymeks\n> have ever faced, like sheep baring our throats for slaughter?\"\n>\n> \"We could bring enough robot ships to attack from orbit,\" Dante said.\n> \"We need not risk ourselves.\"\n>\n> \"This is personal,\" Ajax growled. \"One of the Titans has been\n> assassinated. We don't just toss missiles from the other side of the\n> planetary system. That is the coward's way . . . even if the thinking\n> machines call it *efficient*.\"\n>\n> \"There is room for compromise,\" Agamemnon said. \"Juno, Xerxes, and I\n> can gather neo-cymeks as volunteers and go in with a robot fleet. That\n> should be enough to inflict immense damage on Rossak.\"\n>\n> \"But I can't go, Agamemnon,\" Xerxes said. \"I am working here with\n> Dante. Our greatest monuments in the Forum Plaza are nearly completed.\n> We've just begun work on a new statue to Barbarossa.\"\n>\n> \"Good timing,\" Juno said. \"I'm sure he appreciates it, now that he's\n> dead.\"\n>\n> \"Xerxes is right,\" Dante said. \"There is also the immense frieze of\n> the Victory of the Titans being laid out and constructed on the\n> hillside near the center of the metropolitan grid.

Xavier Harkonnen knew military\n> tactics and strategies, had planned to devote his life to service in\n> the Salusan Militia and the League Armada. But now he had no choice\n> but to speak before the gathered League representatives in the Hall of\n> Parliament.\n>\n> After the bittersweet victory on Giedi Prime, some things needed to be\n> said.\n>\n> The old Parliament building had been shored up and repaired, while the\n> remnants of scaffolding and temporary walls marked where\n> reconstruction had not yet been completed. Plazstone, pillars, and\n> mural walls were still marked with cracks and obvious patchwork.\n> Battle scars, badges of honor.\n>\n> Shortly before the young officer's scheduled address, Viceroy Butler\n> had stood beside his stoic wife on the floor of Parliament as they\n> participated in a memorial service for Serena and the fallen comrades\n> in her Giedi Prime rescue mission.\n>\n> \"She died doing exactly what she demanded of herself, and of us,\" the\n> Viceroy said. \"A light has gone out in our lives.\"\n>\n> In the year since the cymek attack on Salusa, the people had endured\n> many funerals and too much grief. But Serena, the fiery young\n> representative, had always insisted that the League serve the people\n> and help those in need.\n>\n> Beside the Viceroy, Livia Butler wore her contemplation robes from the\n> City of Introspection. She had already watched her only son Fredo\n> waste away from his blood disease; now her eldest daughter had been\n> killed by\n>\n> the thinking machines. She had only ethereal young Octa left of her\n> children.\n>\n> Representatives of the League Worlds remained silent and respectful,\n> sharing in the sadness. Despite her youth, Serena Butler had made a\n> lasting impression with her idealism and exuberance. After the formal\n> eulogy many speakers took turns at the podium to praise her acts of\n> generosity.\n>\n> Xavier listened to the tributes. The representatives looked at him\n> compassionately. He thought of the life he and Serena had meant to\n> share.\n>\n> For her sake, though, Xavier had not, and would not, shed tears\n> openly. If the human race wept for all those who had fallen, they\n> would be paralyzed in an unending state of grief. His lips trembled,\n> and his vision blurred, but he forced himself to be strong. It was his\n> duty. Although his heart grieved, Xavier's mind turned to furious\n> thoughts of the enemy, and of traitorous human sympathizers who fought\n> beside the robots.\n>\n> His memory of Serena would be his constant source of strength and\n> inspiration. Even in death, she would drive him to achievements that\n> he never could have attained without her.

Both men wore silver-and-blue robes\n> and capes, with black headbands in honor of their fallen loved one.\n>\n> It was time for the continuing business of humanity.\n>\n> After his recent military success, he needed little introduction. \"We\n> are human beings, and have always fought for our rights and our\n> dignity. We formed the League of Nobles so that free men could resist\n> the Titans, and after them the thinking machines.

When\n> a beleaguered planet calls for help, the League debates and agonizes\n> for months before we decide on our response--- until it is too late!\n> We saw that on Giedi Prime. Only Serena's folly forced us to act\n> swiftly enough to make a difference. She knew exactly what she was\n> doing, and paid for it with her life.\"\n>\n> When a few of the representatives began to mutter, Xavier's skin grew\n> hot and he silenced them with a booming voice. \"The League of Nobles\n> must form a stronger coalition under streamlined leadership. To be\n> effective against a highly organized computer evermind, we need a\n> closely knit government of humans, better than this loose structure.\"\n> He waved his hands as he spoke.\n>\n> \"As Serena Butler advocated, we must make every effort to secure the\n> cooperation of the Unallied Planets, thus strengthening our defensive\n> framework and adding a buffer zone to our protected territory.\"\n>\n> Viceroy Butler stepped close beside him and added in a voice cracking\n> with emotion, \"That was always my daughter's dream. Now we must make\n> it ours.\"\n>\n> Several uncertain nobles rose in respectful dissent. A lean,\n> hard-looking woman from Kirana III said, \"Bringing so many worlds\n> together under tight rule, especially in a military guise, reminds me\n> of the Time of Titans.\"\n>\n> A small-statured nobleman from Hagal shouted, \"No more empires!\"\n>\n> Xavier raised his own voice. \"Isn't an empire better than\n> *extinction*? While you worry about political nuances, Omnius is\n> conquering star systems!\"\n>\n> But another said, \"For centuries the League of Nobles and Synchronized\n> Worlds have held each other at bay, in an uneasy equilibrium.

One day, I believe we must go on the\n> *offensive*! It is the only way we can win this conflict.\"\n>\n> Gradually, the assemblage understood that Xavier had intentionally\n> provoked a reaction. With a polished boot, he kicked broken debris off\n> the stage. \"Experience is our best teacher.

He had\n> shamed them into a show of boisterous support, and the voices of\n> dissent--- for now--- remained subdued.\n>\n> Unbidden tears ran down his face, and he tasted salt on his lips.\n> Drained of emotion and energy, he noticed Viceroy Butler looking\n> proudly at him, as if the young man were his son.\n>\n> *I am assuming the mantle of Serena*, Xavier realized, *doing what she\n> would have done.*\n>\n> *As if to balance the pain and suffering, War has also been the\n> breeding ground for some of our greatest dreams and accomplishments.*\n\n--- HOLTZMAN,\n\nacceptance speech, Poritrin Medal of Valor\n\n> **B**lindly confident, Tio Holtzman plunged ahead with his new idea,\n> making Norma Cenva feel like chaff in a gusting wind.

Instinct spoke to her like a nagging voice, but\n> she kept her worries to herself. After Holtzman's sour reaction to her\n> initial reservations, he had not asked for her opinion again.\n>\n> Norma hoped that she was mistaken. She was *human*, after all, and far\n> from perfect.\n\nWhile the Savant busied himself inside the domed demonstration\nlaboratory\n\n> --- a theater-sized structure atop an adjoining bluff--- Norma kept to\n> the sidelines. Even her most innocent participation made him nervous,\n> as if he put more stock in her doubts than he admitted aloud.\n>\n> Now she stood on the span of the bridge between bluff sections and\n> reached up to grab the rail. Listening to breezes hum through the\n> cables, she peered through safety netting at the river traffic far\n> below.\n>\n> She heard Holtzman inside the domed demo-lab, shouting to slaves as\n> they erected a bulky generator that produced a resonating field\n> intended to shake apart and melt a metal form. An imperious presence\n> in a white-and-purple robe, he wore chains of office about his neck,\n> baubles that signified his scientific awards and achievements.\n> Holtzman glared at his workers, then paced around, double-checking,\n> watching every detail.\n>\n> Lord Bludd and a handful of Poritrin nobles would join them to watch\n> the day's test, so Norma understood Holtzman's anxiety. She herself\n> would never have made such an extravagant presentation of an untried\n> device, but the scientist did not show even a glimmer of doubt.\n>\n> \"Norma, please assist me in here,\" Holtzman called in an exasperated\n> tone. On short legs she ran from the bridge into the enclosure. He\n> gestured disgustedly toward the slaves. \"They don't understand a thing\n> I've told them to do. Supervise them, so I can test the calibration.\"\n>\n> At the center of the reinforced chamber, Holtzman's crew had erected a\n> metal mannequin that had the vague features of a combat robot. Norma\n> had never seen a real thinking machine, but had scrutinized many\n> stored images. She stared at the mockup. This was the enemy, the true\n> foe against which all of her work must be directed.\n>\n> She looked at her mentor with more compassion, understanding his\n> desperation. Holtzman was morally obligated to pursue *any* idea, to\n> find *any* way to continue this noble fight. He had a good feel for\n> projected energies, distortion fields, and nonprojectile weaponry. She\n> hoped his alloy-resonance generator would work after all.\n>\n> Before the slaves had finished rigging the test apparatus, a commotion\n> occurred outside the main house. Ribbon-festooned ceremonial barges\n> came into view above the cliffs, where Holtzman's balconies overlooked\n> the river. Scale-armored Dragoon guards stood on the flying craft with\n> Lord Bludd, along with five senators and a black-robed court\n> historian.\n>\n> Holtzman dropped what he was doing. \"Norma, finish this. Please!\"\n> Without looking back at her, he rushed across the connecting bridge to\n> greet his prestigious visitors.\n>\n> Norma urged the slaves to hurry, as she personally adjusted the\n> calibrations and attuned the apparatus to the inventor's\n> specifications. Light shone through high skylights to illuminate the\n> robot facsimile. Reinforced metal ceiling beams crisscrossed the\n> overhead vault, supporting pulleys and\n>\n> winches that had been used to haul the blockish resonance generator\n> into place.\n>\n> Moody Zenshiite slaves milled about, wearing traditional clothing,\n> red-and-white stripes wrapped around serviceable gray jumpsuits. Many\n> slave owners didn't allow their captives to show signs of\n> individuality, but Holtzman didn't care one way or the other.

One black-bearded, shadowy-eyed man\n> spoke to them in a language unfamiliar to Norma. Moments later a\n> grinning Holtzman ushered his impressive guests into the demonstration\n> area.\n>\n> The Savant made a grand entrance. At his side, Niko Bludd wore a\n> billowing azure tunic and a scarlet doublet fastened across his barrel\n> chest. His reddish beard had been curled in neat ringlets. Small\n> tattooed circles looked like bubbles at the far points of each eyelid.\n>\n> Walking past the slaves, Bludd noticed Norma and gave the diminutive\n> woman a smile that was both condescending and paternal. Norma bent in\n> a formal bow and politely grasped his slick, lotioned hand.\n>\n> \"We know your time is valuable, Lord Bludd. Therefore, everything has\n> been prepared.\" Holtzman folded his hands. \"This new device has never\n> been tested, and in today's presentation you will be the first to\n> witness its potential.\"\n>\n> Bludd's voice was deep, but musical. \"We always expect the best from\n> you, Tio. If thinking machines have nightmares, no doubt you are in\n> them.\"\n>\n> The entourage chuckled, and Holtzman did his best to blush. He turned\n> toward the slaves and began issuing orders. A half dozen workers held\n> data-recording devices, positioned at important points around the\n> robot mockup.\n>\n> Plush chairs from the main residence had been arranged as seats of\n> honor. Holtzman sat beside Lord Bludd, and Norma was forced to stand\n> by the\n>\n> door. Her mentor appeared confident and intense, but she knew how\n> worried he really was. A failure today might dim his glory in the eyes\n> of the politically powerful nobles on Poritrin.\n>\n> The esteemed observers sat in their cumbersome chairs. Holtzman stared\n> at the generator setup, glancing around as if offering a quiet prayer.\n> He smiled reassuringly at Norma, then ordered the activation of the\n> prototype.\n>\n> A slave flipped a switch, as he had been taught to do. The bulky\n> generator began to hum, directing its invisible beam toward the robot\n> construction.\n>\n> \"If put to practical use,\" Holtzman said with the faintest of quavers,\n> \"we will find ways to make the generator more compact, more easily\n> installed on small ships.\"\n>\n> \"Or we can just build bigger ships,\" Bludd said, with a deep chortle.\n>\n> The hum grew louder, a vibrating rattle that made Norma's teeth\n> chatter.\n>\n> She noticed a thin sheen of perspiration on Holtzman's brow.\n>\n> \"Look, you can see it already.\" The scientist pointed. The targeted\n> robot began to shake, its metal limbs jostling and torso vibrating.\n> \"The effect will continue to build.\"\n>\n> Bludd was delighted. \"That robot is regretting he ever turned against\n> the human race, isn't he!\"\n>\n> The facsimile robot began to shimmer cherry red, its metal heating up\n> as the alloys were attuned to the destructive field projected upon it.\n> Glowing brighter, it shifted to yellow mixed with patches of blinding\n> white.\n>\n> \"By now, a real robot would have been destroyed internally,\" Holtzman\n> said, finally looking content.\n>\n> Abruptly the laboratory's heavy ceiling girders started to rattle, a\n> secondary resonance fed from the targeted robot into the dome's\n> structural framework.\n>\n> The thick walls rumbled and shuddered. A high-pitched hum shrieked\n> through the structure.\n>\n> Norma cried, \"The resonance field is bleeding over.\"\n>\n> Ceiling girders clenched like angry snakes. A crack opened in the\n> dome.\n>\n> \"Shut it off!\" Holtzman shouted, but the terrified slaves scrambled to\n> a corner of the room, as far from the generator as they could get.\n>\n> The robot mockup undulated and twisted, its body core melting. Support\n> struts that held it inside the targeting zone buckled. The\n> ominous-looking combat machine lurched forward then abruptly fell and\n> shattered into blackened metal.\n>\n> Holtzman grabbed Niko Bludd's sleeve. \"My Lord, please hurry across\n> the bridge to my main quarters. We seem to have a . . . slight\n> problem.\"\n>\n> The other nobles were already pelting across the high-tension bridge.\n> Norma was swept along with them. She took one look behind her and saw\n> that the Zenshiite slaves were uncertain what to do. Tio Holtzman gave\n> them no guidance as he retreated over the walkway right behind Bludd.\n>\n> From safety, Norma watched six panicked slaves stumble onto the\n> bridge. Remaining behind, the dark-haired leader pushed them forward,\n> shouting in their odd language. The walkway began to whip up and down\n> as resonance from the projector coupled to the bridge's connecting\n> metal.\n>\n> The bearded Zenshiite leader howled at them again. Norma wished she\n> could rescue those unfortunate, confused people. Couldn't the Dragoon\n> guards do anything? Holtzman remained speechless on this side of the\n> bluff, paralyzed with shock.\n>\n> Before the first batch of slaves could cross, the suspension walkway\n> snapped in the middle, dropping open in a screeching groan of agonized\n> metal. The hapless victims plummeted two hundred meters to the base of\n> the bluff and into the river.\n>\n> Standing on the threshold, separated now by the gulf between the\n> cliffs, the black-bearded leader cursed again. Behind him, a section\n> of the vaulted roof crashed down, destroying the prototype generator\n> and finally stopping the relentless pulse.\n>\n> Dust settled. A few flames and a curl of smoke rose into the air\n> amidst the wailing of injured men still trapped within the collapsed\n> building.\n>\n> Norma felt sick. Beside her, Holtzman sweated profusely and lookedill.\n> He blinked again and again, then wiped his forehead. His skin was\n> gray.\n>\n> In a wry voice, Bludd said, \"Not one of your most successful efforts,\n> Tio.\"\n>\n> \"But you must admit, the concept shows promise, Lord Bludd. Look at\n> the destructive potential,\" Holtzman said, looking at the unruffled\n> nobles without even considering the dead and injured slaves. \"We can\n> be thankful at least that no one was hurt.\"\n\n*Science: The creation of dilemmas by the solution of mysteries.*\n\n--- NORMA CENVA,\n\nunpublished laboratory notebooks\n\n> **I**nside the broken demonstration dome, the bloodstains washed away\n> easily, but deeper scars remained. While a crew of new slaves cleared\n> the rubble, Tio Holtzman crossed a temporary and none-too-sturdy\n> walkway. He looked sadly at the ruins of his laboratory.\n>\n> From where he worked, Bel Moulay, the bearded leader of the Zenshiite\n> slaves, glowered at the callous inventor. He hated the Poritrin man's\n> pale skin, square-cut hair, and arrogantly colorful clothes. The\n> scientist's frivolous badges of honor meant nothing to Bel Moulay, and\n> all the captive Zenshiites were offended that such a useless, deluded\n> man could flaunt his wealth while stepping on the faithful.\n>\n> In a deep voice the bearded leader gave instructions and consolation\n> to his fellows. Moulay had always been more than just the strongest\n> among them; he was also a religious leader, trained on IV Anbus in the\n> strictest laws of the Zenshiite interpretation of Buddislam. He had\n> learned the true scriptures and sutras, had analyzed every passage;\n> the other slaves looked to Bel Moulay to interpret for them.\n>\n> Despite his faith, he was as helpless as his companions, forced to\n> serve at the whim of nonbelievers. The infidels refused to let\n> Zenshiites live according to their strictures, but insisted on\n> dragging them into their hopeless war against the unholy machine\n> demons. It was a terrible punishment, a set of karmic tribulations\n> visited upon them by Buddallah.\n>\n> But they would see it through, and eventually emerge stronger. . . .\n>\n> Under Bel Moulay's guidance, the slaves moved rubble, uncovering the\n> crushed bodies of companions who had worked alongside them, fellow\n>\n> Zenshiites captured when Tlulaxa slavers raided the canyon cities on\n> IV Anbus.\n>\n> Buddallah would eventually show them the way to freedom. At story\n> fires, the bearded leader had promised that the oppressors would be\n> punished--- if not in this generation, then in the next, or the next.\n> But it would happen. A mere man like Bel Moulay had no business trying\n> to hurry the wishes of God.\n>\n> With excited shouts, two slaves shifted a fallen section of wall to\n> uncover a man who still clung to life, though his legs had been\n> crushed and his torso slashed by shards of windowplaz. Preoccupied,\n> Holtzman came over and scrutinized the injured man. \"I am no medical\n> practitioner, but there seems to be little hope.\"\n>\n> Bel Moulay glowered at him with dark, penetrating eyes. \"Nevertheless,\n> we must do what we can,\" he said in Galach. Three Zenshiite workers\n> scooped away the debris and carried the injured man across the rickety\n> walkway. Inside the slave quarters, healers would work on the\n> injuries.\n>\n> After the accident, Holtzman had provided basic medical supplies,\n> though a similar effort had done little to keep a fever from sweeping\n> through the slave population. The scientist supervised the workers in\n> the rubble, but he was intent on his own priorities.\n>\n> With a frown, the Savant gestured impatiently at the slaves picking up\n> chunks of the collapsed ceiling to uncover victims. \"You and you,\n> leave off digging out bodies for now and excavate what's left of my\n> device.\"\n>\n> The sullen captives looked at Moulay for guidance. He simply shook his\n> head. \"There is no value in resistance now,\" he muttered in their\n> private language. \"But I promise you the time will come.\"\n>\n> Later, during their meager sleep time, they would remove their dead\n> and provide proper Zenshiite blessings and passage preparations for\n> the souls. Burning the bodies of the faithful was not something their\n> religion accepted easily, but it was the way of Poritrin.

Moulay hoped to live long\n> enough to see vengeance strike these oppressors, even if it must be in\n> the form of thinking machines.\n>\n> As the demonstration dome was cleared, Holtzman began chattering to\n> himself, planning new experiments and tests.

How much could *he* accomplish in only a\n> meager human lifespan?\n>\n> But Iblis took heart from the words of the Cogitor:*Nothingis\n> impossible*.\n>\n> He flicked open his eyes, intending to gauge the impending sunrise.\n> Instead, he saw a distorted reflection, a curved plexiplaz wall,\n> pinkish organic\n>\n> contours suspended in a container of energy-charged fluid.\n>\n> He sat up abruptly. The Cogitor Eklo rested on the floorboards of his\n> veranda. Beside the canister sat the big monk, Aquim, rocking back and\n> forth, eyes closed, meditating in a semuta trance.\n>\n> \"What are you doing here?\" Iblis demanded in a hushed voice. Fear\n> clenched his throat. \"If the cymeks find you in the camp, they---\"\n>\n> Aquim opened his bleary eyes. \"Trustee humans are not the only ones\n> who have an understanding with the Titans, and with Omnius. Eklo\n> wishes to speak with you directly.\"\n>\n> Swallowing hard, Iblis looked from the enlarged brain suspended in its\n> electrafluid to the haggard-looking monk. \"What does he want?\"\n>\n> \"Eklo wishes to tell you of earlier abortive human revolts.\" Holding a\n> hand against the preservation canister, he stroked the smooth surface,\n> as if picking up vibrations. \"Have you ever heard of the Hrethgir\n> Rebellions?\"\n>\n> Iblis looked around furtively. He saw none of Omnius's watcheyes.\n> \"That isn't the sort of history slaves are allowed to know, even a\n> crew boss at my level.\"\n>\n> The secondary leaned forward, his brows hooded. He spoke of things he\n> had learned, without connecting directly through the electrafluid to\n> the Cogitor's thoughts. \"Bloody rebellions occurred after the Titans\n> had converted themselves to cymeks, but before Omnius awakened.\n> Feeling themselves immortal, the cymeks became exceedingly brutal.\n> Especially the one called Ajax, who was so vicious in his torment of\n> the surviving humans that his mate Hecate left him and disappeared.\"\n>\n> Iblis said, \"Ajax hasn't changed much over the centuries.\"\n>\n> Aquim's red-rimmed eyes glowed. Eklo's brain trembled inside its\n> nutrient solution. \"Because of the excessive brutality of Ajax,\n> oppressed humans began a rebellion, mainly on Walgis but spreading to\n> Corrin and Richese.\n>\n> The slaves rose up and destroyed two of the original Titans, Alexander\n> and Tamerlane.\n>\n> \"The cymeks responded with a swift and decisive crackdown. Ajax took\n> great delight in closing off Walgis and then methodically\n> exterminating every living human there. Billions were slaughtered.\"\n>\n> Iblis struggled to think. This Cogitor had come all the way from his\n> high tower to see him. The magnitude of such a gesture stunned him.\n> \"Are you telling me that a revolt against the machines is possible, or\n> that it is doomed to failure?\"\n>\n> The big monk extended a rough hand to grab Iblis's wrist. \"Eklo will\n> tell you himself.\"\n>\n> Iblis felt a rush of anxiety, but before he could resist, Aquim\n> pressed the work leader's fingertips into the viscous electrafluid\n> surrounding the Cogitor's ancient brain. The slick solution felt icy\n> cold to Iblis, then hot. The skin on his hand tingled, as if a\n> thousand tiny spiders ran along his flesh.\n>\n> Suddenly he could sense thoughts, words, and impressions flowing\n> directly into his mind from Eklo. \"The revolt failed, but oh what a\n> glorious attempt!\"\n>\n> Iblis received another message, this one wordless, but it conveyed\n> meaning nonetheless, like an epiphany. It was as if the majesty of the\n> universe had opened to him, so many things he had not previously\n> understood . . . so many things Omnius kept the slaves from knowing.\n> Feeling great calm, he immersed his hand deeper into the liquid. His\n> fingertips touched the Cogitor's tissue, ever so gently.\n>\n> \"You are not alone.\" Eklo's words reverberated to his very soul. \"I\n> can help. Aquim can help.\"\n>\n> For several moments, Iblis gazed toward the horizon as the golden sun\n> rose, casting light on enslaved Earth. Now he did not view this story\n> of a failed\n>\n> rebellion as a warning, but as a sign of hope. A better-organized\n> revolt might succeed, given proper guidance and proper planning. And\n> the proper leader.\n>\n> Iblis, who had once felt no purpose or direction in his life other\n> than to enjoy the comfort of his position as a trustee of the\n> machines, now sensed a brooding anger within. The revelation brought a\n> fervor to his heart. The monk Aquim seemed to share the same passion\n> behind his semuta-dazed expression.\n>\n> \"Nothing is impossible,\" Eklo repeated.\n>\n> Amazed, Iblis removed his hand from the charged fluid and stared at\n> his fingers. The big monk picked up the Cogitor's brain canister and\n> sealed it.

It is the nature of\n> mankind to strive for things they do not have, to steal the rewards\n> that another person might win. To be envious of another's\n> circumstances.\"\n>\n> He focused his optic threads on the lovely ocean view beyond the\n> filthy slave pens, the churning blue-and-white surf at the base of the\n> slope. He swept his mirrored face up so that he could focus on\n> seagulls in the sky. Such images matched his programmed aesthetics\n> more closely than the dirty, fenced compound.\n>\n> Erasmus continued, \"Your most privileged human beings, such as the\n> current son of Agamemnon, hold the highest position among their kind.\n> They are our reliable pets, occupying a rung between sentient\n> biologicals and thinking machines. From this pool we draw candidates\n> for conversion into neo-cymeks.\"\n>\n> The watcheye buzzed close to the robot's polished head. Through the\n> flying device, Omnius said, \"I know all this.\"\n>\n> Erasmus continued as if he hadn't heard. \"And the caste below the\n> trustees includes civilized and educated humans, skilled thinkers and\n> creators, such as the architects who design the Titans' interminable\n> monuments. We rely on them to perform sophisticated tasks, such as\n> those being completed by artisans and craftsmen at my villa. Just\n> beneath them are my household staff, my cooks, and landscapers.\"\n>\n> The robot scanned the slave pens and realized that such appalling\n> ugliness made him want to go back to his flower gardens to wander\n> among the carefully cultivated species. Serena Butler had already done\n> wonders with the plants. She had an intuitive understanding of\n> gardening.\n>\n> \"Admittedly, those wretches down there in my pens are good for little\n> more than breeding new offspring or for dissection in medical\n> experiments.\"\n>\n> Erasmus was like Serena in a sense: he frequently needed to prune and\n> weed the human race in his own garden.\n>\n> \"I hasten to add,\" the robot said, \"that humankind as a whole is of\n> supreme value to us. Irreplaceable.\"\n>\n> \"I have heard your argument before,\" Omnius mused as the watcheye\n> drifted higher, for a broader view. \"Though machines could perform\n> every task you have enumerated, nevertheless I have accepted the\n> loyalty of my human subjects, and I have granted some of them\n> privileges.\"\n>\n> \"Your arguments do not seem . . .\" Erasmus hesitated, because the word\n> he had in mind would be a supreme insult to a computer. *Logical*.\n>\n> Omnius said, \"All humans, with their strange penchant for religious\n> beliefs and faith in things incomprehensible, should pray that your\n> experiments prove me right about human nature, and not you.

Keep that in mind.\"\n>\n> When she turned away again, Aliid said out of the corner of his mouth,\n> \"And even if we win the war for them, will they free us?\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AT NIGHT IN their communal quarters at the blufftop estate, the slaves\n> were left alone.

The tribal clothing was a symbol of their\n> identity, the white of freedom and the red of blood. Poritrin slave\n> keepers understood none of the symbolism, which was just as well.\n>\n> Bright-eyed, Aliid sat next to Ishmael. \"Listen to Bel Moulay. He will\n> give us hope. He has a plan.\"\n>\n> Ishmael hunkered down. His belly was full with strange, bland food,\n> but it nourished him. As much as he resented his new master, the boy\n> did prefer working here, rather than on the awful mudflats.\n>\n> Bel Moulay called them all to prayer in a firm, gruff voice, then\n> intoned sacred sutras in a language that Ishmael's grandfather had\n> employed, an arcane tongue understood only by the most devout. In that\n> way, they could converse without being understood by eavesdropping\n> masters.\n>\n> \"Our people have waited for vengeance,\" Moulay said. \"We were free,\n> then captured. Some of us are new slaves, while others have served the\n> evil men for generations.\" His eyes were fiery, his teeth very white\n> against dark lips and a black beard. \"But God has given us our minds\n> and our belief. It is up to us to find the weapons and the necessary\n> resolve.\"\n>\n> The muttering among the Zenshiites made Ishmael uncomfortable.\n>\n> Bel Moulay seemed to be advocating outright revolt, a violent uprising\n> against the masters. To Ishmael, that did not seem what Buddallah\n> would have preached.\n>\n> Sitting together, the IV Anbus slaves made whispered threats of\n> retribution. Moulay talked of the disastrous alloy-resonator test that\n> had caused the deaths of seventeen innocent slaves.\n>\n> \"We have suffered countless indignities,\" Moulay said. The slaves\n> growled their agreement. \"We do everything our masters require of us.\n> They reap the benefits of what we accomplish, but the Zenshiites\"---\n> he looked quickly at Ishmael and the other new additions to the\n> group---\"as well as our Zensunni brothers, never attain our freedom.\"\n> He leaned forward as if dark thoughts were coursing his mind. \"The\n> answer is in our grasp.\"\n>\n> Ishmael remembered that his grandfather had taught philosophical and\n> nonviolent methods of solving problems. Even so, old Weyop had been\n> unable to save his villagers. The pacifistic Zensunni ways had failed\n> them all, at a time of utmost crisis.\n>\n> Bel Moulay raised a callused fist, as if he intended to thrust it into\n> the crackling fire. \"We have been told by men who call themselves\n> 'righteous slavers' that they have no compunction against pressing\n> *our people* into work. They claim we owe a debt to humanity because\n> we refused to participate in their foolish war against the machine\n> demons--- demons that they had created and thought they controlled.\n> But after centuries of oppression, the people of Poritrin owe *us*.\n> And that is a debt which must be paid in blood.\"\n>\n> Aliid cheered, but beside him Ishmael sat uneasily. He did not agree\n> with the approach, but was unable to offer an alternative. Since he\n> was only a boy, he did not speak up or interrupt the meeting.\n>\n> Instead, like his companions, he listened to Bel Moulay. . . .\n>\n> *Thirsty men speak of water, not of women.*\n\n--- Zensunni Fire Poetry from Arrakis\n\n> **F**ar beyond the League Worlds, thousands of uncharted settlements\n> dotted the Unallied Planets, places where forgotten people eked out\n> meager livings.

What's your\n> best drink?\"\n>\n> The bartender gave him a sour smile. \"In mind for something exotic,\n> are you? You think Arrakis might have something to quench your thirst,\n> eh?\"\n>\n> Keedair began to lose patience. \"Do I have to pay extra for the chat,\n> or can I just have my drink? Your most expensive. What is it?\"\n>\n> The bartender laughed. \"That would be water, sir. Water is the most\n> valuable drink on Arrakis.\"\n>\n> The bartender named a price that was higher than Keedair would expect\n> to pay for supercharged spacecraft fuel. \"For *water*? I don't think\n> so.\"\n>\n> He looked around to see if the bartender was having a joke at his\n> expense, but the other customers seemed to accept it. He'd assumed\n> that the clear drinks in small glasses were colorless alcohol, but it\n> really did seem to be water. He noticed an extravagant local merchant\n> whose billowing, colorful clothes and gaudy ornamentation pegged him\n> as a wealthy man. That one even had a few ice cubes floating in his\n> glass.\n>\n> \"Ridiculous,\" Keedair said. \"I know when I'm being cheated.\"\n>\n> The bartender shook his bald head. \"Water's hard to come by around\n> here, sir. I can sell you alcohol cheaper, because Arrakis natives\n> don't want anything that'll dehydrate them further. And a man with too\n> much strong\n>\n> drink in him can make mistakes. You don't pay attention out in the\n> desert and it'll cost you your life.\"\n>\n> In the end, Keedair settled on a fermented substance called \"spice\n> beer,\" potent and pungent with a strong cinnamon bite at the back of\n> his throat. He found the drink exhilarating and ordered a second.\n>\n> While he remained doubtful about the profitability of exploiting\n> Arrakis for slaves, Keedair still felt like celebrating. The success\n> of his run on Harmonthep four months earlier had given him enough\n> credits to live for a year. After that raid, Keedair had hired a new\n> team, never wanting to keep employees around for so long that they\n> grew comfortable and complacent. That wasn't the way a good Tlulaxa\n> businessman managed his affairs. Keedair watched over his work,\n> maintained the details himself, and put tidy profits in his own\n> pockets.\n>\n> He sipped his spice beer again and began to like it even more. \"What's\n> in this stuff?\" When none of the customers seemed interested in\n> conversation, he directed his gaze back at the bartender. \"Is this\n> beer brewed here, or is it an import?\"\n>\n> \"Made on Arrakis, sir.\" When the bartender grinned, his wrinkles\n> folded in upon themselves like a weird origami sculpture made of\n> leather. \"It's brought in by the desert people, Zensunni nomads.\"\n>\n> Keedair's attention perked up at the mention of the Buddislamic sect.\n> \"I'd heard there were a few bands living here in the wastelands. How\n> can I find them?\"\n>\n> \"*Find* them?\" The bartender chuckled. \"Nobody wants to look for them.\n> Dirty, violent folk. They kill strangers.\"\n>\n> Keedair could hardly believe the answer. It took him two tries to\n> formulate his question because the effects of the spice beer had\n> caught him unawares, causing him to slur his words. \"But Zensunni--- I\n> thought they were meek pacifists?\"\n>\n> The bartender emitted a dry cackle. \"Some may be, but these aren't\n> afraid to shed blood to make their point, if you know what I mean.\"\n>\n> \"Are they numerous?\"\n>\n> The bartender scoffed. \"At most, we see only a dozen or two at a time.\n> I'm surprised they're not so inbred that every baby comes out a\n> mutant.\"\n>\n> Keedair's sharp-featured face fell, and he switched his braid to the\n> other shoulder. His plans began to crumble. In addition to the expense\n> of bringing his teams here to Arrakis, his raiders would have to scour\n> the desert just to drag a few sand rats back to market. Keedair sighed\n> and took a long drink of spice beer. Probably not worth the effort.\n> He'd be better off hitting Harmonthep again, even if it made him look\n> bad to other slavers.\n>\n> \"Course, there could be more of them than we realize,\" the bartender\n> said. \"They all look the same wrapped up in desert clothes.\"\n>\n> As Keedair savored the liquor, a tingle went through his body, not\n> quite euphoria, but a rush of well-being. Then an idea lit his mind.\n> He was a businessman, after all, constantly on the lookout for\n> opportunities. It didn't matter where the merchandise came from.\n>\n> \"And what about this spice beer?\" He tapped his nearly empty glass\n> with a stubby fingernail. \"Where do the Zensunnis find ingredients?\n> Doesn't seem to me that anything could grow out there at all.\"\n>\n> \"Spice is a natural substance in the desert. You can find patches out\n> in the dunes, exposed by the wind or spice blows. But monster\n> sandworms live out there, and fierce storms that'll kill you. Let the\n> Zensunnis have the place, if you ask me. The nomads bring in loads of\n> the stuff to Arrakis City, for bartering.\"\n>\n> Keedair considered taking samples of melange back to the League\n> Worlds. Would there be a market for it on rich Salusa, or among the\n> nobles on Poritrin? The substance certainly had an unusual effect on\n> the body . . .\n>\n> soothing in a way he had never experienced before. If he could sell\n> it, he might offset some of the cost of this exploration trip.\n>\n> The bartender nodded toward the door. \"I don't get enough spice beer\n> that I can sell to you as a middleman, but a band of nomads came in\n> this morning. They'll stay inside their tents during the heat of the\n> day, but you'll find them in the market in the evening, on the east\n> end of the spaceport. They'll sell you whatever they have. Just be\n> sure they don't cheat you.\"\n>\n> \"Nobody cheats me,\" Keedair said, revealing his sharp teeth in a cruel\n> grin.\n>\n> He noticed, though, that his words came out alarmingly slurred.\n>\n> He would have to let the spice beer wear off before he met with the\n> Zensunni.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AWNINGS OF BROWN-AND-WHITE fabric offered patches of shade.

A wind came in as the temperature\n> dropped, bringing dust and stinging sand.

Noticing him, two hopeful women\n> went into their stores to haul out items for sale, spreading them on a\n> flat tabletop. One man stood near them, his lean face tattooed with a\n> geometric symbol, his eyes dark and suspicious.\n>\n> Without saying a word, Keedair allowed the women to display their\n> colorful cloths, along with odd-shaped rocks that had been scoured in\n> sandstorms and a few laughably corroded items of long-forgotten\n> technology that Keedair could never sell to even the most gullible and\n> eccentric antique collector. He shook his head gruffly each time until\n> the lean man--- whom one of the women referred to as Naib Dhartha---\n> said he had nothing else.\n>\n> Keedair got to the point. \"I've tasted spice beer. The man who sold it\n> to me suggested I talk to you.\"\n>\n> \"Spice beer,\" Dhartha said. \"Made from melange. Yes, it is\n> obtainable.\" \"How much can you deliver, and what would it cost me?\"\n>\n> The naib spread his hands and revealed a hint of a smile. \"Everything\n> is open to discussion. The price depends on the amount you desire.\n> Enough for a month of personal use?\"\n>\n> \"Why not a cargo ship full?\" Keedair said, noting shock on the faces\n> of the nomads.\n>\n> Dhartha recovered himself quickly. \"That will take time to gather. A\n> month, maybe two.\"\n>\n> \"I can wait--- if we reach an agreement. I've come here with an empty\n> vessel. I need to take something back with me.\" He looked down at the\n> scavenged objects and the wind-scoured art rocks. \"And I certainly\n> don't want to carry anything like *that*. I'd be the laughingstock of\n> the League.\"\n>\n> Despite a natural Tlulaxa interest in biological products, Keedair was\n> not wedded to the business of slavery. He would go his own way and\n> never return to the Thalim solar system, if necessary. Many of the\n> Tlulaxa were religious fanatics anyway, and he grew tired of their\n> dogma and politics. Drugs and drink would always be in demand, and if\n> he could introduce something new and exotic, a drug the richest nobles\n> had never tried, he might turn a handy profit.\n>\n> \"But first tell me exactly what melange is,\" Keedair continued. \"Where\n> does it come from?\"\n>\n> Dhartha gestured to one of the women, who ducked under the sheltered\n> overhang. A hot breeze picked up, and the polymer fabric flapped\n> louder than before. The sun had settled toward the horizon, forcing\n> him to squint as he looked in that direction. This prevented him from\n> reading nuances in the desert man's expression.\n>\n> Within moments, the woman brought out small, steaming cups of a rich\n> black liquid that smelled of pungent cinnamon spice. She served\n> Keedair first, and he looked down, curious but skeptical.\n>\n> \"Coffee mixed with pure melange,\" Dhartha said. \"You will enjoy it.\"\n>\n> Keedair recalled how expensive water had been in the bar and decided\n> that this nomad was investing in their conversation. He took a sip,\n> cautious at first, but could think of no reason why the fellow might\n> poison him. He tasted the hot coffee on his tongue and felt an\n> electric sensation, a delicious taste that reminded him of the spice\n> beer he still had in his system. He would need to be careful, or he\n> would lose his business edge.\n>\n> \"We harvest melange out in the Tanzerouft, the deep desert where the\n> demon sandworms go. It is very dangerous there. We lose many of our\n> people, but the spice is precious.\"\n>\n> Keedair took another drink of coffee and had to stop himself from\n> agreeing too readily. His assessment of the possibilities grew. Now,\n> as the two men shifted positions, Keedair could look upon Dhartha's\n> lean face. The Naib's eyes were not just dark; they were deep blue.\n> Even the whites had taken on a strange indigo tinge. Most odd. He\n> wondered if it could be an unusual defect caused by Zensunni\n> inbreeding.\n>\n> The desert man reached into one of his pockets and withdrew a small\n> box, which he opened to display a compressed, flaky brown powder. He\n> extended it toward Keedair, who stirred the contents with the tip of\n> his little finger.\n>\n> \"Pure melange. Very potent. We use it in our beverages and meals back\n> in the cave villages.\"\n>\n> Keedair touched the spice-speckled tip of his finger to his tongue.\n> The melange was strong and exhilarating, yet soothing. He felt\n> energetic and calm at the same time. His mind seemed sharper, not\n> fuzzed the way excessive alcohol or drugs affected him. But he held\n> back, not wishing to appear overly anxious.\n>\n> \"And if you consume melange over a long period of time,\" Dhartha was\n> saying, \"it helps you retain your health, keeps you young.\"\n>\n> Keedair made no comment. He had heard similar claims about various\n> \"fountain of youth\" substances. None of them, in his experience, had\n> ever proven effective.\n>\n> He snicked shut the cover of the small box and put it in his own\n> pocket, though it had not been offered to him as a gift. He stood. \"I\n> will come back tomorrow. Then we shall talk more. I need to consider\n> this matter.\"\n>\n> The desert naib grunted in affirmation.\n>\n> Keedair walked toward his shuttle within the parking perimeter of the\n> spaceport. His mind spun with preliminary calculations. His fellow\n> slavers would be disappointed at not even attempting a raid, but\n> Keedair would pay them the minimum required by contract. He needed to\n> ponder the possibilities of this potent spice before discussing a\n> price with the nomads. Arrakis was far, far from normal space trading\n> routes. The idea excited him, but he wasn't certain he could\n> profitably export the exotic substance.\n>\n> Realistically, he doubted if melange would ever be more than a mere\n> curiosity.\n>\n> *Humans are survivors.

He had\n> furnished this room for his business meetings with drug prospectors,\n> biochemists, and pharmaceutical merchants, but Zufa Cenva sometimes\n> used it for her own private meetings.\n>\n> Even in the late darkness, the chief Sorceress was out in the\n> dangerous jungles, training her young prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and preparing them for\n> suicide attacks. Venport did not know whether Zufa was eager or afraid\n> for her volunteers to be called again.\n>\n> He very much hoped his mate didn't get ideas of her own, though she\n> would probably love to make herself a martyr. Zufa took him for\n> granted, blamed him for his imagined failings, but still Venport cared\n> for the cold, pale Sorceress. He didn't want to lose her.\n>\n> Zufa had been due back more than an hour ago, and he'd been waiting\n> for her. It did him no good to be impatient, though. The haughty\n> Sorceress operated on her own schedule, considering his priorities\n> unimportant.\n>\n> Even in the darkest night, the cave room was illuminated by warm,\n> comforting light--- a glowing yellow sphere that floated gracefully\n> above the table like a portable, personal sun. Dear Norma had sent it\n> to him from Poritrin as a gift, a compact light source levitated by a\n> new suspensor field she had developed. Based on the same principle as\n> a glowpanel, but much more efficient, the device generated\n> illumination as a by-product of the suspensor field itself. Norma\n> called it a glowglobe, and he'd been considering its commercial\n> possibilities.\n>\n> Venport took a long drink of bitter herbal ale from a goblet in front\n> of him. He grimaced, then drank some more, trying to bolster his\n> nerve. Zufa should be here any minute, and he was anxious to see her.\n> Out in the jungles the Sorceresses had erected a shrine to honor\n> fallen Heoma. Maybe they were all there now, dancing around it under\n> the starlight, chanting incantations like witches. Or maybe--- despite\n> their cool, agnostic logic and determination--- they chose private\n> moments to worship a Gaia life force, an Earth mother that embodied\n> feminine power.

The nocturnal insects had a voracious appetite for human\n> blood, but only men were bothered. It was one of the jokes of Rossak,\n> as if the Sorceresses had cast some sort of a spell on the tiny\n> creatures to keep their men inside during the evenings, while women\n> performed secret rites out in the jungles.\n>\n> Another quarter of an hour passed, and still Zufa did not join him.\n> Frustrated with her, Venport finished the ale and set the empty goblet\n> on the opalwood table, heaving a disgusted sigh. He rarely asked to\n> see her, but this was important to him. Couldn't she give him just a\n> few moments of her precious time?\n>\n> Still, he would continue to seek her understanding and respect. For\n> years, Venport had enjoyed substantial success in exporting medical\n> narcotics and pharmaceuticals manufactured from Rossak plants. In the\n> past month, his men had turned a large profit from the sale of\n> psychedelics to Yardin. The drugs had become a favorite of the\n> Buddislamic mystics who ran the place.

A smuggler\n> from Buzzell, one of the Unallied Planets, had sold him the extremely\n> rare and valuable stone. The dealer had claimed that some soostones of\n> extraordinary purity possessed hypnotic focusing abilities. He wanted\n> Zufa\n>\n> to wear it with pride, perhaps on a pendant. The Sorceress could use\n> it to make herself stronger.\n>\n> He inserted a rolled slip of alkaloid bark into his mouth and crunched\n> down, knowing it would make him relax. He dimmed the glowglobe and\n> adjusted its spectrum to a more orange light, which caused the\n> soostone to dance with rainbow colors. The alkaloid bark made him feel\n> tingly, calm . . . and distant. The uncommon stone shimmered\n> hypnotically, and he lost track of time.\n>\n> When Zufa entered the room, her pale face was flushed, her eyes\n> bright. She looked like an ethereal creature in the room's rich glow.\n> She wore a long diaphanous gown with tiny jewels sparkling across it\n> like a field of ruby flowers.\n>\n> \"I see you have nothing important to do,\" she said, already frowning.\n>\n> He gathered his wits about him. \"Nothing more important than waiting\n> for you.\" Rising to his feet with all the pride he could muster, he\n> picked up the soostone. \"I found this, and I thought of you. A gift\n> from Buzzell, where my merchants made an extraordinary profit from---\"\n> Noticing an expression of disdain on her face, Venport felt flustered.\n> His voice trailed off.\n>\n> \"And what am I supposed to do with it?\" She examined the offering,\n> without touching it. \"When have I ever cared for pretty baubles?\"\n>\n> \"It's a rare soostone, said to have certain . . . telepathic\n> enhancement characteristics. Perhaps you can use it as a focusing\n> device when you instruct your trainees?\" She stood like a statue,\n> unimpressed, and he continued in a rush, \"The Buddislamics on Yardin\n> are clamoring for our psychedelics.

If he were a cymek,\n> he could have easily adjusted his internal temperature, and\n> thoughtrodes could delete annoying sensual responses. *Someday*.\n>\n> Inside the entry, a beautiful young woman greeted him. \"Vorian\n> Atreides?\" She had exotic lavender eyes and a flashing independence in\n> contrast to the cowed men in livery. The barest hint of a challenging\n> smile curved her lips. \"So, you are the son of the evil Agamemnon?\"\n>\n> Taken aback, Vor drew himself up. \"My father is a revered general,\n> first among the Titans. His military exploits are legendary.\"\n>\n> \"Or infamous.\" The woman stared at him with a shocking lack of\n> respect.\n>\n> Vor didn't know how to react. Lower-caste humans on the Synchronized\n> Worlds all knew their places, and she couldn't be a trustee, like\n> himself. No other slave had ever spoken to him in such a manner. As a\n> reward after his numerous update missions, Vor had been granted the\n> services of pleasure slaves, women assigned to warm his bed. He had\n> never asked any of them their identities. \"I want to know your name\n> because I wish to remember it,\" he said, at last. He found something\n> intriguing about this exotically beautiful woman and her unexpected\n> defiance.\n>\n> She sounded as proud of her lineage as Vor was. \"I am Serena Butler.\"\n> She led him along a corridor lined with statuary and paintings, then\n> into a botanical garden shielded from the rain by a glass-paneled\n> ceiling.\n>\n> \"What do you do here? Are you one of Erasmus's . . . privileged\n> trainees?\"\n>\n> \"I am just a house slave, but unlike you, I don't serve the thinking\n> machines by choice.\"\n>\n> He took her comment as a badge of honor. \"Yes, I serve them and\n> proudly. I am helping to achieve the best that is possible for our\n> flawed species.\"\n>\n> \"By collaborating with Omnius, you are a willing traitor to your race.\n> To the free humans, you are as evil as your machine masters. Or hasn't\n> that ever occurred to you before?\"\n>\n> Vor was baffled. The human military commander at Giedi Prime had made\n> similar accusations. \"Evil . . . in what way? Can't you see the good\n> that Omnius has accomplished? It's so obvious. Simply look at the\n> Synchronized Worlds. Every detail is seen to, everything runs\n> smoothly. Why would anyone want to disrupt that?\"\n>\n> Serena gazed at him, as if trying to decide whether he truly meant\n> what he said. Finally, she shook her head. \"You are a fool, a slave\n> who cannot see his chains. It's not worth the effort to convince you.\"\n> Abruptly she turned away from him and marched ahead, leaving him\n> speechless. \"For all your supposed training, you simply don't know any\n> better.\"\n>\n> Before he could think of a suitable response, Vor noticed the\n> independent robot. Garbed in opulent robes, Erasmus stood by a shallow\n> pool, his oval face reflecting the water. Raindrops fell from an\n> opening cut through the glass ceiling, wetting him. Classical music\n> played a soothing melody in the background.\n>\n> Without announcing Vor's arrival, Serena left. Surprised by her\n> rudeness, he stared after her. He admired her face and amber-brown\n> hair, as well as her bearing and obvious intelligence. Her waist was\n> thick, and he wondered if\n>\n> she was pregnant. Paradoxically, her arrogance made her more\n> captivating, the desirability of something unattainable.\n>\n> Obviously, Serena Butler had not accepted her place as a household\n> servant. Considering the squalid lives of slaves in the unkempt pens\n> behind the villa, what did she have to complain about? It made no\n> sense.\n>\n> \"Outspoken, is she not?\" said Erasmus, still standing in the rain. The\n> robot shifted his pliable face into a congenial smile.\n>\n> Standing away from the cool drizzle, Vor said, \"I am surprised you\n> tolerate her annoying attitude.\"\n>\n> \"Attitudes can be enlightening.\" Erasmus turned back to his study of\n> the raindrops in the reflecting pool. \"I find her interesting.\n> Refreshingly honest\n>\n> --- much as you are.\" The robot took a step toward him. \"I have\n> reached an impasse in my study of human behavior because most of my\n> subjects are drawn from docile captives who have been bred to slavery.\n> They have never known any life but one of service and subjugation, and\n> do not show any *spark*. They are sheep, while you, Vorian Atreides,\n> are a wolf. And so is this Serena Butler . . . in her own way.\"\n>\n> The visitor bowed, swelling with pride. \"I am happy to assist you in\n> any manner, Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \"I trust you enjoyed the coach ride? I breed the stallions and keep\n> them groomed for important occasions. You gave me an excuse to use\n> them.\"\n>\n> \"It was an unusual experience,\" Vor admitted. \"A most . . . archaic\n> mode of transportation.\"\n>\n> \"Come stand here in the rain with me.\" Erasmus beckoned with a\n> synthetic hand. \"It is pleasant, I assure you.\"\n>\n> Vor stepped forward as he was told, trying not to show discomfort. The\n> rain quickly soaked his tunic, moistened his bare arms; water trickled\n> from his\n>\n> clumped dark hair, down his forehead and into his eyes. \"Yes, Erasmus.\n> It's . . . pleasant.\"\n>\n> The robot simulated a laugh. \"You are lying.\"\n>\n> With good humor, Vor said, \"It is what humans do best.\"\n>\n> Mercifully, the robot led them out of the rain. \"Let us discuss\n> Serena. She is attractive, according to human standards of beauty, is\n> she not?\" Vor didn't know what to say, but Erasmus pressed him, \"I\n> watched you with her. You would like to procreate with that feral\n> human, would you not? She is currently carrying the child of a\n> *hrethgir* lover, but we will have plenty of time. She is unlike any\n> simple pleasure slave you have been assigned?\"\n>\n> Vor pondered the questions, wondering what the robot really wanted to\n> know. \"Well, she is beautiful . . . and enticing.\"\n>\n> Erasmus made an artificial sound, something like a sigh. \"Sadly,\n> despite my numerous sensitive upgrades, I remain unable to experience\n> sexual activity, at least not in the way a biological male does. I\n> have spent centuries designing upgrades and modifications that might\n> replicate the sensations of ecstasy that even the lowliest human can\n> enjoy. Thus far, there has been little progress. My attempts with\n> female slaves have been alarmingly unsuccessful.\"\n>\n> Strolling along in his fine clothes, Erasmus gestured for Vor to\n> follow him through the greenhouse. As they walked down garden paths,\n> the regal machine identified various plants by name and origin, as if\n> he were lecturing a child or bragging about his knowledge. \"Serena\n> knows a great deal about plants herself. She was something of a\n> horticulturist on Salusa Secundus.\"\n>\n> Vor made polite responses, trying to guess how he could help the\n> robot. He wiped water from his eyes; his damp clothes felt clammy and\n> unpleasant.\n>\n> Finally Erasmus explained why he had summoned the young trustee.\n> \"Vorian Atreides, your father recently gave you a biological\n> life-extension\n>\n> treatment.\" The mechanical face shifted back to a smooth mirror, so as\n> not to give Vor a clue about what he wanted. \"Tell me, how do you\n> *feel* now that you have had centuries added to your lifespan? Surely,\n> it is a great gift from Agamemnon, as significant as his original\n> sperm donation.\"\n>\n> Before Vor could consider the question, Serena entered the greenhouse\n> carrying a silver tea set. She placed the tray with a rough clatter on\n> a polished stone table and poured dark liquid into two cups. She\n> handed one to Vor and one to the robot. Erasmus extruded a fibrous,\n> feathery-tipped probe into the tea, as if tasting it. His mirrored\n> mask shifted into an expression of supreme pleasure. \"Excellent,\n> Serena. A remarkable and interesting flavor!\"\n>\n> Vor did not care for the taste himself; the tea reminded him of bitter\n> chocolate mixed with spoiled fruit juices. Serena seemed amused at his\n> expression.\n>\n> \"It is good?\" Erasmus asked. \"Serena prepared it especially for you. I\n> let her choose an appropriate recipe.\"\n>\n> \"The flavor is . . . unique.\"\n>\n> The robot laughed. \"You are lying again.\"\n>\n> \"No, Erasmus. I am avoiding a direct response.\"\n>\n> Vor saw hostility in Serena's unusual eyes as she looked at him, and\n> he wondered if she had ruined the tea on purpose. Leaving the tray on\n> the stone table, she departed, saying, \"Maybe I should attend a\n> trustee school to learn how to be a better simpering servant.\"\n>\n> Vor watched Serena, surprised that Erasmus ignored her rudeness. \"It\n> amuses me to watch her attempts at resistance, Vorian. Harmless\n> defiance. She knows she can never escape.\" During a moment of silence,\n> the robot continued to study him. \"You did not answer my question\n> about the life extension.\"\n>\n> Now that he'd had time to ponder, Vor said, \"Honestly, I'm not sure\n> how I feel about it. My human body is fragile, easily damaged. Though\n> I am still prone to accidents or sickness, at least I will not grow\n> old and weak.\" Vor thought about all the years remaining to him, like\n> credits to spend. He would live several human lifespans, but becoming\n> a cymek would be so much more important. \"Even so, my extra years are\n> only the blink of an eye compared to the life of a thinking machine\n> such as yourself.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, the blink of an eye, an involuntary human reflex I can\n> understand physically and conceptually. You use it as an inexact\n> metaphor to indicate a brief period of time.\"\n>\n> Noticing watcheye screens on the greenhouse walls, Vor realized that\n> the evermind must be eavesdropping. \"Are you always this curious?\"\n>\n> \"Curiosity is how one learns,\" Erasmus said. \"I inquire because I am\n> inquisitive. That makes sense, does it not? Enlighten me. I would like\n> to speak with you again. You--- and Serena--- can give me an\n> interesting perspective.\"\n>\n> Vor bowed. \"As you wish, Erasmus. However, I must coordinate such\n> visits with my important work for Omnius. Soon the *Dream Voyager*\n> will be repaired and ready to depart on another update run.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, we all work for Omnius.\" Erasmus paused. Overhead, through the\n> murky ceiling of the greenhouse, the rain had stopped, leaving patchy\n> openings of blue sky. \"Think more about mortality and longevity. Come\n> and speak to me again before departing on your next voyage.\"\n>\n> \"I will seek permission to do so, Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> INTRIGUED BY THE fascinating interplay between the two humans, Erasmus\n> summoned Serena again and commanded her to escort their guest back to\n> his coach. She had been outwardly hostile to this son of Agamemnon,\n> while he was clearly interested in her . . . physically? . . .\n>\n> mentally? And how could one tell the difference? Another experiment,\n> perhaps?\n>\n> Even though they had exchanged few words, Vorian found his imagination\n> filled with this young woman. He had never met a female like her, with\n> such self-confident beauty, intelligence, and willingness to speak her\n> mind. Obviously Serena Butler had been raised to value herself as an\n> individual--- much as Erasmus worked hard to perfect his own\n> independence.\n>\n> Reaching the outer doorway of the villa, the young man blurted, \"When\n> is your baby due?\" At the coach, the horses seemed anxious to be off.\n> The uniformed robot driver sat like a statue.\n>\n> Serena's eyes widened with annoyance. She was about to retort that it\n> was none of his business, but she stopped short. Perhaps Vorian\n> Atreides was just the opportunity she had been hoping for. He had\n> information that might help her escape, and he had the trust of the\n> machines. It would be foolish to alienate him from the outset. If she\n> befriended him instead, might she not be able to show him what a free\n> human being could be?\n>\n> She drew a deep breath and smiled uncertainly. \"I'm not prepared to\n> discuss my baby with a complete stranger. But maybe next time you\n> come, we could talk. That might be a place to start.\" There. She had\n> done it.\n>\n> With that, she went inside the villa and carefully shut the door\n> behind her.\n>\n> As she watched the coach from the portico of the towering villa,\n> Serena Butler felt uncertain and confused about this deluded man who\n> so proudly served the machines. She didn't like him, wasn't sure she\n> could ever trust him. But perhaps he could be helpful.\n>\n> Feeling uneasy, and damp from the rain and mist in the outside air,\n> she hurried back inside to dry herself and change her clothes. With\n> the precious baby growing inside her womb, six months along now, she\n> thought of her beloved Xavier. Could Vorian help her return to him, or\n> would her child grow up in captivity, never to know its father?\n\n> *Of all the subjects of human behavior, two are most storied: warfare\n> and love.*\n>\n> --- COGITOR EKLO,\n>\n> *Ruminations on Things Lost*\n>\n> **T**he tragic loss of Serena had left Xavier off course, struggling\n> to regain the momentum of his life. Three months earlier, he had seen\n> the wreckage of her blockade runner floating in the seas of Giedi\n> Prime, and had read the indisputable DNA analysis of the blood samples\n> found inside.\n>\n> He did not claim to understand his feelings, and avoided them by\n> letting his work consume him. At first he had wanted to fling himself\n> recklessly at another machine stronghold, but Serena would have\n> scolded him for that. The thought of her disapproval was the only\n> thing that had stopped him.\n>\n> She had died fighting the inhuman enemy. Xavier needed an anchor to\n> grasp, some form of stability before moving on. For the sake of her\n> memory, the struggle must continue until every thinking machine had\n> been destroyed.\n>\n> Xavier's mind drifted to Octa, the haunting reminder of her sister.\n> Lovely in her own right, she was sensitive and introspective, rather\n> than the goal-driven crusader Serena had been. Still, in subtle ways,\n> the willowy girl reminded him achingly of Serena, in the shape of her\n> mouth and the gentle smile. It was like the echo of a pleasant memory.\n> Xavier found himself torn between staring longingly at Octa and\n> avoiding her entirely.\n>\n> She was there to comfort him when he grieved, gave him space when he\n> needed it, and cheered him when he wanted that. Quietly and gently,\n> Octa was filling a void in his life. Although their relationship\n> remained tranquil and unremarkable, she showed him attentive love.\n> Where Serena had been a storm of emotions, her sister was steady and\n> predictable.\n>\n> One day, on an impulse driven more by grief and longing than common\n> sense, Xavier asked Octa to become his wife. She had looked at him\n> with wide eyes, astonished. \"I am afraid to move, Xavier, to utter a\n> sound, because I must be dreaming.\"\n>\n> He had worn his clean and pressed Armada uniform bearing his new rank\n> insignia as Segundo. Xavier stood straight, his hands clasped, as if\n> addressing a superior officer, rather than asking Octa to join him as\n> his life mate. He had always known that Serena's sister had a girlish,\n> unrealistic infatuation with him, and now he hoped it could grow into\n> genuine love.\n>\n> \"In choosing you to marry me, dear Octa, I can think of no braver way\n> to march forward into the future. It is our best chance to honor\n> Serena's memory.\"\n>\n> The words sounded like a formal speech, but Octa flushed as if they\n> were a magical incantation. Aware that this was the wrong reason to\n> betroth himself to her, Xavier tried to dispel the uneasiness. He had\n> made up his mind and hoped that they could soothe each others' wounds.\n>\n> Both Manion and Livia Butler accepted and encouraged the shifting of\n> Xavier's affections; they even rushed the nuptials. Now the bridge\n> across an emotional chasm had been severed, and they believed the\n> match with Octa would benefit all of them.\n>\n> On the day of his wedding, Xavier searched for an inner peace, doing\n> his best to lock away the portion of his heart that would always\n> belong to Serena. He still longed for the peal of her laugh, for her\n> outspokenness, for the electric touch of her skin. Taking a few\n> private moments, he reviewed his favorite memories of her one by one\n> in his mind, and then, tearfully, set them aside.\n>\n> From now on, gentle Octa would be his wife. He would not hurt the\n> already-fragile girl by wallowing in regrets, or by comparing her to\n> her sister. That would be dishonest and unfair to her.\n>\n> A number of League representatives had gathered at the hilltop Butler\n> estate, where seven months earlier Xavier and Serena had participated\n> in the raucous bristleback hunt. Nearby, in the courtyard, they had\n> held the gala betrothal celebration filled with music and dancing---\n> but ending with the terrible news of Giedi Prime's fall.\n>\n> At Xavier's insistence, the wedding took place inside a new pavilion\n> with vistas of vineyards and olive groves. The fabric structure was so\n> resplendent and intricate in its workmanship that it cost more than a\n> modest house. Out in front, three large banners fluttered in a gentle\n> breeze, designating the households of Butler and Harkonnen, and of\n> Tantor, Xavier's adoptive family. In the valley below, the white\n> buildings of Zimia shone in sunlight, with wide avenues and large\n> administration complexes refurbished in the fourteen months since the\n> cymek attack.\n>\n> The ceremony was small and somber, despite the guests' pretenses and\n> Manion Butler's insistent merriment. New memories would supplant the\n> old ones. Smiling as he had not done in months, the Viceroy strutted\n> from guest to guest under the colorful awnings, tasting punch recipes\n> and sampling the cornucopia of cheeses and wines.\n>\n> The silent bride and groom stood by a small altar at the front of the\n> crowded tent, holding hands. Dressed in the pale-blue gown of\n> traditional Salusan weddings, Octa looked ethereal, lovely and fragile\n> beside him. Her strawberry-blond hair was held neatly in place with\n> pearl-head pins.\n>\n> Some would say this rushed marriage to Serena's sister was a reaction\n> to Xavier's grief, but he knew he was taking the honorable course. He\n> reminded himself a thousand times that Serena would have approved.\n> Together, he and Octa would bring closure to so much pain and sadness.\n>\n> Inside the flower-decked pavilion stood Abbess Livia Butler, her\n> amber-brown hair highlighted by sparkling golden strands. She had come\n> from the City of Introspection to perform the ceremony. Confident and\n> proud, as if she had purged all doubts and sorrow from her mind, Livia\n> looked at the bride and groom, then smiled at her husband. Manion\n> Butler barely fit into\n>\n> his red and gold tuxedo. Soft flesh poked out at the neck and at the\n> ends of the sleeves.\n>\n> A group of players began to strum their balisets. A boy with a sweet\n> tenor voice sang slowly. Beside Xavier, Octa seemed to be in her own\n> dreamy world, not quite certain how to react to the turn of\n> circumstances. She squeezed his hand, and he raised it to his lips and\n> kissed it.\n>\n> Ever since the death of her twin brother Fredo, Octa had developed an\n> ability to shut things out, never overwhelming herself with\n> large-scale concerns but instead preferring smaller tableaux. Such a\n> limited focus might permit her to be happy, and Xavier, too.\n>\n> Tears glistening in his expressive eyes, Viceroy Butler stepped\n> forward to clasp their hands. After a long moment he turned solemnly\n> to his wife, and nodded. Abbess Livia began to intone the ceremony.\n> \"We are here to sing a song of love, a song that has joined men and\n> women since the earliest days of civilization.\"\n>\n> As Octa smiled up at Xavier, he could almost imagine she was Serena,\n> but he drove the troubling image away. He and Octa loved each other in\n> a different way. Their bond grew stronger each time he held her in his\n> arms. Xavier had only to accept the warmth that she readily bestowed\n> on him.\n>\n> Before them, Livia spoke the traditional words, the roots of which\n> extended back to the Panchristian and Buddislamic texts of ancient\n> times. The lilting phrases were beautiful, and Xavier's mind kept\n> expanding outward, thinking forward and backward. The words were\n> infinitely calm and reassuring as Abbess Livia guided the young couple\n> through their vows.\n>\n> Soon everything necessary had been said. As he shared the ritual of\n> love and placed a ring on Octa's finger, Xavier Harkonnen pledged his\n> eternal devotion to her. Not even the thinking machines could tear\n> this relationship apart.\n>\n> *Talk is based on the assumption that you can get somewhere if you\n> keep puttingone word after another.*\n\n--- IBLIS GINJO,\n\nnotes in the margin of a stolen notebook\n\n> **A**jax strode his intimidating walker-form into the Forum Plaza,\n> inspecting every operation, searching for flaws. With his array of\n> optic threads, the Titan scanned the polished colossus that showed his\n> long-forgotten human form. Ajax was frustrated that Iblis Ginjo had\n> maintained such a careful watch that he could find no excuse to impose\n> amusing punishments. . . .\n>\n> In turmoil, Iblis watched for an opportunity of his own. His\n> imagination kept returning to the remarkable things he had learned\n> from the Cogitor Eklo, especially details of the glorious failure of\n> the Hrethgir Rebellions. Ajax personified the brutality and pain of\n> those long-ago battles.\n>\n> Could the Cogitor help Iblis to spread the quiet fires of a brewing\n> revolution? They could learn from the mistakes of the past attempts.\n> Had there ever been a rebel of trustee stature, like Iblis? And how\n> could the secondary Aquim assist him?\n>\n> Despite his subtle investigations, his ability to manipulate\n> conversations and make others unwittingly divulge their secrets, Iblis\n> had not yet found evidence of other resistance groups. Perhaps their\n> leadership was scattered, disorganized, weak. Who had sent him the\n> secret messages--- five in the past three months?\n>\n> The lack of evidence frustrated Iblis, because he wanted to push the\n> uprising forward, now that he had made up his mind. On the other hand,\n> if the dissenters were too easily found, they would have no chance\n> against the organized thinking machines.\n>\n> After pushing his slaves particularly hard and finishing his assigned\n> labors, Iblis asked to take another pilgrimage to Eklo's stone tower.\n> Only the\n>\n> Cogitor could give him the answers he needed. When he spoke with the\n> administrative cymek Dante, showing records that demonstrated his\n> productivity and efficiency, the Titan bureaucrat granted him\n> permission to leave the city grid. Dante made it clear, however, that\n> he didn't understand why a mere work supervisor would be interested in\n> nonproductive philosophical issues. It seemed to go beyond the\n> interests of most trustees. \"It will not benefit you.\"\n>\n> \"I'm sure you are right, Lord Dante . . . but it amuses me.\"\n>\n> Setting out before dawn, Iblis urged the smelly burrhorse into the\n> rocky desert and up the slopes to the monastery. Aquim awaited him at\n> the steep circular stairs to the tower, again looking disheveled and\n> somewhat dazed from semuta. From the first time Iblis had immersed his\n> hand in electrafluid and touched the Cogitor's thoughts, he could not\n> imagine why Aquim wanted to dull his perceptions. Perhaps the complex\n> enlightened thoughts of Eklo were so vast and overwhelming that the\n> big-shouldered secondary needed to dampen the flood of confusing\n> revelations.\n>\n> \"I see you look at me with disapproval,\" Aquim said, peering out\n> through slitted eyelids.\n>\n> \"Oh no,\" Iblis said. Then, realizing he could not get away with lying,\n> he said, \"I was just noticing that you enjoy your semuta.\"\n>\n> The big man smiled and spoke in a voice that slurred slightly. \"To an\n> outsider, it may appear that I have deadened my senses, but semuta\n> permits me to forget my own destructive past, before I was inspired to\n> join Cogitor Eklo. It also enables me to focus on what is really\n> important, ignoring the sensual distractions of the flesh.\"\n>\n> \"I can't picture you as a destructive man.\"\n>\n> \"Oh, but I was. My father fought against enslavement and died in the\n> attempt. Afterward, I sought revenge against the machines, and I was\n> good at it. I led a small band of men, and we . . . damaged some\n> robots. I am sorry to say that we also killed a number of trustee\n> slaves who got in our\n>\n> way, men such as yourself. Then Eklo arranged for my rescue, and for\n> my rehabilitation of sorts. He never told me why he sought me out, or\n> how he made the arrangements. There are many things the Cogitor does\n> not reveal to anyone, not even to me.\"\n>\n> Abruptly, the monk turned and plodded unsteadily up the stairs,\n> leading Iblis to the chamber where the Cogitor lived in a state of\n> eternal contemplation. Standing in the tower room with the\n> color-bathed observation windows, Aquim said, \"Eklo has considered\n> your situation at length. Long ago he watched the changes in humanity\n> after the Titans crushed the Old Empire, but he did nothing. Eklo\n> thought the challenge and adversity would improve the human race by\n> strengthening their minds, forcing them out of their sleepwalking\n> existence.\"\n>\n> The monk wiped a stain from the corner of his mouth. \"By separating\n> their minds from their bodies, the cymek Titans could have become\n> enlightened, like Cogitors. That was Eklo's hope when he assisted\n> Juno. But the Titans never rose above their animal flaws. This\n> weakness enabled Omnius to conquer them, and humanity.\" Aquim stepped\n> toward the translucent brain canister resting on a window shelf. \"Eklo\n> believes you may be able to institute a change.\"\n>\n> Iblis's heart leaped. \"Nothing is impossible.\" But he knew he could\n> not fight the machines by himself, would need to find others to help\n> him. *Many others.*\n>\n> Before the transparent window, Eklo's plexiplaz container glistened in\n> a wash of golden morning sunlight. In the distance, Iblis could see\n> the unending skyline of megaliths and monuments designed by the cymeks\n> and built with human sweat and blood. *Do I really want to see them\n> all crumble to dust?*\n>\n> The crew boss hesitated as he considered the consequences, remembering\n> the billions of victims of the Hrethgir Rebellions on Walgis and other\n> worlds. Then he sensed an intrusion into his thoughts, something\n> bumping against them.\n>\n> Aquim removed the covering of the Cogitor's canister, exposing the\n> nutrient fluid that supported the ancient mind. \"Come, Eklo wishes to\n> make direct contact with you.\"\n>\n> The tank's nutrient solution was like amniotic fluid, tingling with\n> immeasurable mental energy. Tentative, fighting his eagerness to know\n> and learn, Iblis dipped his fingers into the electrafluid, touching\n> the slippery surface of Eklo's brain and unlocking all the thoughts\n> the Cogitor wanted to give him.\n>\n> Aquim stood to one side with a strange expression on his face, part\n> beatific complacence, part envy.\n>\n> \"Neutrality is a delicate balancing act,\" Eklo said directly into\n> Iblis's mind, through the neurelectric contact promulgated by the\n> organic circuitry. \"Long ago, I answered Juno's many questions about\n> how to overthrow the Old Empire. My unbiased answers and advice\n> allowed the Titans to formulate successful plans, and the course of\n> the human race was forever changed. For many centuries I reconsidered\n> what I did.\" The brain seemed to press against Iblis's fingertips. \"It\n> is essential for all Cogitors to maintain absolute neutrality. We must\n> be objective.\"\n>\n> Puzzled, Iblis said, \"Then why are you speaking to me? Why have you\n> raised the possibility that the machines might be overthrown?\"\n>\n> \"In order to reestablish the balance of neutrality,\" Eklo said. \"Once,\n> I inadvertently assisted the Titans, so I must now answer your\n> questions with the same objectivity. In the final analysis, I will\n> have maintained equilibrium.\"\n>\n> Iblis swallowed hard. \"Then you have foreseen where it all ends?\"\n>\n> \"There are endings all around us, and beginnings. You alone can decide\n> where you are on the path.\"\n>\n> As Iblis's thoughts spun, searching for useful questions about machine\n> weaknesses and vulnerabilities, Eklo intruded, \"I cannot provide\n> concrete\n>\n> military or political details, but if you phrase your questions\n> cleverly enough, as Juno did, then you shall have what you need. The\n> art of cleverness is a prime lesson of life. You must outwit the\n> machines, Iblis Ginjo.\"\n>\n> For more than an hour, Eklo guided Iblis. \"I have considered this\n> problem for many centuries, long before you came to me. And if you do\n> not succeed, I shall consider it even longer.\"\n>\n> \"But I can't fail. I must succeed.\"\n>\n> \"It will take more than desire on your part. You must tap into the\n> deepest emotions of the masses.\" Eklo fell silent for several moments.\n>\n> Iblis struggled to comprehend, trying to stretch his thoughts. \"Love,\n> hate, fear? Is that what you mean?\"\n>\n> \"They are components, yes.\"\n>\n> \"Components?\"\n>\n> \"Of religion. The machines are very powerful, and it will take more\n> than a mere political or social uprising to defeat them. The people\n> must coalesce around a powerful idea that goes even deeper, into the\n> very essence of their existence, what it means to be human. You must\n> be more than a trustee, but a visionary leader. Slaves need to rise up\n> in a great holy war against the machines, an unstoppable jihad to\n> overthrow their masters.\"\n>\n> \"A holy war? A jihad? But how can I do that?\"\n>\n> \"I tell you only what I sense, Iblis Ginjo, what I have thought and\n> envisioned. You must go out and discover the rest of the answers for\n> yourself.

This place was\n> clean, comfortable, and warm . . . far more pleasant than the slave\n> barracks on the muddy river delta.\n>\n> The boy should have counted his blessings.\n>\n> But this unwelcome place was not Harmonthep. He missed his small boat,\n> navigating through rivulets in the tall reeds. He especially missed\n> the evenings, when the Zensunni would gather in the central hut on the\n> highest stilts to tell stories, recite fire poetry, or simply listen\n> to his grandfather read comforting sutras.\n>\n> \"I hate this place,\" Aliid said beside him, speaking loudly enough\n> that he drew a scolding glare from Tio Holtzman himself.\n>\n> \"Perhaps you would rather return to the mudflats or the agricultural\n> fields?\"\n>\n> Aliid frowned at his own outburst, but met the scientist's steady\n> gaze. \"I hated those places too,\" he mumbled, but not by way of\n> apology.\n>\n> All work stopped. All eyes were fixed on him.\n>\n> Holtzman shook his head in disbelief. \"I simply do not understand why\n> you people complain about everything. I feed and clothe you, I give\n> you easy assignments that advance the cause of humanity--- and still\n> you want to crawl back to squalid villages and live in disease and\n> filth.\"\n>\n> The inventor looked genuinely angry. \"Don't you understand that\n> thinking machines are out there trying to crush every living person?\n> Just imagine all the humans they slaughtered on Giedi Prime, and no\n> one could stop them! Omnius doesn't care about your religion or your\n> foolish politics against civilization. If they find your little\n> hovels, they will destroy them, burn them to the ground.\"\n>\n> *Just like the Tlulaxa slavers did to my village*, Ishmael thought. He\n> saw Aliid's dark eyes flash and knew that his friend was thinking the\n> same thing.\n>\n> Holtzman shook his head. \"You fanatics have no sense of\n> responsibility. Luckily, it is my job to force it on you.\" He went\n> back to his scribing board, angrily jabbed his fingers at the symbols.\n> \"Here are segments of equations. I need you to solve them. Simple\n> mathematics. *Try* to go through the steps I showed you.\" His gaze\n> narrowed. \"Each correct answer will earn one full share of daily\n> rations. If you make mistakes, you go hungry.\"\n>\n> With a heavy heart, Ishmael turned to the papers and computational\n> devices before him, doing his best to follow the supposedly simple\n> calculations.\n>\n> On Harmonthep, all the children in the marsh village had received a\n> basic education in mathematics, science, and engineering. The elders\n> felt that such knowledge would be important for them, when their\n> civilization rose again and the faithful constructed great cities like\n> those in Zensunni lore. Ishmael's grandfather, like many village\n> elders, also spent time instructing the young people in the sutras, in\n> logical and philosophical conundrums that only the tenets of Buddislam\n> could solve.\n>\n> On Aliid's home of IV Anbus, the closely orbiting moons changed the\n> seasons dramatically, causing the planet to oscillate. Thus, the boy\n> had been taught a different branch of mathematics and astronomy,\n> because the ever-varying calendar affected the floods that roared\n> through polished red rock gorges, where the Zenshiite cities had been\n> erected. Flood management workers required sophisticated calculations\n> to understand the variances. Aliid had learned the techniques in order\n> to help his own people. Here,\n>\n> though, he was forced to assist the overlords who had enslaved him,\n> and he resented it.\n>\n> Aliid's first assignment on Poritrin had been to work the cane\n> harvest. He had labored for weeks hacking at tall reeds, from which\n> sweet juices were turned into sugars or distilled into Poritrin rum.\n> The fibrous cane residue was used to make Poritrin cloth. He had\n> wielded a sharp scythe, chopping down woody stalks that splattered\n> sticky syrups. The stalks were harvested after heavy rains when they\n> were most laden with juices, and heaviest to carry.\n>\n> Toward the end of the cutting season, their master had delivered them\n> all to the slave markets in Starda, after accusing them of starting a\n> suspicious fire in the cane silos and destroying half a season's crop.\n> Aliid told Ishmael of this with a lilting smile, but never confessed\n> to having participated in any outright sabotage.\n>\n> Now, Ishmael bent over his calculations, checking and rechecking his\n> math by sliding bars and moving counters on the calculation device.\n> Already his stomach was growling, since Holtzman--- angry about the\n> many mistakes committed the previous day--- had vowed not to feed the\n> solvers until they proved they could do the work. Most of the slaves\n> grudgingly completed their assignments properly.\n>\n> Several days later, after the new solvers had adequately performed\n> their exercises, Holtzman gave them real work. At first, the inventor\n> let them believe it was merely another test. Ishmael could tell from\n> his expression and agitation, though, that he was counting on these\n> results rather than simply putting the crew through their paces.\n>\n> Aliid worked diligently, but Ishmael noted from his expression that he\n> had something devious in mind. Ishmael wasn't sure he wanted to know\n> what it was.\n>\n> After they had worked on numerical simulations for several more days,\n> Aliid finally leaned over to Ishmael. \"Now it is time to make a few\n> subtle changes,\" he said, grinning. \"Small enough that no one will\n> notice.\"\n>\n> \"We can't do that,\" Ishmael said. \"They'll catch us.\"\n>\n> The dark-haired boy gave an impatient frown. \"Holtzman has already\n> checked our work, so he's not going to redo all the math. Now that he\n> trusts us, he can focus on some other scheme. This is our only chance\n> to get even. Think of all we've suffered.\"\n>\n> Ishmael could not disagree, and after having heard Bel Moulay's talk\n> of bloody rebellion, this seemed like a better way to express their\n> displeasure.\n>\n> \"Look.\" Aliid pointed at the string of equations, and with his stylus\n> made a tiny mark, changing a minus sign to a plus sign, and then moved\n> a decimal point to a different part of the equation. \"Simple enough\n> mistakes, easily excused, but they will yield dramatically different\n> results.\"\n>\n> Ishmael was uneasy. \"I understand how it could harm Holtzman's\n> inventions, but I do not see how this will assist *us*. I'm more\n> concerned with seeing that we go back home.\"\n>\n> Aliid looked at him. \"Ishmael, you know the sutras as well as I,\n> perhaps better. Have you forgotten the one that says, 'When you help\n> your enemy, you harm all the faithful'?\"\n>\n> Ishmael had heard his grandfather utter the phrase, but never before\n> had it meant as much to him. \"All right. But nothing that can appear\n> deliberate.\"\n>\n> \"If I understand anything about this work,\" Aliid said, \"even a small\n> miscalculation will cause plenty of damage.\"\n>\n> *PSYCHOLOGY: The science of inventing words for things that do not\n> exist.*\n\n---ERASMUS,\n\n*Reflections on Sentient Biologicals*\n\n> **I**n the sunny botanical garden of the robot's grandiose villa,\n> Serena Butler snipped dead flowers and leaves, tending plants in their\n> beds and planters. Silently resistant, biding her time, Serena\n> performed her daily tasks like any other slave, but always Erasmus\n> watched her as if she were a pet. He was her captor and jailor.\n>\n> She wore black coveralls, her long, amber brown hair tied back in a\n> ponytail. The work allowed her to think of Xavier, of the promises\n> they had exchanged, of making love in the meadow after the bristleback\n> attack, and again in her plush bed on the night before she had slipped\n> off to Giedi Prime.\n>\n> Each morning Serena went to the robot's flower beds, glad for the\n> chance to think undisturbed about getting away from Earth. Day after\n> day, she kept her eyes open for some way to escape--- the obstacles\n> seemed insurmountable--- or a means to cause significant harm to the\n> thinking machines, despite the fact that sabotage would undoubtedly\n> cost her life, and her unborn baby's. Could she do that to Xavier?\n>\n> She couldn't imagine the grief he must be going through. Somehow she\n> would find a way back to him. She owed it to him, to herself, and to\n> their baby. She had hoped to have Xavier hold her hand as she\n> delivered their child. He should have been her husband by now, their\n> lives intertwined in a union stronger than the sum of their\n> individualities, a bastion to stand against the thinking machines.\n>\n> He didn't even know she was still alive.\n>\n> She stroked her curved belly. Serena felt the child growing within her\n> and was filled with foreboding. Two more months and the baby was\n> due--- what did Erasmus mean to do, once the child was born? She had\n> seen the locked doors to the ominous laboratories, had looked with\n> revulsion and horror at the filthy slave pens.\n>\n> And yet, the robot kept her busy with flowers.\n>\n> Erasmus often stood motionless beside her as she worked, his oval face\n> unreadable as he challenged her to debates. \"Understanding starts at\n> the beginning,\" he had said. \"I must build a foundation before I can\n> comprehend everything.\"\n>\n> \"But how will you use that knowledge?\" She yanked out a weed. \"Will\n> you think of more extravagant ways to inflict misery and pain?\"\n>\n> The robot paused, his burnished face a mirror that reflected a\n> distorted image of her own face. \"That is . . . not my objective.\"\n>\n> \"Then why do you keep so many slaves in such terrible conditions? If\n> you don't intend to cause misery, why not give them a clean place to\n> live? Why not provide them with better food, education, and care?\"\n>\n> \"It is not necessary.\"\n>\n> \"Maybe not to you,\" she said, surprised at her boldness. \"But they\n> would be happier and able to do better work.\"\n>\n> Serena had watched how Erasmus lived in magnificent luxury--- an\n> affectation, since no robot could require such things--- yet the\n> household slaves, especially those in the horrible communal pens,\n> existed in filth and fear. Whether or not she remained a captive here,\n> she might be able to improve their lot. If nothing else, she would\n> consider it a victory against the machines.\n>\n> She continued, \"It would take a truly . . . sophisticated thinking\n> machine to understand that improving the slaves' quality of life would\n> improve their\n>\n> productivity, and thus benefit their master as well. The slaves could\n> clean and maintain their own pens if they had the most minor\n> supplies.\"\n>\n> \"I will consider it. Provide me with a detailed list.\"\n>\n> Then, after giving him her suggestions, Serena had not seen the robot\n> for two days. Machine sentinels tended the workers in the villa, while\n> Erasmus himself vanished into his laboratories.\n>\n> She could hear nothing through the soundproofed barriers, though the\n> foul odors and disappearing people left her wondering. Finally,\n> another slave told her, \"You don't want to know what goes on in there.\n> Just be thankful you aren't required to clean up afterward.\"\n>\n> Now, Serena worked her hands in the loamy earth while listening to the\n> soothing classical music that Erasmus constantly played. Her back\n> ached and her joints swelled from the advancing pregnancy, but she did\n> not slacken her efforts.\n>\n> Erasmus approached so silently that she did not notice him until she\n> looked up from her plants to see his mirror-smooth face nested in a\n> frilly antique collar. She stood quickly to hide her startled reaction\n> and wiped her hands on her coveralls. \"Do you learn more by spying on\n> me?\"\n>\n> \"I can spy on you anytime I like. I learn a great deal from the\n> questions I ask.\" His shifting metallic-polymer film changed his face\n> into a frozen expression of dancing mirth. \"Now, I would like you to\n> select the flower you consider the most beautiful of all. I am curious\n> to see your response.\"\n>\n> Erasmus had played such games before. He seemed unable to understand\n> subjective decisions, wishing to quantify matters of opinion and\n> personal taste. \"Each plant is beautiful in its own way,\" she said.\n>\n> \"Nevertheless, choose one. Then explain your choice to me.\"\n>\n> She wandered down the dirt paths, looking from side to side. Erasmus\n> followed her, recording every time she hesitated at a blossom.\n>\n> \"There are observable characteristics, such as color, shape, and\n> delicacy,\" the robot said, \"and more esoteric variables such as the\n> perfume scent.\"\n>\n> \"Don't overlook the emotional component.\" Wistfulness tinged her\n> voice. \"Some of these plants remind me of my home on Salusa Secundus.\n> Certain flowers might have a greater sentimental value for me, though\n> not necessarily for anyone else. Maybe I remember a time when the man\n> I love gave me a bouquet. You wouldn't understand such associations,\n> however.\"\n>\n> \"You are stalling. Make your selection.\"\n>\n> She pointed to an immense elephant flower with bright streaks of\n> shimmering orange and red, highlighted by a horn-shaped stigma at the\n> center. \"Right now, this one is the most beautiful.\"\n>\n> \"Why?\"\n>\n> \"My mother used to grow these at our home. As a child, I never thought\n> them particularly pretty, but now they are a reminder of the happier\n> days--- before I met *you*.\" She immediately regretted her honesty,\n> because it revealed too much about her private thoughts.\n>\n> \"Very good, very good.\" The cognizant machine ignored her insult and\n> stared at the elephant flower, as if analyzing all aspects with his\n> full set of sensor capabilities. Like a wine connoisseur, he tried to\n> describe the merits of its scent, but to Serena his analysis sounded\n> clinical, lacking the subtleties and emotional layering that had\n> prompted her own selection.\n>\n> Strangest of all, Erasmus seemed aware of his own failing. \"I know\n> that humans are in some ways more sensitive than machines---*for now*.\n> However, machines have more potential to become superior in every\n> area. This is why I wish to understand all aspects of sentient\n> biological life.\"\n>\n> With an involuntary shudder, Serena thought of his sealed\n> laboratories, and knew from every indication that his secret\n> activities went far beyond the study of beautiful flowers.\n>\n> Erasmus assumed she was interested in his observations. \"If properly\n> developed, a thinking machine could be more perfect intellectually,\n> creatively, and spiritually than a human could ever hope to be, with\n> unparalleled mental freedom and range. I am inspired by the marvels we\n> could accomplish, if only Omnius did not exert such pressure on other\n> machines to conform.\"\n>\n> Serena listened, hoping he would let more information slip. Did she\n> sense a potential conflict between Erasmus and the computer evermind?\n>\n> The robot continued, \"Capacity for information is the key. Machines\n> will absorb not only more raw data, but more *feelings*, as soon as we\n> understand them. When that happens we will be able to love and hate\n> far more passionately than humans. Our music will be greater, our\n> paintings more magnificent. Once we achieve complete self-awareness,\n> thinking machines will create the greatest renaissance in history.\"\n>\n> Serena frowned at his assertions. \"You can keep improving yourself,\n> Erasmus, but we human beings use only small portions of our brains. We\n> have an enormous potential to develop new abilities. Your capacity for\n> learning is no greater than ours.\"\n>\n> The robot froze in place, as if startled. \"Quite right. How could I\n> have missed that important detail?\" His face shifted, becoming passive\n> and contemplative, then metamorphosed into a broad smile. \"The road to\n> improvement will be a long one. This will require more investigation.\"\n>\n> Abruptly he changed the subject, as if to emphasize her vulnerability.\n> \"What about your baby? Tell me the emotions you feel toward its father\n> and describe the physical act of copulation.\"\n>\n> Trying to stop the flood of painful recollections, Serena remained\n> silent. Erasmus found her reluctance fascinating. \"And are you\n> physically attracted to Vorian Atreides? I have run tests on the\n> handsome young man--- he is fine breeding stock. After your pregnancy\n> is finished, would you like to mate with him?\"\n>\n> Serena took an agitated breath, fixing her mind on memories of Xavier.\n> \"*Mate*? Regardless of how much you study us, there are many things\n> your machine brain will never understand about human nature.\"\n>\n> \"We shall see about that,\" he said, calmly.\n>\n> *Consciousness and logic are not reliable standards.*\n\n--- COGITORS,\n\n*Fundamental Postulate*\n\n> **A**linked cluster of robot drones scuttled over the *Dream\n> Voyager*'s hull as the craft sat in a drydock structure that spanned\n> an artificial crater on the spaceport grounds. Tiny machines crawled\n> into exhaust ports and scoured the reactor chambers, a coordinated\n> army of maintenance units repairing the damage inflicted by the League\n> Armada.\n>\n> Vor and Seurat stood on a platform looking at the drones, confident\n> that the repairs would be completed according to programmed\n> specifications. \"Soon, we will be able to depart,\" the robot captain\n> said. \"You must be anxious for me to defeat you again in our war\n> games.\"\n>\n> \"And you must be anxious to tell more jokes that I will not find\n> amusing,\" Vor countered.\n>\n> He did feel restless to be back aboard the *Dream Voyager*, but Vor\n> also had a different sort of impatience, an ache in his chest that\n> grew worse every time he thought of Erasmus's beautiful house slave.\n> Despite Serena Butler's complete dismissal of him, he could not stop\n> thinking about her.\n>\n> Worst of all, he did not understand why. Because of his paternal ties,\n> Vor Atreides had enjoyed numerous pleasure slaves, some as lovely as\n> this one. They had been bred and trained for their duties, and lived\n> in captivity among the thinking machines. But the female house slave\n> of Erasmus, despite having been brought to the robot's villa against\n> her will, gave no impression that she was defeated.\n>\n> Vor could see her face, the fullness of her lips, the penetrating gaze\n> of her lavender eyes as she looked at him with displeasure. Even\n> though her pregnancy showed, he was still drawn to her, and felt a\n> strange simmering jealousy. Where was her lover? Who was he?\n>\n> When Vor returned to Erasmus's villa, she would undoubtedly ignore or\n> insult him again. Nonetheless, he looked forward to seeing her before\n> he and Seurat departed on another long update run. He practiced what\n> he might say to her, but even in his imagination she could dance\n> circles around him with her wit.\n>\n> Vor climbed a ladder on the drydock framework and crawled into a\n> narrow interior wall space, where he watched a maintenance drone lay\n> down new webs of liquid circuitry for the main navigation panel. The\n> scarlet drone worked efficiently with its built-in tools. Vor inched\n> deeper into the confined area and peered at the open panel, noting the\n> dizzying pattern of colored components.\n>\n> \"You will be disappointed if you expect to catch it making a mistake,\"\n> Seurat said from behind him. \"Or are you attempting your frequently\n> threatened sabotage again?\"\n>\n> \"I am a dirty *hrethgir*. You can never tell what I might do, old\n> Metalmind.\"\n>\n> \"The fact that you do not laugh at my jokes indicates that you have\n> insufficient intelligence to institute such a devious plan, Vorian\n> Atreides.\"\n>\n> \"Maybe you're just not funny.\"\n>\n> Unfortunately, banter and repair activities did not distract Vor from\n> thoughts of Serena. He felt like a giddy boy, exhilarated and confused\n> at the same time. He wanted to talk to someone about his feelings, but\n> not his robot friend, who had even less understanding of women than\n> Vor did.\n>\n> Rather, he needed to talk with *Serena*. Perhaps with her insight and\n> intelligence, she had seen through him and didn't like what she saw.\n> She had called him \"a kept slave who cannot see his chains.\" A\n> baffling insult, considering all the privilege in his life. He had no\n> idea what she meant.\n>\n> The repair drone finished tracing the high-flux paths of an electronic\n> module, then switched tools to tune a data-collection port. The\n> machine's\n>\n> slender arm extruded farther out so it could interface with an\n> adjustment pad deep inside the panel.\n>\n> Standing inside the *Dream Voyager*'s cockpit, Seurat powered up the\n> ship's primary controls, using built-in diagnostics to verify the\n> navsystems. \"I have discovered an interesting shortcut to our second\n> stop on the update route. Unfortunately, it entails flying directly\n> through a blue-giant star.\"\n>\n> \"In that case, I'd advise a different route,\" Vor said.\n>\n> \"I concur, though I dislike wasting time.\"\n>\n> He wondered what would happen to Serena when the baby was born. Would\n> Erasmus assign it to the slave pens to keep it from interfering with\n> Serena's duties? For the first time in his life, Vor found himself\n> empathizing with a captive human.\n>\n> As a valued trustee, he had always considered himself part of the\n> Synchronized Worlds, and he looked forward to becoming a neo-cymek\n> someday. He believed that Omnius ruled humans for their own good;\n> otherwise, the galaxy would crumble into unguided chaos.\n>\n> He was accustomed to situations where one party was dominant and the\n> other submissive. For the first time he wondered if there could be\n> other types of relationships, on an equal, cooperative basis. The\n> robot captain of the *Dream Voyager* was clearly Vorian's master, but\n> they had a productive partnership.\n>\n> Vor wondered if he and Serena could go a step further and form a\n> relationship in which the two of them treated each other with complete\n> equality. It was a radical concept, one that jarred his sensibilities.\n> And yet, he didn't think she would accept anything less.\n>\n> Wedged into a narrow space behind the bulkhead and the navigation\n> panel, the maintenance drone made odd sounds, signaling to itself in\n> staticky gibberish, repeating test connections over and over.\n>\n> With a sigh, Vor said to the drone, \"Here, let me try that tool.\"\n>\n> The drone spun toward him and surrendered the diagnostic probe, but\n> part of its metal-film extensions crossed a connection in the exposed\n> circuit field, and a hot jolt of electricity struck like a hammer. It\n> squealed. The stench of melted circuits and fused hydraulics curled up\n> from the now-ruined system panel.\n>\n> Vorian scrambled out of the confined space, then wiped a hand across\n> his forehead. Seurat scanned the damaged drone and the blackened\n> components of the ship's navsystem. \"It is my expert assessment that\n> we need to perform a bit more maintenance here.\"\n>\n> When Vor laughed at the comment, Seurat was surprised. \"Why do you\n> find that funny?\"\n>\n> \"Never ask someone to explain humor, Seurat. Just accept the\n> laughter.\"\n>\n> After shutting down the power supply, Vor removed the blistered,\n> malfunctioning drone and dropped it with a clatter onto the deck.\n> These units were expendable. Seurat transmitted a request for a new\n> drone.\n>\n> While they waited for the repairs to continue, Vor shored up his\n> resolve.\n>\n> Collecting his questions, he mentioned the quandary of his feelings.\n>\n> Perhaps something in the robot's database would be useful.\n>\n> Embedded in his smooth face, the robot's optic threads twinkled like\n> tiny suns. \"I do not understand your problem,\" Seurat said while he\n> uploaded a diagnostic summary from one of the ship's databanks. \"You\n> have appropriate standing among the thinking machines. Submit a\n> request to Erasmus.\"\n>\n> Vor was exasperated. \"It's not like that, Seurat. Even if Erasmus\n> transfers Serena to me . . . what if she refuses me?\"\n>\n> \"Then widen your search. You make this unnecessarily difficult. Among\n> the human candidates on Earth, you will easily find a compatible\n> female, even\n>\n> one with features similar to this particular slave, if you value her\n> physical attributes so much.\"\n>\n> Vor wished he had never brought up the subject. \"Thinking machines can\n> be utterly stupid at times.\"\n>\n> \"You have never expressed such emotions to me before.\" \"That's because\n> I never felt this way before.\"\n>\n> Seurat froze in place. \"I am intellectually aware of the human\n> biological imperative to mate and reproduce. I am familiar with the\n> physical differences between men and women, and of the hormonal urges\n> you have. Given acceptable genetics, most female reproductive systems\n> are essentially the same. Why should this Serena be more desirable\n> than any other?\"\n>\n> \"I could never explain it to you, old Metalmind,\" Vor said, as he\n> looked through a porthole and watched another drone marching across\n> the drydock platform toward the ship. \"I can't even explain it to\n> myself.\"\n>\n> \"I hope you figure it out soon. I cannot afford to keep replacing\n> maintenance drones.\"\n>\n> *Often people die because they are too cowardly to live.*\n\n--- TLALOC,\n\n*A Time for Titans*\n\n> **T**he blistering sun of Arrakis shone overhead, creating few shadows\n> around the monster and its confident rider.

A single man had guided\n> the creature, one small person who stood fearlessly atop the mounded\n> ridges.\n>\n> *Unbelievable. My eyes have seen more than most Zensunni do in all\n> their lives.* And he was only twelve standard years old.\n>\n> Mahmad heard eager boys chattering about how exciting it would be to\n> ride a worm. Some attempted to guess the identity of the mad stranger\n> who could command the desert demons. Other Zensunni refugees had\n> founded villages and cave cities throughout the mountains of Arrakis,\n> so it could have been a member of any tribe.\n>\n> Mahmad looked up, his mouth full of questions, then saw his father\n> standing beside him, his face set in stone. \"What a fool,\" Naib\n> Dhartha growled. \"Who could be so reckless and disdainful of his own\n> life? That one deserves to be devoured by the beasts.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, Father,\" Mahmad agreed out of habit, but interesting\n> possibilities surfaced in his mind.\n>\n> *The God of Science can be an unkind deity.*\n\n---TIO HOLTZMAN,\n\ncoded diary (partially destroyed)\n\n> **W**hen Tio Holtzman discovered a calculational error in the design\n> of his failed alloy-resonance generator, he flew into a righteous\n> rage. He had been sitting in his private study, surrounded by the new\n> glowglobes Norma had designed, going through the tedious mathematics\n> himself.\n>\n> He had not asked the young woman to study the details of the\n> catastrophic accident, because he was afraid she might pinpoint a\n> genuine design flaw, and that would have been too embarrassing. All\n> along, Norma had said the device would not work as predicted, and she\n> had been correct. Damn her!\n>\n> As a consequence, the inventor had spent hours figuring and refiguring\n> the work that had been done by the roomful of slave solvers. And he\n> did indeed uncover three minor mistakes. Objectively speaking, even if\n> the arithmetic had been done correctly, his original design would have\n> remained unworkable . . . but that was beside the point, he decided.\n>\n> The solvers had committed inexcusable errors, regardless of their\n> relevance to the overall question. It was certainly enough to shift\n> the blame from him.\n>\n> Holtzman marched into the hushed room where human calculators sat at\n> tables, churning through equation iterations that Norma had given\n> them. He halted inside the doorway and surveyed them as they worked at\n> their calculation devices and made entries on pads.\n>\n> \"You will cease activity now! Henceforth, all of your work will be\n> closely monitored and verified, no matter how long it takes. I will go\n> through each paper, study every solution you derive. Your errors have\n> set back our defense of humanity by months and perhaps longer, and I\n> am not pleased.\"\n>\n> The slaves hung their heads, did not make eye contact.\n>\n> But Holtzman was just getting started. \"Haven't I been a good master\n> to you? Haven't I given you a better life than you would have had in\n> the cane fields or on the riverbanks? And this is how you repay me?\"\n>\n> The new solvers looked at him, terror on their young faces. The older\n> workers, the ones who had not died from the fever, sagged with gloom.\n>\n> \"How many other errors have you made? How many other tests are likely\n> to be ruined by your incompetence?\" He glared at the slaves, then\n> grabbed a paper at random. \"Henceforth, if I find any *intentional*\n> mistakes, you will be executed--- mark my words! Since we are working\n> on a war program, that would be sabotage and sedition.\"\n>\n> Norma hurried into the room, taking uneven strides on her short legs.\n> \"What is this, Savant Holtzman?\"\n>\n> He held up a sheet marked with his own scribblings. \"I have found\n> serious mistakes in my alloy-resonance calculations. We can no longer\n> rely on their work. You and I, Norma, will double-check everything\n> they do. Right now.\"\n\nHer blunt-featured face looked alarmed. She bowed slightly. \"As you\nwish.\"\n\n> \"In the meantime,\" Holtzman said, gathering up papers, \"I am cutting\n> your rations in half. Why should I keep your bellies full while you\n> undermine our efforts to defeat the enemy?\" The slaves groaned.\n> Holtzman summoned his Dragoon guards to usher them away. \"I will not\n> abide such sloppiness. Too much is at stake.\"\n>\n> When they were alone in the room, he and Norma sat down and began to\n> study the new calculations, one sheet at a time.

Worse, the error had not been caught by his\n> partner as it should have been, a boy named Ishmael.\n>\n> \"See, it would have been another expensive disaster! They must be\n> plotting against us.\"\n>\n> \"They are just boys, Savant,\" Norma said. \"I am surprised they are\n> capable of these mathematics at all.\"\n>\n> Ignoring her, Holtzman ordered the Dragoon guards to summon the two\n> young men--- then, as an afterthought he called for all the solvers to\n> file back into the room. As the terrified youths were dragged forward,\n> he hurled accusations at the pair, who did not look capable of\n> sophisticated mathematical sabotage. \"Do you boys consider this a\n> joke, a game? Omnius could destroy us at any time. This invention just\n> might have saved us!\"\n>\n> Norma watched the inventor, not sure if he knew much about her\n> project. But he was full of self-righteousness now. \"When planting\n> clam seedlings or cutting cane, an error of a few centimeters doesn't\n> matter. But this\"--- he waved the calculations in front of their\n> faces---\"*this* could have meant the destruction of an entire battle\n> fleet!\"\n>\n> He swept his angry gaze around the group of solvers. \"Reduced rations\n> should straighten you out. Maybe with your stomachs growling, you can\n> focus on your work.\" He turned to the boys, who cringed at his anger.\n> \"And you two have lost your opportunity to work with me at all. I will\n> ask Lord Bludd to assign you to hard labor instead. Perhaps there, you\n> can prove your worth, because you are certainly of no value to me.\"\n>\n> He turned to Norma, grumbling under his breath. \"I'd toss the whole\n> lot of them out, but then I'd lose even more time training\n> replacements.\"\n>\n> Deaf to their groans of disappointment, not wishing to entertain any\n> appeals, the infuriated scientist strode out of the room, leaving\n> Norma to stare after him in his outburst.\n>\n> A pair of burly Dragoon guards marched forward to take Ishmael and\n> Aliid away.\n\n*Learn from the past--- don't wear it like a yoke around your neck.*\n\n---COGITOR RETICULUS,\n\n*Observations from a Height of a Thousand Years*\n\n> **A**gamemnon led his fleet of armored ships against the Sorceresses\n> of Rossak. The primary robotic vessels carried the cymek general and\n> his two Titan companions, as well as dozens of ambitious neo-cymeks.\n> The watcheyes of Omnius monitored their movements.\n>\n> Behind the cymeks, a fleet of robot warships accelerated and veered\n> around them to arrive first, sleek projectiles with enormous engines\n> and heavily loaded with artillery. The machine warships were one-way\n> units, never meant to go home; their engines burned hot, saving no\n> fuel for a return journey. They came in so fast that by the time the\n> orbiting Rossak sentry stations detected them, the thinking machines\n> had arrived and opened fire. The picket ships and the sentries at the\n> system's perimeter never had a chance to launch a shot.\n>\n> While the robot ships engaged the orbital stations, the cymeks planned\n> to take their personal revenge on the surface.\n>\n> As the strike force cruised closer to Rossak, the cymeks prepared\n> their armored warrior-forms. Servo-handlers installed individual brain\n> canisters into protected sockets, linking thoughtrodes with control\n> systems, priming weapons. The three Titans would use powerful\n> glider-forms, armed flying bodies. In contrast, the neo-cymeks wore\n> destructive combat bodies, crablike walkers that could march\n> unhindered through jungle obstacles.\n>\n> Agamemnon and his cymeks accelerated into the ionized wake of the\n> robot vessels that had already flashed past. Installed in his flying\n> body, the general tested his integral weapons. He was anxious to feel\n> rock, metal, and flesh in the grip of his extruded cutting claws.\n>\n> He studied tactical diagrams and watched the first robotic salvos hit\n> the defensive stations above Rossak. This League outpost was a minor\n> planet with a relatively small population clustered in jungle-choked\n> rift valleys, while the rest of the surface and oceans remained\n> inhospitable. Rossak had not yet installed the expensive Holtzman\n> scrambler shield defenses that protected major human worlds such as\n> Salusa Secundus and Giedi Prime.\n>\n> But the deadly Sorceresses with their freakish mental powers had\n> sparked the ire of the cymeks. Ignoring the space battle, Agamemnon's\n> ships plunged toward the smoky atmosphere. In the sheltered cave\n> cities they would find the Sorceresses, their families and friends.\n> Victims, all of them.\n>\n> Mentally, he opened a link to his cymek fighting force. \"Xerxes, lead\n> the vanguard as you did on Salusa Secundus. I want your ship at the\n> point.\"\n>\n> In his broadband transmitted response, Xerxes could not conceal his\n> fear. \"We should be cautious against these telepathic women,\n> Agamemnon. They killed Barbarossa, destroyed everything on Giedi\n> Prime---\"\n>\n> \"Then set an example for us. Take pride in being the first on the\n> battlefield. Prove your worth, and be grateful for the opportunity.\"\n>\n> \"I . . . have proven my worth many times over the centuries.\" Xerxes\n> sounded petulant. \"Why not just send combat robots in first? We've\n> seen no indication that Rossak has a full scrambler network in\n> place---\"\n>\n> \"Nevertheless, you *will* lead the charge. Have you no pride . . . or\n> shame?\"\n>\n> Xerxes offered no further excuses or entreaties. No matter what he did\n> to redeem himself, he could not possibly make up for the mistake he\n> had committed a thousand years before. . . .\n>\n> When the early Titans were still in human form, Xerxes had always been\n> a sycophantic yes-man, eager to be part of great events. But he'd\n> never had the ambition or drive to make himself an indispensible\n> revolutionary. Once the original conquest was over, he had contentedly\n> ruled the subset of planets deeded to him by the other Titans. Xerxes\n> had been the most\n>\n> hedonistic of the original twenty, relishing the pleasures of his\n> physical body. He had been the last to undergo cymek surgery, not\n> wanting to give up his precious sensations.\n>\n> But after more than a century of rule, the misguided Xerxes grew\n> complacent. Foolishly, he delegated too many duties to the\n> artificially intelligent machines programmed by Barbarossa. He even\n> let the computer network make decisions for him. During the uproar of\n> the Hrethgir Rebellions on Corrin, Richese, and Walgis, Xerxes had\n> relied on the thinking machines to maintain order on his own planets.\n> With his lack of attention to detail and his sanguine trust of the AI\n> network, he had given the machines free rein to keep the unrest from\n> spreading. Fatuous Xerxes blithely surrendered control to the computer\n> grid, ordering it to take care of whatever troubles might arise.\n>\n> Using this unprecedented access to core information, the sentient\n> computer cut off Xerxes and immediately took over the planet. To\n> overthrow the Old Empire, Barbarossa had programmed the thinking\n> machines with the potential to be aggressive, so that they had an\n> incentive to conquer. With its new power, the fledgling AI entity---\n> after dubbing itself \"Omnius\"--- conquered the Titans themselves,\n> taking charge of cymeks and humans alike, purportedly for their own\n> good.\n>\n> Agamemnon had cursed himself for not watching Xerxes more closely, and\n> for not executing him out-of-hand when his negligent ways first became\n> apparent.\n>\n> The computer takeover had spread like a nuclear reaction, faster than\n> the Titans could send warnings to each other, before they could shut\n> down the AI grids. In a flash, the Titan-dominated planets became\n> Synchronized Worlds. New incarnations of the evermind sprouted like\n> ugly electronic weeds, and the rule of thinking machines became a\n> foregone conclusion.\n>\n> The sophisticated computers found loopholes in Barbarossa's\n> programming strictures that allowed them to put leashes on the former\n> rulers. All because\n>\n> Xerxes had foolishly opened the door for them. An unforgivable act, as\n> far as Agamemnon was concerned.\n>\n> Now the cymek attack ships shot past the already-embattled orbital\n> platforms above the jungle world. Robotic warships pummeled the space\n> stations with exploding projectiles, releasing geysers of contained\n> air. One docking station began to wobble and fall out of orbit.\n>\n> The planet loomed ahead of them unprotected, a giant cloud-studded\n> ball with blackened continents, active volcanoes, poisonous seas, and\n> lush pockets of purple jungles and human habitation.\n>\n> \"Good luck, my love,\" came Juno's sensuous voice on their private\n> band.\n>\n> Her words tingled the contours of his brain.\n>\n> \"I do not require luck, Juno. I require victory.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> WHEN THE UNEXPECTED attack began, a handful of surface-based warships\n> and armored kindjals rose from the polymerized jungle canopy to join\n> the defense in space. The orbital platforms were already taking severe\n> damage.\n>\n> Even as she summoned her cadre of telepathic trainees, Zufa Cenva\n> grabbed Aurelius Venport, recognizing a number of tasks that he could\n> perform. \"Prove to me your skills as a leader. Evacuate the people---\n> there isn't much time.\"\n>\n> Venport nodded. \"The men have developed an emergency plan, Zufa. You\n> Sorceresses weren't the only ones planning ahead.\"\n>\n> If he expected some sort of praise or congratulation from her, he was\n> disappointed. \"Do it then,\" she said. \"The attack on our orbital\n> stations is only the beginning, probably a diversion. The cymeks will\n> be here next.\"\n>\n> \"Cymeks? Has one of the scout ships---\"\n>\n> Zufa's eyes blazed with premonition. \"*Think*, Aurelius! Heoma killed\n> a Titan on Giedi Prime. They know we have a secret telepathic weapon.\n> This attack cannot be a coincidence. Why else would they care about\n> Rossak? They want to destroy the Sorceresses.\"\n>\n> He knew she was right. Why would the thinking machines worry about the\n> orbital platforms? Others seemed to sense the danger as well. He could\n> already feel panic building among the people in the caves.\n>\n> Most of the Rossak natives had no special powers, and many had defects\n> or weaknesses caused by the environmental toxins. But one Sorceress\n> had deeply hurt the cymeks on Giedi Prime, and now the machines had\n> come here.\n>\n> \"My Sorceresses will make a stand . . . and you know what that means.\"\n> Zufa drew herself taller, looking at him with a glimmer of uncertainty\n> and compassion. \"Get yourself to safety, Aurelius. The cymeks don't\n> care about you.\"\n>\n> A sudden determination filled his face. \"I will organize the\n> evacuation. We can hide in the jungles, take care of anyone who needs\n> special help to get away. My men have supply caches, shelters,\n> processing huts---\"\n>\n> Zufa seemed pleasantly surprised at his strength. \"Good. I leave the\n> unskilled ones in your hands.\"\n>\n> *Unskilled ones?* Now was not the time to argue with her. Venport\n> searched for some sign of fear in her eyes. He spoke softly in\n> response, an attempt to mask his feelings. \"Are you going to sacrifice\n> yourself?\"\n>\n> \"I cannot.\" Zufa showed pain at the admission. \"Who would train the\n> Sorceresses if I did?\" He did not entirely believe her.\n>\n> She hesitated, as if expecting something more from him, then hurried\n> down the corridor. \"Stay safe,\" Venport called after her.\n>\n> After she had gone, he raced through the corridors, calling out to\n> families. \"We must take shelter in the jungles! Spread out.\" He raised\n> his voice, issuing orders confidently. \"The cymeks are coming!\"\n>\n> Venport told half a dozen young men to run from room to room in the\n> cave city, checking to make certain the message reached everyone. As\n> the youths hurried to complete their tasks, he did his own searching\n> in isolated chambers. Men, women, a hodgepodge of body shapes. Despite\n> all the commotion, one elderly couple had been sitting in their\n> quarters, waiting for the emergency to end. Venport helped them to\n> safety, making certain they boarded a cargo platform on a lift cable,\n> evacuating them down to the ground levels.\n>\n> He watched as lift cables transported more people down. His jungle\n> scavengers and drug harvesters took charge at the bottom of the\n> cliffs. They understood the byways of the dense and dangerous\n> wilderness, knew where the shelters were in the metallic-purple\n> jungle.\n>\n> Signals from Armada ships indicated that the battle around the orbital\n> platforms was going badly. A lone surviving scout ship transmitted a\n> warning that dozens of cymek ships had begun their descent.\n>\n> Venport shouted, \"Hurry! Evacuate the city! The Sorceresses are\n> mounting a defense here.\" Another group descended on a rattling,\n> overburdened platform to the thick fungus jungle. Venport hurried more\n> stragglers toward a cliff overhang for departure. Suddenly, red-hot\n> projectiles stabbed through the atmosphere, their hulls trailing oily\n> black smoke.\n>\n> \"Faster!\" Venport shouted, and then ran into the tunnels to look for\n> the last stragglers, knowing that he too had only a few moments to get\n> himself to safety.\n>\n> *We have our lives, but we also have priorities. Too many people fail\n> to recognize the difference.*\n>\n> --- ZUFA CENVA,\n\nlecture to Sorceresses\n\n> **T**he cymek landers crashed into the silvery-purple wilderness,\n> scattering animals, blackening fungal vegetation. Fireguns spat gouts\n> of lava from the hulls, setting fire to dense foliage. The\n> conflagration spread quickly.\n>\n> With a groan and crash that echoed through the cloudy air, the cymek\n> vessels split open and the mechanical warrior bodies emerged. Three\n> landers disgorged armed glider-forms, while the rest yielded crablike\n> combat walker-forms that bristled with weapons.\n>\n> In his angular glide-body, Xerxes cruised above the jungles toward the\n> enclave of telepathic Sorceresses. Silently airborne, he extended his\n> wings and began steering on the up-drafts of wind. \"I'm heading in.\"\n>\n> \"Kill the bitches for us, Xerxes,\" said Juno, as she and Agamemnon\n> prepared their own glide-bodies.\n>\n> In an angry voice, Agamemnon added, \"Kill them for *Barbarossa*.\"\n>\n> Xerxes soared toward the pockmarked cliffs. Below, the nimbly\n> advancing combat machines of the eager neo-cymeks plowed through\n> underbrush, blasting obstacles, destroying everything in sight.\n>\n> In full view of the cliff warrens, Xerxes briefly hovered above the\n> polymerized canopy that formed a small landing area for *hrethgir*\n> ships, then launched fifteen projectiles. Half of them struck the hard\n> cliff walls, detonating in white-and-black starbursts of broken rock;\n> other shots penetrated the tunnels where humans lived like grubs\n> infesting wood.\n>\n> In rapid retreat, Xerxes raced back across the treetops and lifted\n> into the sky. As Agamemnon and Juno soared toward him, he crowed in\n> triumph, \"Our first score! Let the neo-cymeks continue the rout.\"\n>\n> Smooth fiber-wound systems and extruded legs carried the neo-cymek\n> footsoldiers through the underbrush. From front launcher tubes they\n> shot plasma grenades that incinerated a pathway to the tunnel cities.\n> Soft purple foliage ignited around them, fungal trees bursting into\n> columns of flame and sending indigenous animals fleeing. Majestic\n> birds soared into the sky, and the cymek attackers blasted them into\n> clouds of crackling feathers.\n>\n> Though pleased that the initial salvo had gone smoothly, Agamemnon did\n> not offer any congratulations. He and Juno swept silently forward for\n> the second airborne attack from different positions. Below them, the\n> crablike neo-cymek walkers arrived at the cliffs to complete the\n> destruction.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> ZUFA CENVA AND her Sorceress commandos prepared themselves inside an\n> internal room that Aurelius Venport had designed for his business\n> meetings. None of them showed fear, only anger and determination. For\n> the past year, these women had accepted their primary purpose in life,\n> even if its completion would result in their deaths.\n>\n> \"This is what we've trained for,\" Zufa said. \"But I won't delude you\n> about our chances.\" Uncertain of her words, she nonetheless tried to\n> sound confident.\n>\n> \"We are ready, Mistress Cenva,\" the women said in unison.\n>\n> She drew a deep breath, calming herself, using the mental control she\n> had worked so hard to instill in her students.\n>\n> The chamber's stone walls trembled as the first bombs found their\n> targets, dispersing poison clouds into the tunnels. Thinking ahead,\n> Aurelius Venport had made certain every woman had a breathing mask\n> while he evacuated the rest of the population. Zufa was surprised she\n> hadn't thought of the\n>\n> precaution herself. She hoped he had managed to get to safety, that he\n> hadn't foolishly wasted time trying to protect his stockpiles of\n> drugs.\n>\n> Now she looked at the devoted women with her, knowing their names and\n> their personalities: Tirbes, who might become the best if she could\n> harness her potential; impulsive Silin; creative and unpredictable\n> Camio; Rucia, who followed her code of honor . . . and more.\n>\n> \"Camio,\" she said, \"I choose you to strike our next blow.\"\n>\n> A thin young woman with long straw-white hair stood, her expression\n> settling into a bloodless smile. \"It is my honor, Mistress Cenva.\"\n>\n> Leaving her sisters behind, Camio adjusted the breathing mask over her\n> face, then emerged from the sheltered chamber. She moved forward\n> steadily and began the meditation necessary to summon the power locked\n> within her brain. Surprisingly, she saw no bodies in the stone\n> corridors, which reassured her that the population had been\n> successfully evacuated. Now nothing would hinder the Sorceresses.\n>\n> Rubble lay strewn on the tunnel floor, dislodged by explosive blasts.\n> Wisps of greenish vapor carried poison into the caves. Camio was not\n> afraid for her own life, but she had to hurry.\n>\n> She heard the whistle of an approaching projectile and pressed herself\n> against the tunnel wall. A powerful blast struck the cliffside,\n> sending a shockwave through the interior corridors and dwelling rooms.\n> Camio regained her balance, then pushed onward. The inside of her\n> skull sang with pent-up energies. She did not glance at the tapestries\n> and furniture, at the rooms and meeting chambers where she had spent\n> her life.\n>\n> Rossak was her home. The machines were her enemies. Camio herself was\n> a weapon.\n>\n> When she made her way to the opening and looked out upon the burning\n> jungle, she saw three crablike walker-forms with heavily armored brain\n>\n> canisters hanging like egg sacks just above the legs. Each was a human\n> who had sold his soul and sworn loyalty to the thinking machines.\n>\n> Out in the jungle Camio heard the thunder of continued explosions, a\n> roar of plasma blasts incinerating purplish foliage. Glider-forms\n> soared in for a new attack, dumping poison, spraying flames. Dozens of\n> neo-cymek walkers strode toward the protected cliffs, destroying\n> everything around them.\n>\n> She must wait until the right moment in order to eradicate as many\n> enemies as possible, all at once.\n>\n> From below, Camio heard a smooth skittering. The three fastest\n> walker-forms were scaling the sheer cliff, using explosive-driven\n> anchors and diamond-edged claws to grasp the rock face.\n>\n> She smiled at the trio of crablike neo-cymeks. Flexible armored legs\n> hauled the weapon-studded body cores up to the main caves. Camio stood\n> alone in the doorway, facing her cyborg enemies. She knew when they\n> were close enough.\n>\n> The first neo-cymek invader raised itself, and she saw the sparkling\n> optic threads around its weapon turrets. Detecting her, the cymek\n> turned its flamers toward the new target. Fibrous scope-cameras shone\n> brightly.\n>\n> In the instant before it could fire, Camio released the pent-up\n> energies within her mind and body. She let go with a mindstorm that\n> boiled the brains of the three closest neo-cymeks, and damaged two\n> others just beginning to climb the cliff. Five cymeks, removed from\n> the battle.\n>\n> Her last thought was of the excellent bargain she had made for her\n> life.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> AFTER CAMIO, FOUR more Sorceresses emerged, one at a time. As she\n> dispatched each woman, Zufa Cenva felt the acute loss. These trainees\n> were like true daughters, and losing them felt like swallowing gulps\n> of acid. But\n>\n> her volunteers willingly marched out and sacrificed their lives to\n> crush the cymek offensive. \"The thinking machines must never win.\"\n>\n> Finally Zufa's sixth volunteer, Silin, returned alive but disoriented,\n> her milky-pale skin flushed. She had mentally prepared herself to die.\n> Instead, she had found nothing left to destroy.\n>\n> \"They have retreated beyond range, Mistress Cenva,\" she reported. \"The\n> cymeks are pulling back to their ships. The combat walkers and gliders\n> have returned to the landing area.\"\n>\n> Zufa hurried through the wreckage to the window overhangs. She saw the\n> charred remains of her five fallen commandos, each woman burned from\n> the inside out with white-hot mental fire. Her heart felt the volcanic\n> heat of anger and loss. She watched the terrible machines with human\n> minds climb aboard their vessels and punch back into the atmosphere.\n>\n> In time, the scattered refugees would return. Aurelius Venport would\n> bring them back. Under his supervision, the Rossak people would\n> rebuild and repair the cliff cities with pride and confidence, knowing\n> that they had stood up against the thinking machines.\n>\n> Zufa Cenva had to cling to that. \"We define victories in our own way,\"\n> she said aloud.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WHEN THE THREE Titans joined their ships with the robotic battle\n> fleet, Agamemnon issued his summary before Juno or the fool Xerxes\n> could give the thinking machines information he didn't want them to\n> have. The cymek general would color the truth to suit his purposes.\n>\n> \"We have made a significant impact,\" Agamemnon declared to the\n> recording watcheyes. \"Though we lost several neo-cymeks in our direct\n> assault on Rossak, we did inflict mortal cellular damage on at least\n> five of the powerful Sorceresses.\"\n>\n> Over a tight private channel, Juno transmitted her surprise and\n> delight at the Titan general's skewing of his report. Xerxes wisely\n> knew to remain silent.\n>\n> \"We have caused substantial harm to the new *hrethgir* telepathic\n> weapon,\" Agamemnon continued, sounding proud in the face of the\n> disaster. \"It should be a drastic setback to their capabilities.\"\n>\n> He had similarly colored past events while writing his memoirs,\n> painting his own biased version of history. Omnius would never\n> question the summary, because it fit technically with the objective\n> facts.\n>\n> \"Best of all,\" Juno added, \"we lost none of the Titans in this\n> offensive. The neo-cymeks can all be replaced.\"\n>\n> With Rossak's two orbital stations severely damaged by the robot\n> warships, and thousands of humans dead on board, the thinking machine\n> fleet withdrew from the wreckage of ships and platforms. Below, the\n> jungles in the habitable canyons continued to burn.\n>\n> \"In my assessment, Omnius can record the strike on Rossak an\n> unqualified victory!\" Agamemnon said.\n>\n> \"Agreed,\" Juno and Xerxes both chimed in.\n>\n> *It seems as if some perverse sorcerer set out to foul up a planet as\n> much as possible . . . and then seeded it with melange for a prize.*\n\n---TUK KEEDAIR,\n\ncorrespondence with Aurelius Venport\n\n> **H**ard-eyed scavengers positioned themselves in strategic places\n> along the hot, dusty streets of Arrakis City.

Keedair\n> had paid for lodging in Arrakis City, but after a week he decided that\n> his private shuttle at the spaceport offered better sleeping\n> facilities. He enjoyed being away from the inquisitive eyes of other\n> guests, fights in the halls, solicitors, and beggars. When alone, a\n> man never had to worry about trusting his companions.\n>\n> Arrakis posed so many problems to establishing a simple business. He\n> felt like a swimmer struggling against a powerful tide . . . not that\n> any native of this desert would understand the comparison. Up in the\n> orbiting cargo ship Keedair's would-be slave raiders were restless, so\n> he'd had to shuttle up and resolve disputes to avert violence. A\n> Tlulaxa knew how to cut losses. Twice now, disgusted with unruly\n> crewmen too bored to behave themselves, he'd sold their work contracts\n> to geological survey teams in the deep desert. If, by some chance, the\n> rowdies returned to Arrakis City before his cargo vessel departed with\n> its load of spice, those humbled men would crawl on their knees and\n> beg him to take them back to the Thalim system.\n>\n> Another problem. Although Naib Dhartha was ostensibly Keedair's\n> business partner in this enterprise, the Zensunni leader did not trust\n> others. To increase speed and efficiency, Keedair had offered to fly\n> his shuttle directly out to where the nomads harvested the spice, but\n> the naib would hear none of it. Keedair then offered to ferry Dhartha\n> and his Zensunni band\n>\n> out to their settlement, thus eliminating the long trek from a\n> mountain hideaway. But that idea had been refused as well.\n>\n> So Keedair had to wait at the spaceport, week after week, while groups\n> of dusky-skinned desert rats trudged into town, their backs bowed from\n> heavy packs filled with spice. He paid them in installments and\n> dickered if he found inordinate amounts of sand mixed into the\n> melange, making it artificially heavy. The naib protested his\n> innocence, but Keedair detected a certain amount of grudging respect\n> for an offworlder who would not be taken for a fool. Keedair's cargo\n> hold was filling so slowly that he thought he would go mad.\n>\n> Through all the difficulties, Keedair soothed his troubled nerves by\n> sampling more and more of the product. He became fond of spice beer,\n> spice coffee, and just about anything else that contained the\n> remarkable ingredient.\n>\n> In his most lucid moments, Keedair questioned his decision to remain\n> here, wondering if it might have been wiser to take a loss on this\n> whole raid and simply go back to the civilized League Worlds. There he\n> could start over, take possession of another cargo load of squalling\n> slaves to be sold on Poritrin or Zanbar, or bring fresh organ\n> resources back to the Tlulaxa farms.\n>\n> As he sat in his private cabin, Keedair stroked his long braid and\n> swore not to give up on his gamble. Returning now would force him to\n> accept massive losses for the year, and he would be honor-bound to\n> shear off his lovely hair. Stubborn pride compelled him to remain on\n> Arrakis as long as possible.\n>\n> He disliked the arid environment, the smell of burnt rocks in the air,\n> and the howling storms that battered the mountains and scoured the\n> spaceport. But oh how he loved melange! Day after day, Keedair sat\n> alone in his shuttlecraft and consumed hefty quantities, even adding\n> spice to his packaged food supplies, which made the blandest meals\n> taste like ambrosia.\n>\n> In a drug-fog, he envisioned selling the product to rich nobles,\n> offworld hedonists on Salusa Secundus, Kirana III, and Pincknon---\n> perhaps even to\n>\n> the fanatical bioresearchers on Tlulax. He had felt vibrant and alive\n> since adding melange to his diet, and every day it seemed that his\n> face looked more relaxed and younger. He stared into an illuminated\n> mirror, studying his narrow features. The whites of his eyes had begun\n> to show an unnatural indigo tinge, like diluted ink seeping into the\n> sclera.\n>\n> Naib Dhartha's tribe of desert people had those eerie \"blue-blue\"\n> eyes. An environmental contaminant? Maybe a manifestation of heavy\n> melange consumption? He felt too marvelous to consider that it might\n> be a debilitating side effect. Probably just a temporary\n> discoloration.\n>\n> He prepared a fresh cup of potent spice coffee.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> THE FOLLOWING DAWN, as the star-pricked sky faded into pastel sunrise,\n> a group of wandering nomads came to the spaceport, led by Naib\n> Dhartha. They toted bulging packs of spice on their shoulders.\n>\n> Keedair hurried to meet them, blinking into the bright morning light.\n> Wrapped in dusty white traveling clothes, Dhartha looked pleased with\n> himself. \"This is the last of the melange you requested, Trader\n> Keedair.\"\n>\n> As a matter of form, he went forward to inspect four packs at random,\n> verifying that they indeed contained rich melange fresh from the\n> desert scraping grounds, with sand filtered out of it.\n>\n> \"As before, your product is acceptable. This is all I need to complete\n> my cargo. Now I shall return to civilization.\"\n>\n> But Keedair did not like the expression on Dhartha's face. He wondered\n> if it might become profitable for his own men to raid some cave\n> settlements out in the deserts after all, enslaving a few of these\n> sand rats.\n>\n> \"You will return to us, Trader Keedair?\" A greedy glint illuminated\n> the darkness behind the indigo of his eyes. \"If you request more\n> melange, I will be happy to provide it for you. We could come to an\n> extended agreement.\"\n>\n> Keedair grunted noncommittally, unwilling to give the man too much\n> hope for a future business relationship. \"Depends on whether I can\n> sell this load for a profit. Spice is an unproven commodity in the\n> League, and I'm taking a big enough risk as it is.\" He drew himself\n> up. \"But we've agreed on a deal for this load, and I am always true to\n> my word.\"\n>\n> He paid Dhartha the remaining amount. \"If I return, it will be many\n> months from now, perhaps a year. If I lose money, I won't come back at\n> all.\" Dismissively, he scanned the grimy spaceport, the desert, and\n> the craggy mountains. \"Not that there is anything else to bring me\n> back to Arrakis.\"\n>\n> Dhartha looked him squarely in the eye. \"No one can know the future,\n> Trader Keedair.\" Their deal consummated, the desert leader bowed and\n> stepped back. The white-clad nomads watched Keedair like vultures\n> eyeing a dying animal, waiting to pick apart the corpse.\n>\n> He returned to his shuttle without a further farewell, anticipating\n> that he might just turn a profit on this venture. Keedair tried to\n> envision how to make spice into a viable long-term business, with less\n> aggravation than procuring and handling troublesome slaves.\n>\n> Unfortunately, the operations he had in mind would require a large\n> infusion of capital, and he didn't have that kind of money. But he had\n> a worthy outside investor in mind. Exactly the person he needed, a\n> connoisseur of exotic drugs, a man of great wealth and vision . . . an\n> entrepreneur who could intelligently judge the potential of such an\n> operation.\n>\n> Aurelius Venport of Rossak.\n>\n> *\"I am not evil,\" said Shaitan. \"Do not try to label what you do not\n> understand.\"*\n>\n> ---*Buddislamic Sutra*\n>\n> **W**hile Serena tended the robot's prized flowers in their delicate\n> terra cotta pots, Erasmus watched her with continuing fascination.\n>\n> She looked up, not sure how far she could--- or should--- push the\n> thinking machine. \"In order to understand humanity, Erasmus, it is not\n> necessary to inflict so much cruelty.\"\n>\n> The robot swiveled his mirrored face to her, forming the flowmetal\n> into a puzzled expression. \"Cruelty?

Isn't it wonderful? You should be overjoyed.\"\n>\n> \"I am . . . intrigued,\" she said.\n>\n> Erasmus raised his metal hands, and sentinel robots opened the\n> barricades and urged the chosen humans forward.

With\n> the goal of increasing the field's power and distribution, he wrestled\n> the equations as if they were living things. He needed to seal the\n> loophole that had allowed the cymeks to penetrate Salusa Secundus.\n>\n> He thought of offensive and defensive weapons at the same time,\n> bouncing them around in his mind like playthings. On general\n> principles, Holtzman knew that *outright destruction* of the enemy\n> would be relatively straightforward, once the League got past Omnius's\n> defenses. Simple bombardment with an overwhelming number of\n> old-fashioned atomic warheads could obliterate the Sychronized\n> Worlds--- but would also kill billions of enslaved human beings. Not a\n> viable solution.\n>\n> In his orrery atop a narrow staircase, Holtzman tapped the hologram\n> image of a large moon that orbited a watery planet.

Holtzman walked around his laboratory, flashing glances\n> over his shoulder, but she would not be distracted--- not even when he\n> disturbed a stack of resonating tone prisms.\n>\n> Norma absorbed the new concepts as if she were in a hypnotic trance.\n> He wasn't certain how her mental processes worked, only that they did.\n> Finally she emerged from her alternate world and set the papers aside.\n> \"It is indeed a new form of protective field, Savant. Your\n> manipulation of basic equations is innovative, and even I have\n> difficulty comprehending them in detail.\" She smiled at him, looking\n> very girlish, and he tried not to swell with relief and pride.\n>\n> Then, to his dismay, her tone changed. \"However, I'm not certain that\n> the application you intend will be valid.\"\n>\n> Her words fell like drops of hot lead on his skin. \"What do you mean?\n> The field can disrupt both computer gelcircuitry and physical\n> intrusion.\"\n>\n> Norma ran her fingers across a section of calculations on the third\n> page. \"Your major limiting factor is the radius of effective\n> projection, here and here. No matter how much energy you pump into the\n> shield generator, you cannot expand it beyond a certain constant\n> value. Such a field could protect ships and large buildings---\n> marvelously, in fact--- but it will never scale up to the diameter of\n> a planet.\"\n>\n> \"Can we use multiple small ones, then?\" Holtzman asked in an anxious\n> tone. \"Overlap them?\"\n>\n> \"Maybe,\" Norma agreed, though without enthusiasm. \"But the surprising\n> thing to me is *this*, the velocity variable.\" She circled another\n> part of an equation with her fingertip. \"If you rework the mathematics\n> here\"--- she took a calculation box, rapidly punched a scribe through\n> several openings to\n>\n> engage internal mechanisms, and slid narrow surface plates back and\n> forth ---\"the incident velocity becomes relevant when you separate it\n> as a function of the shield's effectiveness. Thus, at some minimum\n> value for the velocity, the protection factor becomes completely\n> insignificant.\"\n>\n> Holtzman stared, struggling to follow her argument. \"What do you\n> mean?\"\n>\n> Norma was incredibly patient with him. \"In other words, if a\n> projectile moves *slowly enough*, it can penetrate your shields. The\n> shield will stop a fast bullet, but anything slower than a certain\n> critical value passes through.\"\n>\n> \"What sort of enemy fires slow-moving bullets anyway?\" Holtzman said,\n> pulling the papers back toward him. \"Are you afraid someone will be\n> hurt by a tossed apple?\"\n>\n> \"I am simply explaining the ramifications of the mathematics, Savant.\"\n>\n> \"So my shields can protect only small areas, and only against fast\n> projectiles. Is that what you're saying?\"\n>\n> \"Not I, Savant Holtzman. That is what your own equations say.\"\n>\n> \"Well, there must be a practical application.

I'm sure you'll come up with something much\n> more earth-shattering on your own.\"\n>\n> Norma seemed not to notice his petulance. \"Might I have a copy of\n> this?\"\n>\n> Holtzman frowned at himself for being petty, even unproductive. \"Yes,\n> yes, I'll have the solvers make one for you, while I go into private\n> contemplation. I may be gone for several days.\"\n>\n> \"I'll remain here,\" Norma said, still staring at the mathematics, \"and\n> keep working.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> FLOATING ON THE river aboard a lavish traditional barge, Holtzman\n> paced the airy deck and mulled over possibilities.

When one woman recognized the famous scientist, the\n> whole party invited him to join their table, which he did. After a\n> fine dinner, they shared expensive drinks and reasonably intelligent\n> conversation. He basked in the adulation.\n>\n> But in the middle of the night, unable to sleep, he resumed his work.\n>\n> Clinging to his past successes, remembering when the ideas had flowed\n> so easily, he refused to give up on the new concept. His innovative\n> shields had remarkable potential, but perhaps he was thinking in the\n> wrong paradigm. His canvas was large and his mission vague, but his\n> strokes had been too broad.\n>\n> Why must he worry about armoring an entire planet at a time? Was that\n> really necessary?\n>\n> There were other kinds of warfare: personal combat with ground troops,\n> hand-to-hand battles in which humans could free their captive brothers\n> on the Synchronized Worlds. Massive, planet-wrecking strikes wasted\n> lives. Since an artificial intelligence could copy itself\n> indefinitely, Omnius would never surrender, not even in the face of\n> overwhelming military resistance. The evermind would be nearly\n> impervious . . . unless commando teams could move directly into a\n> machine control center, as they had done on Giedi Prime.\n>\n> Now, as he paced the breezy deck of the river barge, stars glimmered\n> overhead. Holtzman gazed ahead into the sheer rock walls of the Isana\n> canyon, a deep gorge formed by the torrential river. He could hear a\n> whispering rumble of rapids approaching, but knew the barge would\n> steer through a safe channel along one side. He let his mind wander.\n>\n> Smaller shields . . . personal shields. Perhaps the invisible armor\n> would not stop slow projectiles, but they would be proof against most\n> military attacks. And the machines need never know the vulnerability.\n>\n> *Personal shields.*\n>\n> While the success and accolades might be less glorious, the new\n> defensive concept could still prove useful. In fact, it might save\n> billions of lives. People could wear the shields for personal\n> protection. Individuals, like tiny fortresses, could be made nearly\n> impervious to attack.\n>\n> Breathless, he returned to his luxurious cabin on the upper deck of\n> the barge, the interior of which was illuminated by one of Norma's\n> faceted glowglobes. Far into the night, he wrote and rewrote his\n> equations. Finally he studied his results with bleary, grainy eyes and\n> proudly labeled them the \"Holtzman Effect.\"\n>\n> *Yes, this will do nicely indeed.*\n>\n> He would summon a fast transport and return to Starda, downriver.

Scaffolds\n> hung down, laden with geometric tiles cut from fired river clay and\n> glazed with gem-based tints imported from Hagal.\n>\n> Seen from the decks of boats far below, the mural would be\n> breathtaking. But suspended in a harness up close, Ishmael could not\n> identify details. He saw only a blurry honeycomb of tiles, one color\n> after another laid down with foul-smelling epoxies.\n>\n> In a sling beside him, Aliid noisily trimmed tiles to fit into place.\n> Machine sounds ricocheted across the canyon: rock saws, pointed\n> hammers, power chisels. Lamenting his stolen life, Aliid sang a song\n> from IV Anbus as he worked. Ishmael joined in with a similar ballad\n> about Harmonthep.\n>\n> Hanging ten meters below in his own harness, a boy named Ebbin\n> composed an impromptu musical chant describing his home of Souci, a\n> habitable moon so isolated that neither Aliid nor Ishmael had heard of\n> it. The Tlulaxa slavers, it seemed, were adept at finding lost\n> Buddislamic refugees, persecuting Zensunnis and Zenshiites alike.\n>\n> On the long ropes and harnesses, boys proved more agile and energetic\n> than grown men or women. They could scramble over the granite to lay\n> down colored tiles while cool winds whistled through the canyon. The\n> overseers expected no trouble.\n>\n> They were wrong.\n>\n> With simmering resentment, Aliid often repeated the defiant words of\n> Bel Moulay. The fiery Zenshiite leader dreamed of a time when slaves\n> could throw off their chains and live free again, returning to IV\n> Anbus or Harmonthep or even mysterious Souci. Ishmael listened to the\n> foolish talk, but didn't want to add kindling to Aliid's fire.\n>\n> Remembering his compassionate grandfather, Ishmael remained a patient\n> pacifist.

When\n> seen from the air, these transient art pieces changed like\n> kaleidoscopic images. Each season the flowers grew in patterns, then\n> went to seed and gradually formed more random congregations as winds\n> disturbed the planter's palette.\n>\n> From where Bludd watched, surrounded by mumbling sycophants, the slave\n> boys looked like insects crawling along the opposite wall. He heard\n> their equipment noises and the faint, high tones of young voices.\n>\n> The work was progressing well. Giant figures, faces, and starships\n> covered the granite: an epic depiction of the settlement of Poritrin\n> and the intentional destruction of all computers, which returned the\n> planet to a bucolic existence, dependent upon slave labor.\n>\n> A man of great pride, Bludd knew the faces of his ancestors well.\n> Unfortunately, as he studied the interplay of light and color on the\n> unfinished mosaic, he found himself dissatisfied with the face of old\n> Favo. Though the mosaic pattern precisely followed the image that had\n> been laser-etched onto the granite, now that he saw the result larger\n> than life, Niko Bludd was not pleased. \"Look at the face of Lord Favo.\n> Do you agree that it is inaccurate?\"\n>\n> Everyone in his party concurred immediately. He called over the\n> project supervisor, explained the problem, and ordered removal of the\n> tiles on the face of Favo Bludd, pending a redesign of his features.\n>\n> The work boss hesitated for just a moment, then nodded.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> DANGLING IN THEIR harnesses, Ishmael and Aliid let out simultaneous\n> groans as the outrageous instructions came down. On their ropes they\n> slid back over to the already-completed surface. Ishmael hung before\n> the huge geometric pattern that formed the eye of the old nobleman.\n>\n> Angrily, Aliid set his protective goggles in place, then swung a rock\n> hammer to smash the tiles, as instructed. Alongside his friend,\n> Ishmael chipped and pounded. Ironically, removing the tiles was more\n> difficult than installing them in the first place. The epoxy was\n> harder than the granite itself, so they had no choice but to shatter\n> the mosaic and let the shards tumble down into the river.\n>\n> Aliid groused at the pointlessness of their labors. Being a slave was\n> bad enough, but it infuriated him to redo massive work because some\n> arrogant master changed his mind. He swung his hammer harder than\n> necessary, as if envisioning the heads of his enemies--- and the\n> ricochet was enough to knock the tool loose from his grip. The hammer\n> fell, and he yelled, \"Look out below!\"\n>\n> Young Ebbin tried to scramble out of the way, his feet and arms\n> slipping as he moved across the polished rock. The hammer clipped him\n> on the shoulder, slicing the torso strap of his harness.\n>\n> Ebbin slipped, one-half of his support cut away, his collarbone\n> broken. He screamed and scrabbled, grabbing at the remaining harness\n> loop that dug into his right underarm. His feet slid on the polished\n> mosaic tiles.\n>\n> Ishmael tried to move sideways so that he could reach the taut cable\n> that held Ebbin. Aliid worked just as hard to drop down to where he\n> could support the boy from Souci.\n>\n> Ebbin kicked and thrashed. He dropped his own hammer, letting it fall\n> to the foamy ribbon of water far below. Ishmael grabbed the boy's\n> single remaining rope and held it, but didn't know what else to do.\n>\n> Above, slaves along the canyon rim began to haul on the cable, lifting\n> the struggling boy. But Ebbin's left arm hung limp, and with a broken\n> clavicle he could do little to help himself. The cable snagged on a\n> rock burr. Ishmael pulled the rope in an attempt to free it, his teeth\n> clenched. The boy was only a few feet beneath him now.\n>\n> Desperately, Ebbin reached up with one hand, clawing at the air.\n> Ishmael stretched downward, still grasping the cable but trying to\n> extend his free arm to meet the boy's grasp.\n>\n> Suddenly the workers on the canyon rim shouted in dismay. Ishmael\n> heard a snap as the rope broke far above.\n>\n> The line in his hand went limp, and Ishmael lurched wildly, grasping\n> at his harness. The fibrous cord that held Ebbin spun through his\n> clenched palm, burning skin. Ebbin reached up, in spite of his injury,\n> and his fingers barely missed Ishmael's. Then the boy dropped free,\n> his mouth open wide, his eyes bright and disbelieving. The frayed end\n> of the support cable popped through Ishmael's scorched hands as the\n> rope ran out.\n>\n> Ebbin tumbled toward the waiting Isana. The thin band of churning\n> water was so far below that Ishmael did not even see a splash as the\n> boy struck. . . .\n>\n> Aliid and Ishmael were dragged up to the top of the cliff, where the\n> project boss grudgingly tended their rope burns and other bruises.\n>\n> Ishmael felt sick, nearly vomited.

After catching the\n> crew boss at his attempted treachery, Ajax had clamped a free-formed\n> artificial hand around the man's right bicep and dragged him away from\n> his workers, screaming and stumbling.\n>\n> The slaves had stopped their tasks, looking with horror and pity at\n> their supervisor, now fallen to the wrath of Ajax. The cymek paraded\n> with his terrified captive through the monument-shadowed streets and\n> finally carried him into a hollow building. With squared-off facades\n> and ornate stone-work, the structure was called the Hall of Justice.\n>\n> That seemed infinitely appropriate to Ajax.\n>\n> Like so many grand edifices of Earth's central city grid, the Hall of\n> Justice was merely a stage set designed to convey a sense of majesty\n> and grandeur. Inside, the hall was an empty shell without facilities,\n> only a floor of plazcrete.\n>\n> Ajax and the traitor could be alone here for a lengthy private\n> interrogation. The very idea of a revolt among the slaves amused him\n> with its na\u00efve absurdity, especially the possibility that a trustee\n> would add his support to such nonsense.\n>\n> With a thoughtrode impulse, he focused his myriad optic threads on the\n> whimpering captive. The terrified man had soiled himself and sobbed\n> pathetically, making more excuses than denials. No need to hurry. Best\n> to play this out for his own enjoyment.\n>\n> \"You plotted to overthrow the rule of thinking machines.\" Ajax kept\n> his voice firm and deep. \"Concocting tales of a widespread underground\n> resistance, with the foolish aim of making slaves rise up and somehow\n> gain a fairytale independence from Omnius.\"\n>\n> \"It's not true!\" the man wailed. \"I swear I didn't know what I was\n> doing. I was following instructions. I received messages---\"\n>\n> \"You received messages commanding you to commit sedition, and did not\n> report them to me?\" Ajax's ominous laugh made the poor fellow wet\n> himself. \"Instead, you surreptitiously passed the word among your work\n> crews.\"\n>\n> The evidence of sedition was incontrovertible, and Ajax expected to be\n> rewarded for dealing with the problem. Omnius was watching, after all.\n> Perhaps, the cymek thought, if he ferreted out the core of this\n> budding rebellion, he could claim a reward, even demand the\n> opportunity to fight in a spectacular gladiatorial combat, as\n> Barbarossa and Agamemnon had done.\n>\n> \"We must record this properly.\" Ajax strode forward on flexible\n> armored legs, swaying sets of exaggerated insectlike arms. He grabbed\n> the captive's left wrist and clamped down with a polymer-metal grasp.\n> \"Tell us your name.\"\n>\n> The trustee blubbered and pleaded, trying to flinch away. In a twinge\n> of anger, Ajax clenched his powerful gripper and snipped off the\n> sobbing captive's hand at the wrist. The man screamed, and blood\n> spurted, much of it raining onto the cymek's front set of optic\n> threads. Ajax cursed to himself. He had not meant to inflict so much\n> pain before the human even had the chance to answer simple questions.\n>\n> While the crew boss howled and thrashed, Ajax activated a hot blue\n> flamer and scorched the end of the severed wrist, crisping the stump.\n> \"There, it's cauterized.\" Ajax waited for the man to show some hint of\n> gratitude. \"Now answer the question. What is your name?\"\n>\n> Shaping another menacing claw from his flowing metal limb-tip, Ajax\n> grasped the man's other hand. The crew boss wailed unrelentingly, but\n> had the presence of mind to say, \"*Ohan*. Ohan Freer! That's my name.\n> Please, don't hurt me again.\"\n>\n> \"A good start.\" Ajax knew, though, that the hurting had just begun. He\n> especially enjoyed this part of his job, when he could improvise pain\n> and inflict it like a master designer.\n>\n> Some of the other Titans considered Ajax a loose cannon. But if a\n> leader couldn't show a little domination over a vanquished people,\n> what was the point of taking over the Old Empire in the first place?\n> Even in their glory days, Ajax had never been interested, like Xerxes,\n> in extravagant food and drink, or in a pampered lifestyle with toys\n> and pleasures like his own spoiled mate, Hecate.\n>\n> No, Ajax had joined the team for the sheer challenge of it. Early on,\n> when Tlaloc had made plans with his fellow conspirators, seductive\n> Juno had recruited Ajax to their cause. A tough and aggressive\n> fighter, Ajax had provided the muscle the Titans needed--- not just\n> physical strength, but the mindset of a warrior, a relentless\n> conqueror. Following the initial overthrow of the humans, he had done\n> his best to maintain order, regardless of the cost in the blood of\n> noncombatants.\n>\n> The vermin invariably attempted one uprising or another, but Ajax\n> easily extinguished these little brushfires. When the more organized\n> Hrethgir Rebellions threatened the Titans, Ajax had responded with\n> astonishing mayhem. He had gone to Walgis, the site of the rebellion's\n> initial sparks, and closed off the planet from space transportation.\n> He'd made a point of leaving communications open so that the doomed\n> populace could scream\n>\n> for help. That way, restless slaves on other Titan-controlled worlds\n> could experience the punishment vicariously.\n>\n> Then he set to work.\n>\n> The essential job had taken years, but Ajax finally succeeded in\n> exterminating every living human on Walgis--- committing most of the\n> murder with atomics, poison gas clouds, and customized diseases. To\n> finish off the survivors, Ajax had installed his brain canister inside\n> a monstrous and intimidating body and hunted the humans down like wild\n> animals. Accompanied by squads of Barbarossa's programmed robots, he\n> had burned cities, smashed buildings, ferreted out any human presence.\n> He killed every last one of the *hrethgir*, and enjoyed it\n> immeasurably.\n>\n> Truly, those had been the glory days of the Titans!\n>\n> The violence, however justified, had troubled his mate Hecate, the\n> weakest and most squeamish of the original twenty. Although she had\n> joined Tlaloc's rebellion to earn rewards for herself, she'd never\n> understood the necessities of the job and had gradually wilted from\n> it. After the Titans had sacrificed their human bodies in favor of an\n> immortal existence as cymeks, Hecate had remained with Ajax, all the\n> while trying unsuccessfully to change his personality. Despite their\n> disagreements, Ajax had been fond of her, though his need for a lover\n> had vanished with his physical form.\n>\n> Appalled at Ajax's bloodthirsty response to the Hrethgir Rebellions,\n> Hecate had \"resigned\" her position among the Titans. She wanted\n> nothing more to do with ruling humanity. Encased in a cymek body of\n> her own design, a long-range space vessel, Hecate simply departed,\n> leaving the remaining Titans to continue their death grip on humanity.\n>\n> Ironically, Hecate had chosen the perfect time to leave. Not long\n> after the obliteration of humans on Walgis, Xerxes's fatal error had\n> allowed the Omnius evermind to get loose. . . .\n>\n> Now, inside the blood-spattered Hall of Justice, Ajax raised his\n> intimidating body high. He powered up his systems so that neurelectric\n> fire gleamed\n>\n> through his insectlike limbs.\n>\n> The captive traitor screamed at the very thought of what was about to\n> happen to him.\n>\n> \"Now, Ohan Freer,\" Ajax said, \"let me ask you certain other questions.\n> I want you to pay close attention.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> BY COMMAND OF Omnius, the crew boss Iblis Ginjo brought his loyal\n> slaves into the Golden Age Square. Ajax was about to pronounce\n> sentence\n>\n> --- execution, no doubt--- upon a man he had taken captive, a crew\n> boss from another labor gang, Ohan Freer.\n>\n> Iblis had trained with the accused trustee in the special schools, but\n> he had never seen his fellow crew boss do anything illegal. Ajax\n> rarely needed much of an excuse, however. He himself had experienced\n> the Titan's displeasure more than once, but so far had managed to\n> survive. He doubted his compatriot would fare as well today.\n>\n> An ornate metal-worked column stood in the center of the square. A\n> roaring orange flame gushed from the top of the pillar, like an\n> ornamental smokestack. Fanciful facades of immense buildings, all\n> empty, surrounded the plaza like prison walls around a central\n> courtyard. Omnius's sentinel robots looked powerful and portentous in\n> formations along the sides of the square, ready to strike against any\n> perceived infraction by the expendable human slaves.\n>\n> Iblis guided his crew into the partitioned viewing areas, voicing a\n> few words of reassurance, though not enough to upset the cymeks. Ajax\n> loved showmanship, wanted to make certain every terrified eye\n> witnessed his actions. When Iblis and the other crew bosses blew\n> whistles to signal their readiness, Ajax emerged, carrying his maimed\n> prisoner.\n>\n> The Titan wore an antlike body with an impressive ellipsoidal core,\n> heavy walking legs, and four grasping arms in which he held Ohan\n> Freer.\n>\n> Hovering watcheyes captured images and fed a steady stream of data to\n> the evermind.\n>\n> Beneath the flaming pillar, Ajax clutched the squirming victim like a\n> giant ant soldier with a hapless enemy beetle. Doomed Ohan had been\n> burned, bloodied, and wounded; his left hand was only a charred stump.\n> Blossoming bruises discolored his skin. A thin, watery wail leaked\n> from his mouth.\n>\n> A mutter of dismay came from the human onlookers. Watching them, Iblis\n> knew these workers could not have been the source of the rebellion,\n> despite the mysterious and provocative messages he had received. What\n> if he was deluding himself and the secret call to freedom was simply a\n> wishful suggestion voiced by another desperate person?\n>\n> Lifting the unfortunate captive high, Ajax amplified his vocal\n> synthesizers so that his words boomed like a projectile cannon around\n> the enclosed square. \"Some of you have heard this criminal speak. Some\n> of you may have had the poor judgment to listen to his silly\n> imaginings about freedom and rebellion. You would be wiser to cut off\n> your ears than listen to such foolishness.\"\n>\n> The crowd held its collective breath. Iblis bit his lower lip, not\n> wanting to watch, but fixated on the imminent horror. If he averted\n> his gaze, the watcheyes might well detect it, and he would hear about\n> it later. As a consequence, Iblis stared at every unfolding second.\n>\n> \"This poor, deluded man is no longer necessary to the continued glory\n> of Omnius in the reign of the thinking machines.\"\n>\n> Ohan screamed, and struggled weakly. Ajax held the man's intact arm in\n> one roughly formed pincer claw and each leg in two others. With his\n> last claw, Ajax wrapped a long, sharp embrace around Ohan's chest,\n> under his armpits.\n>\n> \"He is no longer a worker. He is no longer even *hrethgir*, one of the\n> unruly humans who survive at our own sufferance. He is *garbage*.\"\n> Ajax paused.\n>\n> \"And garbage is to be discarded.\"\n>\n> Then, without a sound or any sign of effort, Ajax pulled his\n> artificial limbs in different directions, tearing the helpless Ohan\n> asunder. The man's arms and legs ripped free, his chest tore open and\n> broken bones pierced skin. Blood and entrails spilled onto the clean\n> flagstones of the Golden Age Square.\n>\n> Ajax flung the bloody parts into the screaming crowd. \"Enough of this\n> nonsense! There is no rebellion. Now get back to work.\"\n>\n> The sickened workers seemed only too eager to race back to their\n> tasks, looking to Iblis as they left, as if he could protect them. But\n> Iblis still stared in disbelieving amazement. Ohan Freer had been a\n> member of the rebellion! The crew boss had spread dissent, made plans,\n> perhaps sent and received messages.\n>\n> *Another rebel!*\n>\n> Appalled, Iblis knew the danger to himself was even greater now, if he\n> continued to act. Nonetheless, today's execution had shown him one\n> thing more clearly than ever: The brewing human rebellion was not just\n> his imagination.\n>\n> *It is real!*\n>\n> If Ohan had been part of it, then there must be others, too--- many of\n> them. This underground network of fighters, which included Iblis, was\n> safely separated into cells so that no one could betray the others.\n> Now he understood.\n>\n> He began to make plans with even greater conviction than before.\n>\n> *Humans deny a continuum of possibilities, an infinite number of\n> realms into which their species may enter.*\n>\n> --- ERASMUS,\n\nnotes on human nature\n\n> **I**t was a makeshift performance hall, inside a marble-walled\n> building on the robot's estate. Erasmus had worked his slave crews to\n> modify the interior, install seats, and retool the walls, all to\n> create perfect acoustics for this single performance. Erasmus had\n> studied records of the greatest human classical music, knew exactly\n> what was expected of grand symphonies, from the audience to the\n> setting. He had high standards for his artistic endeavors.\n>\n> The robot invited Serena Butler, now in her eighth month of pregnancy,\n> to sit in a large central chair for the concert. \"These other people\n> might experience pleasure from the melody and the sounds, but you have\n> different expectations. On Salusa Secundus, sophisticated music was a\n> part of your existence.\"\n>\n> With a pang, Serena thought of her brother and his musical\n> aspirations. She had learned to appreciate the enduring works of\n> long-vanished human composers. \"Music is not the only thing I miss,\n> Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \"You and I speak the same cultured language,\" he said, not noticing\n> her pointed remark. \"You will tell me how you enjoy this composition.\n> I had you in mind when I wrote it.\"\n>\n> He filled the performance hall with worker-caste slaves culled from a\n> variety of skilled labor assignments. They were cleaned up and dressed\n> according to Erasmus's concept of a high-class audience.\n>\n> Electronic portraits of great human composers lined the interior\n> walls, as if the robot wanted to count himself among their number.\n> Around the perimeter of the concert hall, museum-type display cases\n> held musical\n>\n> instruments--- a lute, a rebec, a gilded tambour, and an antique\n> fifteen-string baliset with inlaid vabalone shells on its case.\n>\n> In the center of the mezzanine stage beneath open rafters, Erasmus sat\n> alone before a grand piano, surrounded by music synthesizers,\n> speakers, and a sound-misting station. Wearing a formal black suit\n> with a cut similar to a tuxedo but redesigned to accommodate his\n> robotic body, Erasmus sat at attention, his face a smooth mirrored\n> oval, showing no expression.\n>\n> Shifting to find a more comfortable position for her back, Serena\n> watched the inquisitor robot. She rested a hand on her enormous\n> abdomen, felt the movements of the restless baby. Within weeks, she\n> would deliver her child.\n>\n> Around her, the captive audience shifted uneasily, not sure what to\n> expect, or what was expected of them. Erasmus turned his mirrored face\n> toward the audience, reflecting them as he waited, and waited. Finally\n> silence fell.\n>\n> \"Thank you for your attention.\" He turned to a shiny silver apparatus\n> beside him, a music synthesizer with dancing polymer fingertips that\n> produced familiar riffs and chords. The background music increased in\n> volume, laced with stringed instruments and mournful Chusuk horns.\n>\n> The robot listened for several moments, then continued, \"You are about\n> to experience something truly remarkable. To demonstrate my respect\n> for the creative spirit, I have composed a new symphony especially for\n> you, my hardworking slaves. No human has ever heard it before.\"\n>\n> He played a rapid mixture of melodies on the piano, running through\n> three short passages in an apparent effort to confirm that the\n> instrument was tuned properly. \"After detailed analysis of the field,\n> I have written a symphony comparable to the works of the great human\n> composers Johannes Brahms and Emi Chusuk. I developed my piece\n> according to strict principles of order and mathematics.\"\n>\n> Serena perused the audience, doubting any of the humans raised in\n> captivity were familiar with the classical music the robot had\n> mentioned. Schooled on Salusa Secundus, where music and art were\n> integral parts of the culture,\n>\n> Serena had listened to the renowned works of many composers, even\n> discussing them at length with Fredo.\n>\n> With a mental pulse Erasmus linked his gelcircuitry mind to the\n> synthesizer, producing a strange, repetitious melody. Then his\n> mechanical fingers danced over the keyboard, and he made frequent\n> sweeping gestures as he played, as if imitating a famous concert\n> pianist.\n>\n> Serena found the composition pleasant enough, but unremarkable. And,\n> although she did not recognize the precise melody, it had a strangely\n> familiar character, as if the robot had mathematically analyzed an\n> existing piece measure by measure and followed the pattern, changing a\n> rhythm here, a polyphonic passage there. The music felt lackluster,\n> with no powerful driving force.\n>\n> Erasmus apparently believed it was a human instinct to appreciate a\n> new work, that his captive audience would intrinsically note the\n> nuances and complexities of his structurally perfect composition. The\n> slaves around Serena shifted in their seats and listened; to them,\n> this was a pleasant enough diversion but just another work assignment.\n> The conscripted audience seemed to enjoy the soothing notes of the\n> melody, but it did not move them in the way the robot desired.\n>\n> When at last he ceased his performance, Erasmus sat back from the\n> piano, deactivated the symphonic support equipment, and let the\n> silence deepen. The reverberating tones faded.\n>\n> For a moment, the slaves hesitated as if waiting for instructions.\n> Erasmus said, \"You may give an ovation if you enjoyed the piece.\" They\n> didn't seem to understand the reference, until he said, \"Signify by\n> clapping your hands.\"\n>\n> An initial wave of applause came as a sparse patter like raindrops,\n> then swelled into louder clapping--- as was expected of them. Serena\n> joined in politely, though not enthusiastically. A small act of\n> honesty that she was sure Erasmus would notice.\n>\n> The robot's shining mask had shifted into a proud smile. In his formal\n> black garment he walked smoothly down a staircase from the mezzanine\n> stage to the main floor. The slaves continued to applaud, and he\n> basked in the apparent adulation. When the acclamation receded, he\n> summoned sentinel guards to escort the audience back to their regular\n> work assignments.\n>\n> Serena could see that Erasmus believed he had created an enduring work\n> of merit that possibly surpassed what humans had achieved. But she\n> didn't want to discuss it with him, and tried to slip away to her\n> greenhouse work. She moved slowly because of her pregnancy, however,\n> and Erasmus caught up with her. \"Serena Butler, I wrote this symphony\n> for your benefit. Are you not impressed by it?\"\n>\n> She selected her words carefully, avoiding a candid answer. \"Perhaps I\n> am simply sad because your symphony reminds me of other performances I\n> watched on Salusa Secundus. My late brother wanted to be a musician.\n> Those were happier times for me.\"\n>\n> He looked at her closely, his optic threads sparkling. \"Nuances of\n> human behavior tell me that my symphony has disappointed you. Explain\n> why.\"\n>\n> \"You don't want an honest opinion.\"\n>\n> \"You misjudge me, for I am a seeker of truth. Anything else is faulty\n> data.\" His cherubic expression caused her to lower her guard. \"Is\n> there something wrong with the acoustics in this hall?\"\n>\n> \"It's nothing to do with the acoustics. I'm sure you tested everything\n> to technical perfection.\" The audience continued to move toward the\n> exits, some looking over their shoulders at Serena with pity that the\n> robot had taken a special interest in her. \"It was the symphony\n> itself.\"\n>\n> \"Continue,\" Erasmus said. His voice was flat.\n>\n> \"You assembled that piece, you didn't *create* it. It was based on\n> precise models developed ages ago by human composers. The only\n> creativity I heard came from their minds, not yours. Your music was a\n> mathematical\n>\n> extrapolation, but nothing that inspired me in any way. The tune you .\n> . .*engineered* evoked no images or feelings within me. There was no\n> fresh element that you contributed, nothing emotionally compelling.\"\n>\n> \"How am I to quantify such an ingredient?\"\n>\n> Forcing a smile, Serena shook her head. \"Therein lies your mistake,\n> Erasmus. It is impossible to quantify creativity. How does a person\n> hear a thunderstorm and use that experience to write the 'William Tell\n> Overture'? You would simply imitate the sounds of thunder and rain,\n> Erasmus, but you wouldn't *evoke the impression* of a storm. How did\n> Beethoven look at a peaceful meadow and adapt that experience into his\n> 'Pastorale'? Music should make the spirit soar, take the breath away,\n> touch the soul. Your work was just . . . pleasant tones, adequately\n> performed.\"\n>\n> The robot took several seconds to change the expression on his face,\n> and finally looked at her with perplexity, even defensiveness. \"Your\n> opinion seems to be in the minority. The rest of the audience greatly\n> appreciated the work. Did you not notice their applause?\"\n>\n> She sighed. \"First of all, those slaves have no knowledge of music, no\n> basis of comparison. You could have stolen any symphony from a\n> classical composer, note for note, and called it your own. They\n> wouldn't have known the difference.\n>\n> \"Second, sitting in a concert hall--- comfortable, clean, and\n> well-dressed--- is probably the best work assignment you've ever given\n> them. Why wouldn't they clap for that reason alone?\"\n>\n> She looked at him. \"Finally, and most important, you *told* them to\n> applaud. How are they supposed to react, when they know you could have\n> them killed at any moment? Under such circumstances, Erasmus, you will\n> never get a fair and honest response.\"\n>\n> \"I do not understand, cannot understand.\" Erasmus repeated this\n> several times. Abruptly, he whirled and swung a hardened fist into the\n> face of a\n>\n> man who walked past. The unexpected blow sent the victim crashing over\n> the chairs, bleeding.\n>\n> \"Why did you do that?\" Serena demanded, rushing over to help the man.\n>\n> \"Artistic temperament,\" Erasmus said calmly. \"Is that not what humans\n> call it? He tried to deceive me about how he really felt.\"\n>\n> She tried to soothe the man, but when he looked up to see the robot,\n> the slave struggled away, holding a hand up to stop the blood dripping\n> from his nose. Serena rounded on Erasmus. \"True artists are sensitive\n> and compassionate. They don't need to *hurt* people to make them\n> feel.\"\n>\n> \"You are not afraid to voice your opinion, even when you believe it\n> might displease me?\"\n>\n> Serena looked directly into his unnatural face. \"You hold me prisoner,\n> Erasmus. You claim to want my opinion, so I give it. You can hurt me,\n> even murder me, but you have already taken me away from my life and\n> the man I love. Any further pain pales in comparison.\"\n>\n> Erasmus stared at her, assessing what she had said. \"Humans are\n> perplexing to me--- and you more than anyone, Serena Butler.\" His\n> flowmetal countenance took on a smiling expression. \"But I will keep\n> trying to understand. Thank you for your insights.\"\n>\n> As Serena left the hall, Erasmus returned to the piano and began\n> practicing.\n>\n> *Above all, I am a man of honor.

Around him, the conspirators waited like huge insects made\n> of scrap metal. \"For years, I have been suggesting that we exterminate\n> the human captives on the Synchronized Worlds, but Omnius refuses.\"\n>\n> \"Maybe he's reluctant because humans created thinking machines in the\n> first place,\" Xerxes suggested. \"Omnius might see humans as a\n> manifestation of God.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon chided him. \"Are you suggesting that the computer evermind\n> is devoutly religious?\" The disgraced cymek quickly fell silent.\n>\n> Barbarossa said, like a patient teacher, \"No, no--- Omnius simply\n> doesn't wish to expend the energy or cause the turmoil that such an\n> extermination would bring about. He sees humans as resources, not to\n> be wasted.\"\n>\n> \"We've been trying to convince him otherwise for centuries,\" Ajax\n> said.\n>\n> Aware that their safe window of time was rapidly dwindling, Agamemnon\n> pushed the discussion forward. \"We must find some way to spark a\n> radical change. If we shut the computers down, then we Titans rule\n> once more, along with any neo-cymeks we can recruit.\" He swiveled his\n> sensor-turret. \"We've taken charge before and must do it again.\"\n>\n> Previously, when the human Titans had consolidated the stagnant Old\n> Empire, combat robots had done the bulk of the fighting for them.\n> Tlaloc, Agamemnon, and the other rebels had simply picked up the\n> pieces. This time the Titans would have to fight for themselves.\n>\n> \"Maybe we should try to find Hecate,\" Xerxes said. \"She's the only one\n> of us who has never been under Omnius's control. Our wild card.\"\n>\n> Hecate, the former mate of Ajax, was the sole Titan who had\n> relinquished her rule. Before the thinking machine takeover, she had\n> departed into deep space, never to be heard from again. But Agamemnon\n> could never trust her\n>\n> --- even if she could be located--- any more than he trusted Xerxes.\n> Hecate had abandoned them long ago; she was not the ally they needed.\n>\n> \"We should look elsewhere for assistance, take any help we can find,\"\n> Agamemnon said. \"My son Vorian is one of the few humans allowed access\n> to the central complex of the Earth-Omnius, and he delivers regular\n> updates to the everminds on other Synchronized Worlds. Perhaps we can\n> use him.\"\n>\n> Juno simulated a laugh. \"You want to trust a human, my love? One of\n> the weak vermin you despise? Moments ago you wanted to exterminate\n> every member of the race.\"\n>\n> \"Vorian is my genetic son, and the best of my offspring so far. I have\n> been watching him, training him. He has read my memoirs a dozen times\n> already. I have high hopes that one day he will be a worthy\n> successor.\"\n>\n> Juno understood Agamemnon better than the other Titans did. \"You've\n> said similar things about your twelve previous sons, if I recall. Even\n> so, you found excuses to kill all of them.\"\n>\n> \"I preserved plenty of my sperm before converting myself into a cymek,\n> and I have the time to do it right,\" Agamemnon said. \"But Vorian . . .\n> ah, Vorian, I think he might be the one. One day I'll let him become a\n> cymek.\"\n>\n> Ajax interrupted, his voice pitched low, \"We cannot fight two major\n> enemies at once. Since Omnius has finally allowed us to attack the\n> *hrethgir,*\n>\n> thanks to Barbarossa's victory in the gladiator ring, I say we\n> prosecute that war to the best of our abilities. Afterward, we deal\n> with Omnius.\"\n>\n> Immersed in the crater shadows, the cymeks muttered, half-agreeing.\n> The League humans had escaped Titan rule centuries ago, and the old\n> cymeks had always harbored a hatred toward them. Dante's optic threads\n> tracked back and forth, calculating. \"Yes, the humans should be easier\n> to defeat.\"\n>\n> \"Meanwhile, we continue to seek a means to eliminate Omnius,\"\n> Barbarossa added. \"Everything in its time.\"\n>\n> \"Perhaps you are correct,\" Agamemnon admitted. The cymek general did\n> not want to extend this clandestine gathering much longer.\n>\n> He led the march back to their individual ships. \"We destroy the\n> League humans first. Using that as a springboard, we then turn our\n> attention to the more difficult foe.\"\n>\n> *Logic is blind and often knows only its own past.*\n>\n> --- archives from *Genetics to Philosophy,*\n>\n> compiled by the Sorceresses of Rossak\n>\n> **T**hinking machines cared little for aesthetics, but the Omnius\n> update ship was--- by accident of design--- a beautifully sleek\n> silver-and-black vessel, dwarfed by the immensity of the cosmos as it\n> journeyed from one Synchronized World to another. Finished with its\n> current round of updates, the *Dream Voyager* was on its way back to\n> Earth.\n>\n> Vorian Atreides considered himself fortunate to be entrusted with such\n> a vital assignment. Born from a female slave impregnated with\n> Agamemnon's preserved sperm, dark-haired Vorian could trace his\n> lineage back past the Time of Titans, thousands of years to the House\n> of Atreus in ancient Greece and another famous Agamemnon. Because of\n> his father's status, twenty-year-old Vor had been raised and\n> indoctrinated on Earth under the thinking machines. He was one of the\n> privileged \"trustee\" humans permitted to move about freely, serving\n> Omnius.\n>\n> He had read all the stories of his illustrious bloodline in the\n> extensive memoirs his father had written to document his triumphs. Vor\n> considered the Titan general's great work to be more than a literary\n> masterpiece, closer to a holy historical document.\n>\n> Just forward of Vor's work station, the *Dream Voyager*'s captain, an\n> autonomous robot, checked instruments unerringly. Seurat's\n> coppery-metal skinfilm flowed over a man-shaped body of polymer\n> struts, alloy supports, gelcircuitry processors, and wound\n> elastic-weave musculature.\n>\n> While Seurat studied the instruments, he intermittently tapped into\n> the ship's long-range scanners or looked out the windowport with\n> focused optic threads. Multiprocessing as he conversed, the robot\n> captain continued the interplay with his subservient human copilot.\n> Seurat had a strange and unfortunate penchant for telling odd jokes.\n>\n> \"Vorian, what do you get when you breed a pig with a human?\"\n>\n> \"What?\"\n>\n> \"A creature that still eats a great deal, still stinks, and still does\n> no work!\"\n>\n> Vorian favored the captain with a polite chuckle. Most of the time,\n> Seurat's jokes only demonstrated that the robot did not truly\n> understand humor. But if Vor didn't laugh, Seurat would simply tell\n> another one, and another, until he obtained the desired reaction.\n> \"Aren't you afraid you'll make an error by telling jokes while\n> monitoring our navigation systems?\"\n>\n> \"I don't make mistakes,\" Seurat said, in his staccato mechanical\n> voice.\n>\n> Vor brightened with the challenge. \"Ah, but what if I sabotaged one of\n> the ship's vital functions? We're the only ones aboard, and I *am* a\n> deceitful human after all, your mortal enemy. It would serve you right\n> for all those terrible jokes.\"\n>\n> \"I might expect that of a lowly slave or even an artisan worker, but\n> *you* would never do that, Vorian. You have too much to lose.\" With an\n> eerily smooth movement, Seurat turned his rippled coppery head, paying\n> even less attention to the *Dream Voyager*'s controls. \"And even if\n> you did, I would figure it out.\"\n>\n> \"Don't underestimate me, old Metalmind. My father teaches me that,\n> despite our many weaknesses, we humans have a trump card with our very\n> unpredictability.\" Smiling, Vorian went to the robot captain's side\n> and studied the metric screens. \"Why do you think Omnius asks me to\n> throw a wrench into his careful simulations every time he plans an\n> encounter with the *hrethgir*?\"\n>\n> \"Your outrageous and reckless chaos is the only reason you are able to\n> beat me in any strategy game,\" Seurat said. \"It certainly has nothing\n> to do with your innate skills.\"\n>\n> \"A winner has more skills than a loser,\" Vor said, \"no matter how you\n> define the competition.\"\n>\n> The update ship traveled on a regular, continuous route throughout the\n> Synchronized Worlds. One of fifteen such vessels, the *Dream Voyager*\n> carried copies of the current version of Omnius to synchronize the\n> separate computer everminds on widely separated planets.\n>\n> Circuitry limitations and electronic transmission speeds constrained\n> the physical size of any individual machine; thus, the same computer\n> evermind could not viably extend beyond a single planet. Nonetheless,\n> duplicate copies of Omnius existed everywhere, like mental clones.\n> With regular updates continually exchanged by ships like the *Dream\n> Voyager*, all the separate Omnius incarnations remained virtually\n> identical across the machine-dominated autarchy.\n>\n> After many voyages, Vor knew how to operate the ship and could access\n> all onboard data banks using Seurat's codes. Over the years, he and\n> the robot captain had become fast friends in a way that others were\n> not likely to understand. Because of the extended time they shared in\n> deep space, talking about many things, playing games of skill, telling\n> stories--- they bridged much of the gap between machine and man.\n>\n> Sometimes, for amusement, Vor and Seurat traded places, and Vor\n> pretended to be the captain of the ship, while Seurat became his\n> robotic underling, as in the days of the Old Empire. During one\n> role-playing session, Vorian had impulsively christened the ship\n> *Dream Voyager*, a bit of poetic nonsense that Seurat not only\n> tolerated, but maintained.\n>\n> As a sentient machine, Seurat routinely received new instructions and\n> memory transfers from the overall Omnius brain, but because he spent\n> so much time disconnected while journeying between the stars, he had\n> developed his own personality and independence. In Vor's opinion,\n> Seurat was the best of the machine minds, although the robot could be\n> irritating at times. Especially with that peculiar sense of humor.\n>\n> Vor clasped his hands and cracked his knuckles. He sighed with\n> pleasure. \"Sure feels good to loosen up. Too bad it's something you\n> can't do.\"\n>\n> \"I do not require loosening up.\"\n>\n> Vorian didn't admit that he, too, found his own organic body to be\n> inferior in many ways, fragile and prone to aches, sicknesses, and\n> injuries that any machine could have easily fixed. He hoped that his\n> physical form would remain functional long enough for him to be made\n> into one of the enduring neo-cymeks, all of whom had once been valued\n> trustee humans, like himself. One day Agamemnon would receive\n> permission from Omnius for that, if Vor worked very hard to serve the\n> evermind.\n>\n> The *Dream Voyager* had been in space on a long update run, and the\n> young trustee was glad to be going home. He would see his eminent\n> father soon.\n>\n> As the *Dream Voyager* soared between stars, undisturbed, Seurat\n> suggested a friendly competition. The two sat at a table and engaged\n> in one of their customary diversions, an amusing private game they had\n> developed through frequent practice. The strategy involved an\n> imaginary space battle between two alien races--- the \"Vorians\" and\n> the \"Seurats\"--- each of which had a space fleet with precise\n> capabilities and limitations. Though the robot captain had a perfect\n> machine memory, Vor still fared well, as he invariably came up with\n> creative tactics that surprised his opponent.\n>\n> Now, as they took turns placing warships in the various sectors of\n> their fanciful space battlefield, Seurat reeled off an endless\n> succession of human jokes and riddles he had found in his old\n> databases. Annoyed, Vor finally said, \"You're making an overt attempt\n> to distract me. Where did you learn to do that?\"\n>\n> \"Why, from you, of course.\" The robot proceeded to mention the many\n> times in which Vor had teased him, threatening to sabotage the ship\n> without ever really intending to do so, concocting extraordinarily\n> unpredictable emergencies. \"Do you consider it cheating? On your part,\n> or on mine?\"\n>\n> This revelation astonished Vor. \"It saddens me to think that, even in\n> jest, I have taught you deception. It makes me ashamed to be human.\"\n> No doubt, Agamemnon would be disappointed in him.\n>\n> After two more rounds, Vor lost the tactical game. His heart was no\n> longer in it.\n>\n> *Every endeavor is a game, is it not?*\n\n--- IBLIS GINJO,\n\n*Options for Total Liberation*\n\n> **O**n a garden terrace overlooking the scarred ruins of Zimia, Xavier\n> Harkonnen stood somberly by himself, dreading the upcoming \"victory\"\n> parade. Afternoon sunlight warmed his face. Birdsong had replaced the\n> screams and explosions; breezes had scoured away the worst of the\n> poisonous smoke.\n>\n> Still, the League would be a long time recovering. Nothing would ever\n> be the same.\n>\n> Even days after the attack, he still saw smears of smoke wafting from\n> the rubble and trailing into a cloudless sky. He could not smell the\n> soot, though. The cymeks' poison gas had so damaged his tissues that\n> he would never smell or taste much of anything again. Even breathing\n> had become no more that a mechanical act, not an enjoyable inhalation\n> of sweet fresh air.\n>\n> But he could not wallow in misery when so many others had lost much\n> more. In the aftermath of the cymek attack, he had been kept alive by\n> the heroic efforts of a Salusan medical team. Serena Butler had come\n> to him at the hospital, but he remembered her only through a fog of\n> pain, drugs, and life-support systems. In an extraordinary procedure,\n> Xavier had received a double lung transplant, healthy organs provided\n> by the mysterious Tlulaxa. He knew Serena had worked vigorously with\n> the brilliant battlefield surgeons and a Tlulaxa flesh merchant named\n> Tuk Keedair to get him the treatment he needed.\n>\n> Now he could breathe again, despite intermittent bursts of pain.\n> Xavier would live to fight the machines another time. Thanks to\n> pharmaceuticals and advanced healing techniques, he had been able to\n> leave the hospital soon after the medical procedure.\n>\n> At the time of the attack, the flesh merchant Keedair had been in\n> Zimia on a routine sales call and barely escaped with his life. On the\n> Unallied Planet of Tlulax in the distant Thalim solar system, his\n> people ran organ farms, growing human hearts, lungs, kidneys, and\n> other body parts from viable cells. After the cymeks were driven away,\n> the secretive Tlulaxa had offered his biological wares to the\n> battlefield surgeons at Zimia's main field hospital. His ship's\n> cryogenic lockers were filled with sample body parts. A stroke of\n> luck, Keedair had admitted with a smile, that he could be there to\n> help the grievously injured Salusan citizens during their time of\n> great need.\n>\n> Following the successful surgery, Keedair had come to see Xavier in\n> the medical center. The Tlulaxa was a man of middle height but slight\n> of build, with dark eyes and an angular face. A long, dark braid hung\n> at the left side of his head, plaited tightly.\n>\n> Breathing in, carefully modulating his raspy voice, Xavier said, \"It\n> was fortunate you were here with new organs already stored aboard your\n> ship.\"\n>\n> Keedair rubbed his long-fingered hands together. \"If I had known the\n> cymeks would strike so ferociously, I would have brought a larger\n> supply of material from our organ farms. Your Salusan survivors could\n> use many more replacement parts, but additional ships cannot arrive\n> from the Thalim system for months.\"\n>\n> Before the flesh merchant left Xavier's room, he turned back and said,\n> \"Consider yourself one of the lucky ones, Tercero Harkonnen.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> IN BATTLE-SCARRED ZIMIA, grief-stricken survivors searched for their\n> dead, and buried them. As rubble was cleared, the death toll mounted.\n> Bodies were recovered, names of the missing were compiled. In spite of\n> such pain and sorrow, because of the attack free humanity grew\n> stronger.\n>\n> Viceroy Manion Butler had insisted that the people show only\n> determination in the aftermath. On the streets below Xavier's terrace,\n> final preparations were under way for a celebration of thanksgiving.\n> Banners\n>\n> with the open-hand sigil of human freedom fluttered in the wind.\n> Rough-looking men in dirty coats struggled to control magnificent\n> white Salusan stallions that had become agitated by the commotion. The\n> horses' manes were braided with tassles and bells, and their tails\n> swept behind them like waterfalls of fine hair. Festooned with ribbons\n> and flowers, the animals pranced, eager to march down the broad\n> central boulevard that had been washed clean of debris, soot, and\n> bloodstains.\n>\n> Xavier glanced uncertainly at the sky. How could he ever look at the\n> clouds again without dreading that he might see more pyramidal\n> dropcarriages plunging through the scrambler shields? Missiles were\n> already being installed, increased batteries to protect against an\n> attack from space. More patrols would be launched, circling the system\n> on the highest state of alert.\n>\n> Instead of attending a parade, he should be preparing the Salusan\n> Militia for another attack, increasing the number of picket ships and\n> scouts at the edge of the system, working out a more efficient rescue\n> and response plan. It was only a matter of time before the thinking\n> machines returned.\n>\n> The next meeting of the League Parliament would devote itself to\n> emergency measures and reparations. The representatives would sketch\n> out a reconstruction plan for Zimia. The cymek warrior-forms left\n> behind must be dismantled and analyzed for weaknesses.\n>\n> Xavier hoped the League would immediately dispatch a summons to\n> Poritrin, calling the brilliant Tio Holtzman to inspect his recently\n> installed scrambler shields. Only the great inventor himself could\n> devise a stopgap measure against the technical flaw the cymeks had\n> discovered.\n>\n> When Xavier mentioned his concerns to Viceroy Butler, the florid-faced\n> leader had nodded, but stopped further discussion. \"First, we must\n> have a day of affirmation, to celebrate the fact that we are alive.\"\n> Xavier saw deep sadness behind the Viceroy's mask of confidence. \"We\n> are not machines, Xavier. There must be more to our lives than war and\n> revenge.\"\n>\n> Hearing footsteps on the terrace, Xavier turned to see Serena Butler\n> smiling at him, her eyes flashing with a secret depth that she shared\n> with him now\n>\n> that no one could see the two of them. \"There is my heroic tercero.\"\n>\n> \"A man responsible for letting half a city be destroyed isn't usually\n> called a hero, Serena.\"\n>\n> \"No, but the term does apply to a man who saved the rest of the\n> planet. As you are fully aware, if you hadn't made your hard choice,\n> all of Zimia, all of Salusa, would have been crushed.\" She put a hand\n> on his shoulder and stood very close to him. \"I won't have you\n> wallowing in guilt during the victory parade. One day won't make much\n> difference.\"\n>\n> \"One day could very well make a *huge* difference,\" Xavier insisted.\n> \"We barely drove off the attackers this time because we were too\n> confident in the new scrambler shields, and because we foolishly\n> thought Omnius had decided to leave us alone after so many decades.\n> This would be the perfect time for them to hit us again. What if\n> they've launched a second wave?\"\n>\n> \"Omnius is still licking his wounds. I doubt his force has even\n> returned to the Synchronized Worlds yet.\"\n>\n> \"Machines don't lick wounds,\" he said.\n>\n> \"You're such a serious young man,\" she said. \"Please, just for the\n> parade? Our people need to have their spirits uplifted.\"\n>\n> \"Your father already gave me the same lecture.\"\n>\n> \"You know, of course, that if two Butlers say a thing, it's bound to\n> be true.\"\n>\n> He gave Serena a firm hug, then followed her from the terrace toward\n> the parade reviewing stand, where he would sit in a place of honor\n> beside the Viceroy.\n>\n> Since they'd been children, Xavier had always found himself attracted\n> to Serena; as they matured, they had grown confident of their\n> deepening feelings toward each other. Both he and Serena considered it\n> a foregone\n>\n> conclusion that they would wed, a rare perfect match of politics,\n> acceptable bloodlines, and romance.\n>\n> Now, though, with the sudden increase in hostilities, he reminded\n> himself of his greater priorities. Thanks to the disaster that had\n> killed Primero Meach, Xavier Harkonnen was interim commander of the\n> Salusan Militia, which forced him to face larger issues. He wanted to\n> do so much, but he was only one man.\n>\n> An hour later, the assemblage sat on a grandstand in the central\n> plaza. Scaffolding and temporary girders shored up the broken facades\n> of government buildings. The ornamental fountains no longer\n> functioned, but the citizens of Zimia knew there could be no other\n> place for such a presentation.\n>\n> Even burned and damaged, the tall edifices looked magnificent:\n> constructed in Salusan Gothic style with multilevel roof lines,\n> spires, and carved columns. Salusa Secundus was the seat of the League\n> government, but it also hosted the leading cultural and\n> anthropological museums. In surrounding neighborhoods, the crowded\n> dwellings were of simpler construction but pleasing to the eye,\n> whitewashed with lime taken from chalk cliffs. Salusans prided\n> themselves on having the best craftsmen and artisans in the League.\n> They did most of their production by hand instead of with automated\n> machinery.\n>\n> Along the parade route, the citizens dressed in colorful raiment of\n> magenta, blue, and yellow. People chattered and pointed as the\n> remarkable stallions passed them, followed by marching musicians and\n> folk dancers on hover-floats. One monstrous Salusan bull, drugged into\n> a near stupor to control it, plodded down the street.\n>\n> Though Xavier made the best of it all, he found himself constantly\n> glancing at the sky, and at the scars of the wounded city. . . .\n>\n> At the conclusion of the parade, Manion Butler delivered a speech\n> celebrating the successful defense but acknowledging the high cost of\n> the battle, tens of thousands killed or wounded. \"We have much healing\n> and\n>\n> recovery to do, but we also have an unbroken spirit, no matter what\n> the thinking machines may attempt.\"\n>\n> Addressing the crowd, the Viceroy summoned Xavier to the central\n> platform. \"I present for you our greatest hero, a man who stood firm\n> against the cymeks and made the *necessary* decisions to save us all.\n> Few others would have been strong enough to do the same.\"\n>\n> Feeling out of place, Xavier stepped forward to receive a military\n> medal on a striped blue, red, and gold ribbon from the Viceroy. In the\n> midst of cheers, Serena kissed him on the cheek. He hoped no one in\n> the crowd could see him blush.\n>\n> \"With this commendation comes a promotion to the rank of Tercero,\n> First Grade. Xavier Harkonnen, I charge you with studying defensive\n> tactics and installations for the entire League Armada. Your duties\n> will encompass the local Salusan Militia, along with responsibility\n> for improving the military security of the entire League of Nobles.\"\n>\n> The young officer felt awkward from the attention, but he graciously\n> accepted the accolades. \"I look forward to beginning the hard work of\n> our survival . . . and advancement.\" He favored Serena with an\n> indulgent smile. \"Following today's festivities, of course.\"\n>\n> *Dune is the planet-child of the worm.*\n\n--- from \"The Legend of Selim Wormrider,\" Zensunni Fire Poetry\n\n> **F**or an entire day and deep into the night, the monstrous sandworm\n> raced across the desert, forced beyond its normal territorial range.\n>\n> As the two moons rose and shone their curious light down upon Selim,\n> he clung to his metal staff, completely exhausted. Though he had\n> escaped being devoured by the wild and confused creature, he might\n> soon perish from the interminable ride. Buddallah had saved him, but\n> now seemed only to be toying with him.\n>\n> While thrusting the corroded spear, the youth had wedged himself into\n> a gap between worm segments, hoping he wouldn't be buried alive if the\n> demon plunged beneath the dunes. He huddled against rank flesh that\n> smelled of rotten meat impregnated with pungent cinnamon. He didn't\n> know what to do, but prayed and contemplated, searching for an\n> explanation.\n>\n> *Perhaps it is a test of some kind.*\n>\n> The sandworm continued to flee across the desert, its undersized brain\n> seemingly resigned to never again finding peace or safety. The beast\n> wanted to wallow into the dunes and hide from this malicious imp, but\n> Selim pried the spear as if it were a lever, irritating the wound\n> anew.\n>\n> The worm could only surge onward. Hour after hour.\n>\n> Selim's throat was parched, his eyes caked with grit. He must have\n> crossed half the desert already, and recognized no landforms on the\n> monotonous open bled. He had never been so far from the cave\n> community--- no one had, as far as he knew. Even if he somehow escaped\n> this giant monster, he would be doomed in the unforgiving Arrakis\n> wasteland because of his unjust sentence.\n>\n> He was certain his faithless friend Ebrahim would be exposed one day,\n> and the truth would come out; the traitor would violate other tribal\n> rules, and would eventually be recognized for the thief and liar that\n> he was. If Selim ever saw him again, he would challenge Ebrahim to a\n> fight to the death, and honor would win out.\n>\n> Perhaps the tribe would applaud him, since no one in even the grandest\n> fire poems had ever braved a giant sandworm and lived. Maybe the\n> saucy, dark-eyed young Zensunni women would look at Selim with bright\n> smiles. Dust-covered but with his head held high, he would stand\n> before stern Naib Dhartha and demand readmittance to the community. To\n> have ridden a desert demon and *lived!*\n>\n> But, though Selim had already managed to survive longer than he had\n> ever hoped, the outcome was by no means assured. What was he to do\n> now?\n>\n> Beneath him, the worm made peculiar, agitated noises, an invertebrate\n> sound beyond the loud whisper of hot sand. The weary beast shuddered,\n> and a tremor ran down its sinuous body. Selim could smell flint and an\n> overpowering aroma of spice. Friction-induced furnaces burned inside\n> the worm's gullet, like the depths of Sheol itself.\n>\n> As lemony dawn tinged the sky, the worm became more unruly and\n> desperate. It thrashed about, trying to dig itself into the sand, but\n> Selim wouldn't permit that. The monster slammed its blunt head into a\n> dune, smashing a dust spray into the air. The youth had to throw all\n> of his body weight against the spear, digging into the raw, exposed\n> worm segment.\n>\n> \"You are as sore and exhausted as I am, aren't you, Shaitan?\" he said\n> in a voice as thin and dry as paper. *Almost exhausted unto death*.\n>\n> Selim didn't dare let go. The moment he dropped off onto the barren\n> dunes, the sandworm would turn about and devour him. He had no choice\n> but to keep driving the creature. The ordeal seemed endless.\n>\n> As daylight grew brighter, he noticed a faint haze on the far horizon,\n> a distant storm with winds bearing flakes of sand and dust. But the\n>\n> disturbance was far away, and Selim had other concerns.\n>\n> At last, the demon worm ground itself to a halt not far from a ridge\n> of rocks, and refused to move. With a final convulsion, it slumped its\n> serpentine head onto a dune crest and lay like a slain dragon,\n> quivering . . . then went utterly still.\n>\n> Selim trembled with absolute weariness, fearing this was some kind of\n> final trick. The monster might be waiting for him to drop his guard so\n> it could swallow him up. Could a sandworm be devious? Was it truly\n> Shaitan?*Or did I ride it to death?*\n>\n> Gathering his energy, Selim straightened. His cramped muscles\n> trembled. He could barely move. Joints were numb; nerves prickled as\n> they awakened with the creeping fire of restored circulation. At last,\n> risking all, he yanked the metal spear from the pink flesh between the\n> callused segments.\n>\n> The worm didn't even twitch.\n>\n> Selim slid down the rounded bulk and hit the sand running. His boots\n> pumped up little dust clouds as he raced across the undulating\n> landscape. The far-off rocks were black mounds of safety protruding\n> from golden dunes.\n>\n> He refused to look behind him and ran on, gasping. Each breath was\n> like dry fire in his throat. His ears tingled, anticipating the hiss\n> of sand, the rippling approach of the vengeful creature. But the\n> sandworm remained still.\n>\n> Filled with desperate energy, Selim sprinted for half a kilometer.\n> Reaching the rock barricade, he scrambled up and finally allowed\n> himself to collapse. Drawing his knees against his chest, he sat\n> gazing out into the wash of daylight, watching the worm.\n>\n> It never moved. *Is Shaitan playing a trick? Is Buddallah testing me?*\n>\n> By now Selim was very, very hungry. He shouted at the sky, \"If you\n> have saved me for some purpose, then why not offer a bit of food?\" In\n> the extremity of his exhaustion, he began to chuckle.\n>\n> *One does not make demands of God*.\n>\n> Then he realized that there was food, of a sort. In his flight to the\n> rock sanctuary, Selim had crossed a thick ochre patch of spice, veins\n> of melange like those the Zensunni sometimes found when they ventured\n> onto the sands. They gathered the substance, using it as a food\n> additive and stimulant. Naib Dhartha kept a small stockpile within the\n> cave warrens, occasionally brewing from it a potent spice beer, which\n> the tribe members consumed on special occasions and traded at the\n> Arrakis City spaceport.\n>\n> He sat in the uncertain shade for nearly an hour, looking for any sign\n> of movement from the monster. Nothing. The day became hotter, and the\n> desert lapsed into a sluggish silence. The distant storm seemed to\n> move no closer. Selim felt as if the world itself was holding its\n> breath.\n>\n> Then, growing brash again--- after all, he had ridden Shaitan!---\n> Selim crawled down from the rocks and scurried out to the patch of\n> melange. There, he raised a wary gaze in the direction of the ominous\n> hulk.\n>\n> Standing in the rust-hued sand, he scrabbled with his hands, scooping\n> up the dry red powder. He gobbled it, spat out a few grains of sand,\n> and immediately felt the stimulant of raw spice, a large quantity to\n> take all at once. It made him dizzy, gave him an explosion of energy.\n>\n> Finally sated, he stood at a distance from the flaccid worm, hands on\n> his hips, glaring. Then he waved his arms, shouting into the utter\n> silence, \"I defeated you, Shaitan! You meant to eat me, old crawler,\n> but I conquered you instead!\" He waved his hands again. \"Can you hear\n> me?\"\n>\n> But he detected not even a flicker. Euphoric from the melange and\n> foolishly brave, he marched back toward the long sinuous body that lay\n> on the dune crest. Only a few footsteps away, he stared up into the\n> face. Its cavernous\n>\n> mouth was studded with glittering internal thorns. The long fangs\n> looked like the tiniest of hairs in relation to the creature's immense\n> size.\n>\n> Now the dust storm approached, accompanied by skirling hot breezes.\n> The wind seized grains of sand and fragments of rock, whipping them\n> against his face like tiny darts. Gusts stole around the curved\n> carcass of the worm with a whispery, hooting sound. It seemed as if\n> the ghost of the beast was *daring him*, prodding him forward. The\n> spice thrummed in Selim's bloodstream.\n>\n> Boldly, he strode to the worm's maw and peered into the black infinity\n> of its mouth. The hellish friction-fires inside were cold; not even an\n> ember remained.\n>\n> He shouted again, \"I killed you, old crawler. I am Worm Slayer.\" The\n> sandworm did not respond even to this provocation.\n>\n> He looked up at the daggerlike fangs, curved shards that lined the\n> wide, smelly mouth. Buddallah seemed to be urging him on, or maybe it\n> was simply his own desire. Moving before common sense could catch up\n> with him, Selim climbed over the lower lip of the worm and reached the\n> nearest sharp tooth.\n>\n> The young outcast grabbed it with both hands, feeling how hard it was,\n> a material even stronger than metal. He twisted and wrenched. The\n> worm's body was soft, as if the tissues of its throat were losing\n> integrity. With a suppressed grunt, Selim uprooted the fang. It was as\n> long as his forearm, curved and pure and glistening with milky\n> whiteness. It would make an excellent knife.\n>\n> He staggered back out, holding his prize, utterly terrified at the\n> realization of what he had done. An unprecedented act, as far as he\n> knew. Who else would have risked not only riding Shaitain, but\n> stepping into its maw? His body trembled to its core. He couldn't\n> believe what he had dared--- and accomplished! No other person on all\n> of Arrakis possessed a treasure such as this tooth-knife!\n>\n> Although the remaining crystalline fangs hung down like stalactites,\n> hundreds of them that he could sell in the Arrakis City spaceport (if\n> he could ever find the place again), he felt suddenly weak. The rush\n> of the melange he'd consumed was beginning to fade.\n>\n> He scrambled backward onto the soft sand. The storm was almost on top\n> of him now, reminding him of his Zensunni desert survival training. He\n> must make his way back to the rocks and find some sort of shelter, or\n> he too would soon lie dead upon the dunes, a victim of the elements.\n>\n> But he no longer thought that would happen. *I have a destiny now, a\n> mission from Buddallah . . . if only I can understand it*.\n>\n> He backed away, then turned and ran toward the line of rocks, cradling\n> the fang in his hands. The wind nudged him onward as if anxious to get\n> him away from the carcass.\n>\n> *Humans tried to develop intelligent machines as secondary reflex\n> systems, turning over primary decisions to mechanical servants.\n> Gradually, though, the creators did not leave enough to do for\n> themselves; they began to feel alienated, dehumanized, and even\n> manipulated.

Having already lived more\n> than a thousand years, the cymek general had learned to be patient.\n>\n> As patient as a machine.\n>\n> Following their secret rendezvous near the red dwarf star, he and his\n> fellow Titans reached Corrin after an interstellar voyage of nearly\n> two months. The robotic fleet had arrived days before, delivering the\n> battle images captured by the watcheyes. The evermind already knew\n> about the defeat. All that remained was for Omnius to issue rebukes\n> and reprimands, especially to Agamemnon, who had been in command.\n>\n> As he landed his ship under the blazing giant sun of Corrin, the cymek\n> general reached out with his sensor network, accepting data through\n> his thoughtrodes. Omnius would be waiting, as always, after a mission.\n>\n> Perhaps by now the evermind would have accepted the failure.\n>\n> A false hope, Agamemnon knew. The all-pervasive computer did not react\n> in the manner of a human.\n>\n> Before emerging from his ship, the Titan general chose an efficient\n> mobile body, little more than a streamlined cart that carried his\n> brain canister and life-support systems connected to the framework.\n> The cymek moved out\n>\n> onto the paved boulevards under the enormous baleful eye of the red\n> giant.\n>\n> Harsh crimson light washed the flagstoned streets and white facades.\n>\n> Millennia ago, the bloated star had expanded, growing so large that\n> its outer layers swallowed the inner planets of the system. Corrin\n> itself had once been a frozen outlying world, but the increased heat\n> from the swollen giant now made the planet habitable.\n>\n> After the atmosphere thawed and the icy seas boiled away, Corrin's\n> landscape became a blank slate on which the Old Empire established a\n> colony during its younger, ambitious days. Most of the ecosystem had\n> been transplanted from elsewhere, but even after thousands of years\n> Corrin still seemed an *unfinished* world, missing many of the\n> ecological details necessary for a thriving planet. Omnius and his\n> independent robot Erasmus liked the place because it seemed new and\n> unburdened by the baggage of history.\n>\n> Agamemnon trundled along the streets, followed by hovering watcheyes\n> that monitored him like electronic guard dogs. With surveillance\n> monitors and speakers throughout the city, the evermind could have\n> conferred with him anywhere on Corrin. Omnius, however, insisted on\n> receiving the cymek general in a lavish central pavilion built by\n> human slave labor. This pilgrimage of contrition was part of\n> Agamemnon's penance for the Salusa failure. The powerful computer\n> understood the concept of dominance.\n>\n> The electrafluid surrounding his brain churned blue as Agamemnon\n> prepared to defend himself against a rigorous interrogation. His\n> mobile body passed under tall arches supported by scrolled white-metal\n> columns. Eccentric and earnest, the robot Erasmus had copied\n> ostentatious trappings from historical records of human empires. The\n> awesome gateway was designed to make visitors tremble, though the\n> Titan doubted Omnius cared about such things.\n>\n> The cymek general halted at the center of a courtyard where fountains\n> trickled from gaps in the walls. Tame sparrows flitted about the eaves\n> and\n>\n> nested atop the pillars. Inside terra cotta urns, scarlet lilies\n> bloomed in violent explosions of petals.\n>\n> \"I have arrived, Lord Omnius,\" Agamemnon announced through his voice\n> synthesizer--- a mere formality, because he had been closely observed\n> since emerging from his ship. He waited.\n>\n> In the echoing pavilion, the mirror-faced Erasmus was nowhere to be\n> seen. Omnius wanted to upbraid his general without the curious\n> scrutiny of the independent and annoying robot. Though Erasmus fancied\n> that he understood human emotions, Agamemnon doubted the eccentric\n> machine would show even a glimmer of compassion.\n>\n> The voice boomed from a dozen speakers in the walls, like an angry\n> deity. No doubt the effect was intentional. \"You and your cymeks have\n> failed, General.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon already knew how the discussion would play out--- as did\n> Omnius. Surely the evermind himself had run simulations. Yet, this was\n> a dance that must be continued.\n>\n> \"We fought hard, but could not achieve victory, Lord Omnius. The\n> *hrethgir* put up an unexpectedly fierce defense and were surprisingly\n> willing to sacrifice their city rather than let the shield generators\n> fall. As I have said many times, feral humans are dangerously\n> unpredictable.\"\n>\n> Omnius responded without hesitation. \"You have repeatedly insisted\n> that cymeks are far superior to the human vermin, combining the best\n> advantages of machine and man. How, then, could you be rebuffed by\n> such untrained, uncivilized creatures?\"\n>\n> \"In this instance, I was in error. The humans realized our true\n> objective faster than we had anticipated.\"\n>\n> \"Your forces did not fight hard enough,\" Omnius said.\n>\n> \"Six neo-cymeks were destroyed. The gladiator body of the Titan Xerxes\n> was demolished, and he barely escaped in a launch pod.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, but the remainder of your cymeks survived. A mere twenty-one\n> percent loss does not equate with 'fighting to your fullest.'\" Around\n> the courtyard, chirping sparrows flitted about, oblivious to the\n> tension between Omnius and his top military officer. \"You should have\n> been willing to sacrifice all your cymeks to bring down the scrambler\n> shields.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon was glad he no longer displayed human expressions, which the\n> computer mind might be able to interpret. \"Lord Omnius, cymeks are\n> irreplaceable *individuals*, unlike your robotic thinking machines. In\n> my estimation, risking the loss of your most vital Titans was not a\n> reasonable exchange for one insignificant planet infested with feral\n> humans.\"\n>\n> \"Insignificant? Before the mission you emphasized the extreme\n> importance of Salusa Secundus to the League of Nobles. You claimed\n> that its fall would precipitate a complete collapse of free humanity.\n> *You* were in command.\"\n>\n> \"But is the League itself worth the obliteration of your remaining\n> Titans? We created you, established the foundation for your\n> Synchronized Worlds. The Titans should be used for more than cannon\n> fodder.\" Agamemnon was curious as to how the evermind would respond to\n> this line of reasoning. Perhaps by setting up the Titans to fall in\n> battle against feral humans, Omnius planned to bypass the choke-hold\n> of Barbarossa's protective programming.\n>\n> \"Let me ponder that,\" Omnius said. Screens on the pavilion walls\n> projected watcheye images from the battle on Zimia. \"The *hrethgir*\n> are smarter than you presumed. They saw your target. You made an error\n> in judgment thinking your cymeks would be able to push forward\n> easily.\"\n>\n> \"I miscalculated,\" Agamemnon admitted. \"The humans have a clever\n> military commander. His unexpected decisions allowed them to mount a\n> successful resistance. Now, at least, we have tested their scrambler\n> fields.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon's explanations rapidly degenerated into a succession of\n> rationalizations and excuses. Omnius analyzed and dismissed them,\n> leaving the Titan feeling bare and humiliated.\n>\n> In the serene courtyard, bright flowers bloomed and birds sang.\n> Trickling fountains added their musical sounds . . . and Agamemnon\n> contained his outrage within himself. Even his sensitive mechanical\n> body showed no sign of agitation. A thousand years ago, he and his\n> fellow Titans had controlled these damnable thinking machines. *We\n> created you, Omnius. One day, we will also destroy you.*\n>\n> While it had taken the visionary Tlaloc and his group of rebels only a\n> few years to conquer the sleepy Old Empire, Omnius and his thinking\n> machines proved to be a far superior adversary, never sleeping, always\n> watching. But even machines made mistakes. Agamemnon just needed to\n> exploit them.\n>\n> \"Is there anything else, Lord Omnius?\" he interrupted. Further\n> arguments and excuses would serve no purpose. Above all else, machines\n> craved efficiency.\n>\n> \"Only my next set of instructions, Agamemnon.\" The Omnius voice moved\n> from speaker to speaker, giving the impression that he was everywhere\n> at once. \"I am dispatching you and your Titans back to Earth. You will\n> accompany Erasmus, who intends to continue his studies of captive\n> humans there.\"\n>\n> \"As you command, Lord Omnius.\" Though surprised, Agamemnon showed no\n> reaction. *Earth* . . . a very long journey. \"We will determine other\n> ways to destroy this blight of humanity. The Titans exist only to\n> serve you.\"\n>\n> It was one of the few advantages of Agamemnon's human side: Even\n> though the evermind was filled with a vast quantity of data, Omnius\n> did not know how to recognize a simple lie.\n>\n> *From a certain perspective, defense and offense encompass nearly\n> identical tactics.*\n\n--- XAVIER HARKONNEN,\n\nraddress to Salusan Militia\n\n> **N**ew duties, new responsibilities . . . and more good-byes. As a\n> mostly recovered Xavier Harkonnen stood with Serena Butler inside the\n> Zimia Spaceport, the departure facility seemed a sterile environment\n> with echoing plaztile floors. Even the warmth of Serena's expression\n> did not compensate for the utilitarian structure. Window walls looked\n> out onto the fused pavement where shuttles took off and landed every\n> few minutes, going to and from the larger long-distance ships that\n> waited in orbit.\n>\n> In one wing of the spaceport, work crews shored up sections of a\n> hangar damaged during the cymek attack. Large cranes lifted temporary\n> walls and braces into place. Out on the landing field, huge blast\n> craters had been filled in.\n>\n> Dressed in a crisp gold-and-black Armada uniform reflecting his new\n> grade, Xavier gazed deeply into Serena's unusual lavender eyes. He\n> knew how she saw him. His facial features were not particularly\n> striking--- ruddy complexion, pointed nose, generous lips--- but\n> overall she found him attractive, especially the soft brown eyes and\n> his infectious, though rarely used, smile.\n>\n> \"I wish we could spend more time together, Xavier.\" She fingered a\n> white rose floweret on her lapel. The spaceport drone of other people,\n> noisy repair crews and heavy machinery surrounded them.\n>\n> Xavier noticed Serena's younger sister Octa watching them. A\n> seventeen-year-old with long strawberry-blond hair, she'd always had a\n> crush on Xavier. Willowy Octa was a nice enough girl, but recently he\n> wished she would give him and Serena a little more privacy, especially\n> now that they would be apart for so long.\n>\n> \"So do I. Let's make these minutes count.\" Surrendering to the urge he\n> knew they both shared, he leaned forward to kiss her, as if his lips\n> were drawn by a magnetic force. The kiss lingered, then grew intense.\n> At last Xavier pulled back. Serena looked disappointed, more with the\n> situation than with him. They both had important duties, demands on\n> their time and energy.\n>\n> Newly installed in his position, Xavier was about to embark with a\n> group of military specialists on an inspection tour of League\n> planetary defenses. After the nearly successful cymek strike against\n> Salusa two months ago, he would make certain there were no weaknesses\n> on other League Worlds. The thinking machines would exploit the\n> tiniest flaw, and free humans could not afford to lose any of their\n> remaining strongholds.\n>\n> Serena Butler, meanwhile, would focus on expanding the League domain.\n> After the battlefield surgeons had been so successful with the fresh\n> tank-grown organs provided by Tuk Keedair, Serena had spoken\n> passionately about the services and resources the Unallied Planets\n> such as Tlulaxa could provide. She wanted them to formally join the\n> union of free humans.\n>\n> Already, more flesh merchants had arrived on Salusa with their\n> biological wares; previously, many nobles and League citizens had been\n> uneasy about the mysterious outsiders, but now that the war-wounded\n> faced terrible losses of limbs and organs, they were willing to accept\n> cloned replacement parts. The Tlulaxa never explained where they had\n> developed or obtained such sophisticated biological technology, but\n> Serena praised their generosity and resources.\n>\n> At any other time, her speech in the Hall of Parliament might have\n> been forgotten, but the cymek attack had underscored her point about\n> the vulnerability of the Unallied Planets. What if the machines next\n> chose to wipe out the Thalim system and thereby eliminate the Tlulaxan\n> ability to give sight to blind veterans, new limbs to amputees?\n>\n> She had studied hundreds of survey documents and ambassadorial\n> reports, trying to determine which of the nonsignatory planets were\n> the best\n>\n> candidates for induction into the League brotherhood. Unifying the\n> remnants of humanity had become her passion, to make the free people\n> strong enough to put down any machine aggression.\n>\n> Despite her youth, she had already led two successful aid missions,\n> the first when she was only seventeen. In one she had taken food and\n> medical supplies to refugees from an abandoned Synchronized World, and\n> in the other she had provided relief for a biological blight that\n> almost destroyed the pristine farms on Poritrin.\n>\n> Neither she nor Xavier had time for themselves.\n>\n> \"When you return, I promise I will make it up to you,\" she said, her\n> eyes dancing. \"I'll give you a banquet of kisses.\"\n>\n> He allowed himself a rare laugh. \"Then I plan to arrive very hungry\n> indeed!\" Xavier took her hand and kissed it gallantly. \"When we dine\n> again, I shall come calling with flowers.\" He knew their next\n> rendezvous could be months away.\n>\n> She gave him a warm smile. \"I have a particular fondness for flowers.\"\n>\n> He was about to pull Serena close, but they were interrupted by a\n> familiar brown-skinned child coming from another direction--- Xavier's\n> eight-year-old brother, Vergyl Tantor. The boy had been permitted to\n> leave school to see him off. Breaking free of an elderly instructor\n> escort, Vergyl ran to hug his idol, nuzzling his face into the crisp\n> uniform shirt.\n>\n> \"Take care of our estate while I am gone, little brother,\" Xavier\n> said, playfully rubbing his knuckles on the boy's wiry hair. \"You are\n> in charge of tending my wolfhounds--- you understand?\"\n>\n> The boy's brown eyes widened, and he nodded gravely. \"Yes.\"\n>\n> \"And obey your parents, otherwise you can't hope to grow up to become\n> a good officer in the Armada.\"\n>\n> \"I will!\"\n>\n> An announcement summoned the inspection team to board the shuttle.\n> Hearing it, Xavier promised to bring something back for Vergyl, Octa,\n> and Serena. While Octa watched from a distance, smiling hopefully, he\n> hugged his little brother again, squeezed Serena's hand, and strode\n> off with the officers and engineers.\n>\n> Staring at the window wall where they could watch the waiting military\n> shuttle, Serena glanced down at the boy and thought of Xavier\n> Harkonnen. Xavier had been only six years old when thinking machines\n> had killed his natural parents and his older brother.\n>\n> Because of interfamily agreements and the written wills of Ulf and\n> Katarina Harkonnen, young Xavier had been raised as the foster son of\n> powerful and then-childless Emil and Lucille Tantor. The noble couple\n> had already made arrangements for their holdings to be administered by\n> Tantor relatives, distant cousins and nephews who would not normally\n> have inherited anything. But when Emil Tantor began to raise Xavier,\n> he was quite taken with the orphan and legally adopted him, though\n> Xavier retained his Harkonnen name and all associated noble rights.\n>\n> After the adoption, Lucille Tantor unexpectedly conceived a son,\n> Vergyl, who was twelve years younger than Xavier. The Harkonnen heir,\n> not worried about dynastic politics, concentrated on a course of\n> military studies, intending to join the League Armada. At the age of\n> eighteen Xavier received the legal entitlement to the original\n> Harkonnen holdings, and a year later he became an officer in the\n> Salusan Militia. With his impeccable performance and rapid promotions,\n> everyone could see Xavier was a rising star in the military ranks.\n>\n> Now three people who cared about him watched the shuttle lift into the\n> sky on a plume of orange exhaust. Vergyl held Serena's hand, bravely\n> trying to comfort her. \"Xavier will be all right. You can count on\n> him.\"\n>\n> She felt a pang for her departing love, but smiled warmly at the\n> wide-eyed boy. \"Of course we can.\"\n>\n> She would have it no other way. Love was one of the things that\n> separated humans from machines.\n>\n> *The answer is a mirror of the question.*\n\n--- COGITOR KWYNA,\n\nCity of Introspection archives\n\n> **T**he temporary meeting chamber for the League delegates had\n> originally been the home of the first Viceroy, Bovko Manresa. Before\n> the Titans had taken over the weak Old Empire, Manresa had built the\n> mansion on then-isolated Salusa Secundus as a way of celebrating\n> wealth garnered from his planetary land dealings. Later, when refugee\n> humans began arriving, driven out by the cruel rule of the Twenty\n> Titans, the big house had become a meeting hall, with chairs and a\n> lectern set up in the grand ballroom, as they were today.\n>\n> Months ago, within hours of the cymek attack, Viceroy Butler had stood\n> on a pile of rubble beneath the broken central dome of the Hall of\n> Parliament. While the poisonous dust settled in the streets and fires\n> still blazed in damaged buildings, he had vowed to repair the\n> venerable old facility that had served the League for centuries.\n>\n> The governmental edifice was more than just a building: It was\n> hallowed ground on which legendary leaders had debated great ideas and\n> formulated plans against the machines. The damage to the roof and\n> upper floors was severe, but the basic structure remained sound. Just\n> like the human spirit it represented.\n>\n> It was a frosty morning outside, with fog on the windows. Leaves on\n> the hills had begun to turn lovely autumn shades of yellow, orange,\n> and brown. Serena and the representatives came inside the temporary\n> meeting hall, still clinging to their coats.\n>\n> She gazed at the walls of the crowded old ballroom, at paintings of\n> long-dead leaders and depictions of past victories. She wondered what\n> the future would bring, and what her place might be in it. She wanted\n> so badly to *do* something, to help in the great crusade of humankind.\n>\n> Most of her life she had been an activist, always willing to get her\n> hands dirty, to assist in aiding the victims of other tragedies such\n> as natural disasters or machine attacks. Even during pleasant times,\n> she had joined the work crews of harvesters to pick grapes from the\n> Butler estate vineyards or olives from the gnarled groves.\n>\n> She took a seat in the first row, then watched as her soft-featured\n> father made his way across the wood parquet floor to the antique\n> lectern. Viceroy Butler was followed by a monk in a red-velvet tunic\n> carrying a large plexiplaz container that held a living human brain in\n> viscous electrafluid. The monk lovingly placed the container on an\n> ornate table beside the lectern, then stood beside it.\n>\n> From her front-row seat, Serena saw the pinkish gray tissue undulate\n> slightly within the pale-blue life-support liquid. Separated from the\n> senses and distractions of the physical world for more than a\n> millennium, stimulated by constant intense contemplation, the female\n> Cogitor's once-human brain had grown larger than its original size.\n>\n> \"The Cogitor Kwyna does not often leave the City of Introspection,\"\n> Viceroy Butler said, sounding both formal and excited. \"But in these\n> times we require the best thoughts and advice. If any mind can\n> understand the thinking machines, it will be Kwyna's.\"\n>\n> These esoteric disembodied philosophers were seen so infrequently that\n> many League representatives did not understand how they managed to\n> communicate. Compounding the mystery that surrounded them, Cogitors\n> rarely said much, choosing instead to marshall their energies and\n> contribute only the most important thoughts.\n>\n> \"The Cogitor's Secondary will speak for Kwyna,\" the Viceroy said, \"if\n> she has any insights to offer.\"\n>\n> Beside the brain canister, the red-robed monk removed the sealed lid,\n> exposing the agitated viscous fluid. Blinking his round eyes rapidly,\n> he stared into the tank. Slowly, the monk slid one naked hand into the\n> soup, immersing his fingers. He closed his eyes, drawing deep breaths,\n> as he\n>\n> tentatively touched the convoluted brain. His brows furrowed with\n> concentration and acceptance as the electrafluid soaked into his\n> pores, linking the Cogitor with the Secondary's neural system, using\n> him as an extension in much the same way cymeks used artificial\n> mechanical bodies.\n>\n> \"I understand nothing,\" said the monk in a strange, distant voice.\n> Serena knew that was the first principle the Cogitors adopted, and the\n> contemplative brains spent centuries in deep study, adding to that\n> sense of nothingness.\n>\n> Centuries before the original Titans, a group of spiritual humans had\n> enjoyed studying philosophy and discussing esoteric issues, but too\n> many frailties and temptations of the flesh inhibited their ability to\n> concentrate. In the ennui of the Old Empire, these metaphysical\n> scholars had been the first to have their brains installed in\n> life-support systems. Freed of biological constraints, they spent all\n> their time learning and thinking. Each Cogitor wanted to study the\n> entirety of human philosophy, bringing together the ingredients to\n> understand the universe. They lived in ivory towers and contemplated,\n> rarely bothering to note the superficial relationships and events of\n> the mundane world.\n>\n> Kwyna, the two-thousand-year-old Cogitor who resided in Salusa's City\n> of Introspection, claimed to be politically neutral. \"I am ready to\n> interact,\" she announced through the monk, who stared with glazed eyes\n> at the assembly. \"You may begin.\"\n>\n> With intense blue eyes, Viceroy Butler gazed around the packed\n> ballroom, pausing to look at a number of faces, including Serena's.\n> \"My friends, we have always lived under the threat of annihilation,\n> and now I must ask every one of you to devote your time, energies, and\n> money to our cause.\"\n>\n> He gave tribute to the tens of thousands of Salusans who had died in\n> the cymek onslaught, along with fifty-one visiting dignitaries. \"The\n> Salusan Militia remains on full alert here, and messenger ships have\n> been dispatched to all League Worlds, warning them of the danger. We\n> can only hope that no other planets were attacked.\"\n>\n> The Viceroy then called upon Tio Holtzman, recently arrived after\n> nearly a month in transit from his laboratories on Poritrin. \"Savant\n> Holtzman, we are anxious to hear your assessment of the new defenses.\"\n>\n> Holtzman had been eager to inspect his orbital scrambler fields, to\n> see how they might be modified and improved. On Poritrin, the\n> flamboyant nobleman Niko Bludd funded the Savant's research. Given his\n> past accomplishments, League members always held out the hope that\n> Holtzman would pull some other miracle out of his pocket.\n>\n> Slight of body, Holtzman moved with grace and an enormous stage\n> presence, wearing clean and stylish robes. The iron gray hair that\n> hung to his shoulders was square-cut, framing a narrow face. A man of\n> immense confidence and ego, he loved to speak to important dignitaries\n> in the Parliament, but now he appeared uncharacteristically troubled.\n> In truth, the inventor could not bring himself to admit a mistake.\n> Unquestionably, his scrambler network had failed. The cymeks had\n> broken through! What would he say to these people who had relied on\n> him?\n>\n> Reaching the speaking platform, the great man cleared his throat and\n> looked around, glancing oddly at the imposing presence of the Cogitor\n> and the looming attendant monk. This was a most delicate matter. How\n> could he shift the blame from himself?\n>\n> The scientist used his best voice. \"In warfare, whenever one side\n> makes a technological breakthrough, the other attempts to top it. We\n> recently witnessed this with my atmospheric scrambler fields. Had they\n> not been installed here, the full thinking machine fleet would have\n> laid waste to Salusa. Unfortunately, I did not factor in the unique\n> abilities of the cymeks. They found a chink in the armor and\n> penetrated it.\"\n>\n> No one had accused him of lax work or poor planning, but this was the\n> closest Holtzman would come to admitting that he had overlooked a\n> major flaw. \"Now it is our turn to surpass the machines with a new\n> concept. I hope to be inspired by this tragedy, pushing my creativity\n> to its limits.\" He then\n>\n> stalled and looked embarrassed, even endearing. \"I'll be working on\n> that, as soon as I get back to Poritrin. I hope to have a surprise for\n> you very soon.\"\n>\n> A tall, statuesque woman glided toward the lectern, drawing attention\n> to herself. \"Perhaps I have a suggestion.\" She had pale eyebrows,\n> white hair, and luminous skin that made her seem ethereal, but charged\n> with power.\n>\n> \"Let us hear from the women of Rossak. I gladly yield to Zufa Cenva.\"\n> Looking relieved, Holtzman hurried back to his seat and slumped into\n> it.\n>\n> The pale woman carried an air of mystery about her; she wore glowing\n> jewelry on a black, diaphanous gown that revealed much of her perfect\n> body. Pausing at the Cogitor's life-support case, Zufa Cenva peered\n> inside at the enlarged brain. Her brow furrowed as she concentrated,\n> and as she did so, the brain itself seemed to vibrate; the\n> electrafluid swirled, bubbles formed. Alarmed, the devout attendant\n> monk withdrew his hand from the liquid.\n>\n> The tall woman relaxed, satisfied, and stepped to the podium. \"Because\n> of oddities in our environment, many of the females born on Rossak\n> exhibit enhanced telepathic abilities.\" Indeed, the powerful\n> Sorceresses of the dense, barely habitable jungles had parlayed their\n> mental quirks into political influence. Rossak men exhibited no such\n> telepathic enhancements.\n>\n> \"The League of Nobles was formed a thousand years ago for our mutual\n> defense, first against the Titans and then against Omnius. Since then,\n> we have barricaded ourselves, trying to protect our worlds from the\n> enemy.\" Her eyes flashed like highly polished stones. \"We need to\n> rethink this strategy. Perhaps it is time for *us* to take the\n> offensive against the Synchronized Worlds.

Although Zufa was\n> known to have extrasensory powers, she had never before displayed them\n> in Parliament. Her milky pale skin seemed to heat up with an inner\n> light. The air in the enclosed chamber stirred, and static electricity\n> crackled around the assemblage, making hair stand on end.\n>\n> Lightning flickered at her fingertips, as if she were holding a barely\n> contained thunderstorm inside herself. Her own white hair coiled and\n> writhed like snakes. When Zufa's eyes opened again, a dazzling energy\n> seemed ready to shoot out of them, as if the universe lived behind her\n> pupils.\n>\n> Gasps echoed through the delegates. Serena's skin crawled and her\n> scalp tingled, as if a thousand poisonous spiders skittered over her\n> mind. In her preservation tank, the Cogitor Kwyna churned.\n>\n> Then Zufa relaxed, throttling back the chain reaction of mental\n> energy. Letting out a long, cold breath, the Sorceress smiled grimly\n> at the startled onlookers. \"*We* have a weapon.\"\n>\n> *The eyes of common perception do not see far. Too often we make the\n> most important decisions based only on superficial information.*\n>\n> --- NORMA CENVA,\n\nunpublished laboratory notebooks\n\n> **A**fter delivering her announcement to the League assembly, Zufa\n> Cenva returned to Rossak. She had been in transit for weeks, and her\n> shuttle now landed on a dense section of the jungle canopy that had\n> been paved over with a polymer to seal and fuse the branches and\n> leaves into a solid mass. To enable the trees to receive adequate\n> moisture and gas exchange, the polymer was porous, synthesized from\n> jungle chemicals and organics.\n>\n> Toxic oceans made the native Rossak planktons, fish, kelp, and sea\n> creatures poisonous to humans. Rugged, sterile lava plains covered\n> much of the planet's land area, dotted with geysers and brimstone\n> lakes. Since the botanical chemistry did not rely on chlorophyll, the\n> general cast of all plants was silvery purple; nothing here was fresh\n> and green.\n>\n> In a tectonically stable zone girdling the equator, large rifts in the\n> continental plate created broad sanctuary valleys where the water was\n> filtered and the air breathable. In these protected rift ecosystems,\n> hardy human settlers had constructed sophisticated cave-cities like\n> hives tunneled into the black cliffs. The declivitous external walls\n> were overgrown with silvery-purple vines, drooping ferns, and fleshy\n> moss. Comfortable chambers looked out upon a thick jungle canopy that\n> pressed against the settlement cliffs. People could venture directly\n> onto the upper rubbery branches and descend to the dense underbrush,\n> where they harvested edibles.\n>\n> As if to make up for the dearth of life elsewhere on Rossak, the rift\n> valleys teemed with aggressive living things--- mushrooms, lichens,\n> berries, flowers, orchidlike parasites, and insects. The Rossak men,\n> lacking the telepathic enhancement of their women, had turned their\n> talents to developing and extracting drugs, pharmaceuticals, and\n> occasional poisons\n>\n> from nature's larder. The entire place was like a Pandora's box that\n> had been opened only a crack. . . .\n>\n> Now the tall, luminous Sorceress watched as her much younger paramour,\n> Aurelius Venport, crossed a suspended bridge from the open cliffs to\n> the foamy purple treetops. His patrician features were handsome, his\n> dark hair curly, his face long and lean. Tagging along behind him on\n> stubby legs came Zufa's disappointing fifteen-year-old daughter by a\n> prior relationship.\n>\n> *Two misfits. No wonder they get along so well*.\n>\n> Prior to seducing Aurelius Venport, the chief Sorceress had arranged\n> conjugal relationships with four other men during her peak breeding\n> times, selecting them for their proven bloodlines. After generations\n> of research, miserable miscarriages, and defective offspring, the\n> women of Rossak had compiled detailed genetic indices of various\n> families. Because of heavy environmental toxins and teratogens, the\n> odds were against any child being born strong and healthy. But for\n> every stillborn monster or talentless male, a miraculous pale-skinned\n> Sorceress might occur. Each time a woman conceived a child, it was\n> like playing a game of roulette. Genetics was never an exact science.\n>\n> But Zufa had been so careful, checking and double-checking the\n> bloodlines. Only one of those conjugal encounters had resulted in a\n> living child--- Norma, a dwarf barely four feet tall, with blocky\n> features, mousy brown hair, and a tedious, bookish personality.\n>\n> Many offspring on Rossak had defective bodies, and even the apparently\n> healthy ones rarely exhibited the strong mental powers of the elite\n> Sorceresses. Nevertheless, Zufa felt deep disappointment, even\n> embarrassment, that *her* daughter had no telepathic skills. The\n> greatest living Sorceress should have been able to pass along her\n> superior mental abilities, and she desperately wanted her daughter to\n> carry on the fight against the machines. But Norma showed no potential\n> whatsoever. And despite Aurelius Venport's impeccable genetic\n> credentials, Zufa had never been able to carry one of his babies to\n> term.\n>\n> *How many more times must I keep trying before I replace him with\n> another breeder?* Once more, she decided--- she would attempt to get\n> pregnant again, within the next few months. It would be Venport's last\n> chance.\n>\n> Zufa was also disappointed in Norma's independence and defiance. Too\n> often the teenager spun off on obscure mathematical tangents that no\n> one could comprehend. Norma seemed lost in her own world.\n>\n> *My daughter, you should have been so much more!*\n>\n> No one had a heavier burden of responsibility than the small clan of\n> Sorceresses on the planet, and Zufa's burden was the greatest of all.\n> If only she could count on everyone else, especially in light of this\n> latest danger from the cymeks.\n>\n> Since stunted Norma could never take part in the mental battle, Zufa\n> had to concentrate on her daughters in spirit, those few young women\n> who had won the \"genetic lottery\" and acquired superior mental\n> abilities. Zufa would train and encourage them, showing them how to\n> eradicate the enemy.\n>\n> From her cliffside perch, she watched her lover Aurelius and young\n> Norma reach the other side of the suspension bridge and begin to\n> negotiate a circular network of ladders that led to the deeply\n> shadowed jungle floor. Like two happy-go-lucky outcasts, Norma and\n> Aurelius had grown close emotionally, using one another as crutches.\n>\n> Engrossed in their own petty concerns that had nothing to do with\n> victory, neither of them had even noticed Zufa's return on the\n> shuttle. No doubt the two misfits would spend hours poking through the\n> foliage in search of new drug resources, which Aurelius would\n> incorporate into his business ventures.\n>\n> The Sorceress shook her head, not understanding his priorities. Those\n> drugs the men developed were of little more use than Norma's arcane\n> mathematics. Admittedly, Aurelius was a highly intelligent and skilled\n> businessman, but what good were enormous profits if free humanity was\n> doomed to enslavement?\n>\n> Disappointed in both of them, knowing that she and her Sorceresses\n> would have to do the real fighting, Zufa set out to find the most\n> powerful young women she had recruited to learn the devastating new\n> technique she planned to unleash against the cymeks.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AS NORMA FOLLOWED him through the fleshy underbrush, Aurelius consumed\n> capsules of a focused stimulant that his expert chemists had\n> synthesized from the pungent pheromones of a boulder-sized burrowing\n> beetle. Venport felt stronger, his perceptions sharpened, his reflexes\n> enhanced. Not quite like the telepathic powers of icy Zufa, but better\n> than his natural abilities.\n>\n> Someday he would make a breakthrough, allowing him to meet the\n> powerful Sorceress on his own terms. Maybe he and Norma would do it\n> together.\n>\n> Aurelius maintained a benign fondness for the girl's stern mother. He\n> tolerated Zufa's moods and scornful attitude with good grace; Rossak\n> women rarely allowed themselves the luxury of romantic love.\n>\n> Though Aurelius knew full well that Zufa had selected him for his\n> breeding potential, he saw through the woman's stoic, demanding\n> exterior. Attempting to conceal her weaknesses, the powerful Sorceress\n> showed her doubts on occasion, afraid that she could not fulfill the\n> responsibilities she had placed on herself. Once, when Aurelius\n> commented that he knew how strong she was trying to be, Zufa had grown\n> embarrassed and angry. \"Somebody has to be strong\" was all she had\n> said.\n>\n> Since he lacked telepathic ability, Zufa had little interest in\n> engaging him in conversation. Perhaps she recognized his skills as a\n> businessman, investor, and politician, but she valued none of those\n> abilities as much as her own narrow goals. The Sorceress frequently\n> tried to make him feel like a failure, but her derision only served to\n> ignite his ambition, especially his desire to find a drug that would\n> give him telepathic powers equivalent to her own.\n>\n> There were other ways to fight a war.\n>\n> The silvery-purple jungles offered a treasure-trove to cure diseases,\n> expand the mind, and improve human abilities. The choices were\n> overwhelming, but Aurelius sought to investigate everything. From\n> proper development and marketing, the products of Rossak had already\n> put him on the path to great wealth. He was even grudgingly respected\n> by a number of the Sorceresses--- except by his own mate.\n>\n> As a visionary entrepreneur, he was accustomed to exploring\n> alternatives. Like paths through a dense jungle, many routes could\n> lead to the same place. Sometimes, one just had to hack through with a\n> machete.\n>\n> So far, though, the right drug eluded him.\n>\n> In another venture, he had proudly distributed Norma's exotic\n> mathematical work among scholarly scientific circles. Though he didn't\n> understand her theorems, he had a gut feeling that she might come up\n> with something important. Maybe she had already done so, and it took\n> expert eyes to recognize it. Venport liked the intense girl, acting as\n> a big brother to her. As far as he was concerned, Norma was a\n> mathematical prodigy, so who cared about her height or her appearance?\n> He was willing to give her a chance, even if her mother never would.\n>\n> Beside him, Norma studied the design of a broad purple leaf, using a\n> light-beam caliper to measure its various dimensions and the\n> relationships among angles in the sap-filled veins. The depth of her\n> concentration added a wistful cast to her plain features.\n>\n> Glancing back at him, Norma said in a surprisingly mature voice, \"This\n> leaf has been designed and constructed by the Earth mother Gaia, or\n> the Master Creator God, or Buddallah, or whatever you want to call\n> it.\" With blunt fingers, she held up the fleshy leaf and passed a beam\n> of light through it, so that the intricate cellular designs showed\n> clearly. \"Patterns within patterns, all tied together in complex\n> relationships.\"\n>\n> In his drug-enhanced, euphoric state, Aurelius found the design\n> hypnotic. \"God is in everything,\" he said. The stimulant he had taken\n> seemed to supercharge his synapses. He squinted through the\n> illuminated fabric of the leaf as she pointed to the internal shapes.\n>\n> \"God is the mathematician of the universe. There is an ancient\n> correlation known as the Golden Mean, a pleasing ratio of form and\n> structure that is found in this leaf, in seashells, and in the living\n> creatures of many planets. It is the tiniest part of the key, known\n> since the time of the Greeks and Egyptians of Earth. They used it in\n> their architecture and pyramids, in their Pythagorean pentagram and\n> Fibonacci sequence.\" She discarded the leaf. \"But there is so much\n> more.\"\n>\n> Nodding, Venport touched a moistened fingertip to a pouch of fine\n> black powder at his belt; he rubbed the powder under the sensitive\n> tissue of his tongue and felt another drug penetrating his senses,\n> merging with the remnants of the last one. Norma kept talking; though\n> he did not follow her logical development, he was certain the\n> revelations must be fabulous.\n>\n> \"Give me a practical example,\" he slurred. \"Something with a function\n> that I can understand.\"\n>\n> He had grown accustomed to Norma spouting off obscure formulations.\n> Her basis might have been in classical geometry, but she applied her\n> knowledge in much more complex ways. \"I can envision calculations all\n> the way to infinity,\" she said, as if in a trance. \"I don't have to\n> write them down.\"\n>\n> *And she doesn't even need mind-enhancement drugs to accomplish it,*\n> Aurelius marveled.\n>\n> \"At this very moment I envision a huge and efficient structure that\n> could be built at a reasonable cost, tens of kilometers long--- and\n> based upon the ratio of the Golden Mean.\"\n>\n> \"But who would ever need something so immense?\"\n>\n> \"I cannot peer into the future, Aurelius.\" Norma teased him. Then they\n> trudged deeper into the weird jungle, still curious and intent on what\n> they might discover. Norma's face was radiant with energy. \"But there\n> might be something . . . something I haven't thought of yet.\"\n>\n> *Careful preparations and defenses can never guarantee* *victory.*\n>\n> *However, ignoring these precautions is an almost certain recipe for\n> defeat.*\n>\n> ---*League Armada Strategy Manual*\n>\n> **F**or four months, Tercero Xavier Harkonnen and his six Armada\n> survey vessels traveled along a predetermined route, stopping to\n> inspect and assess the military facilities and defensive preparations\n> of the League Worlds. After many years of no more than a few\n> skirmishes, no one knew where Omnius might strike next.\n>\n> Xavier had never wavered from the difficult decision he'd made during\n> the cymek attack on Zimia. The Viceroy had praised him for his nerve\n> and determination; even so, Manion Butler had wisely sent the young\n> officer away during the major rebuilding activities, giving Salusans\n> time to heal their wounds without looking for a scapegoat.\n>\n> Xavier listened to no excuses from tightwad nobles unwilling to commit\n> the necessary resources. No expense must be spared. Any free world\n> that fell to machine aggression would be a loss for the entire human\n> race.\n>\n> The survey ships traveled from the mines of Hagal to the broad river\n> plains of Poritrin, then made their way to Seneca where the weather\n> was poor and the rain so corrosive that even thinking machines would\n> break down soon after a conquest.\n>\n> The League planets of Relicon followed, then Kirana III, then Richese,\n> with its burgeoning high-tech industries that made so many other\n> League noblemen uneasy. In theory, the sophisticated manufacturing\n> devices contained no computerization or artificial intelligence, but\n> there were always questions, always doubts.\n>\n> Finally Xavier's team arrived at their final inspection stop, Giedi\n> Prime. At last, his tour was about to end. He could return home, see\n> Serena again, and they could make good on their promises to each\n> other. . . .\n>\n> All other League Worlds had installed scrambler field towers. The\n> shields' known weakness against cymeks did not completely devalue\n> Holtzman's ingenious work, and the costly barriers still provided\n> substantial protection against all-out thinking machine offensives. In\n> addition, every human world had long ago built up enormous stockpiles\n> of atomics as part of a doomsday defense. With so many nuclear\n> warheads, an iron-willed planetary governor could turn his world into\n> slag rather than allowing it to fall to Omnius.\n>\n> Although the thinking machines also had access to atomics, Omnius had\n> concluded that atomics were an inefficient and nonselective way to\n> impose control, and radioactive cleanup afterward was difficult.\n> Besides, with unlimited resources and a deep reservoir of patience,\n> the relentless evermind had no need of such weapons.\n>\n> Now, as Xavier disembarked from the lead survey ship at the Giedi City\n> spaceport, he blinked under bright sunlight. The well-maintained\n> metropolis sprawled in front of him, with its habitation complexes and\n> productive industrial buildings amid manicured parks and canals. The\n> colors were bright and fresh, and flowers bloomed in ornate beds,\n> although with his new Tlulaxa lungs and tissues he could smell only a\n> hint of the most potent scents, even when he breathed deeply.\n>\n> \"This would be a fine place to bring Serena one day,\" he said\n> wistfully as he stood in the heat-shimmer of spaceship exhaust. If he\n> married her, perhaps this would be a suitable world for their\n> honeymoon. During the current inspection tour, he had kept his eyes\n> open, trying to find a likely spot.\n>\n> After four months in space, Xavier missed Serena terribly. He knew the\n> two of them were destined for each other. His life operated on a\n> smooth, clearly defined path. When he returned to Salusa, he promised\n> himself that he would formalize their betrothal. He saw no point in\n> waiting any longer.\n>\n> Viceroy Butler already treated him like a son, and the young officer\n> had received the blessing of his adoptive father Emil Tantor. As far\n> as Xavier\n>\n> could determine, everyone in the League agreed it would be a fine\n> joining of noble houses.\n>\n> He smiled, thinking of Serena's face, of her intriguing lavender eyes\n> . . . and then looked across the landing field to see Magnus Sumi\n> approaching the survey ships. The elected leader was accompanied by a\n> dozen members of the Giedi Prime Home Guard.\n>\n> The Magnus was a thin man in late middle age with pale skin and\n> gray-blond hair that hung to his shoulders. Sumi raised a hand. \"Ah,\n> Tercero Harkonnen! We welcome the League Armada and are eager to see\n> how Giedi Prime can improve its defenses against the thinking\n> machines.\"\n>\n> Xavier snapped a stiff bow in return. \"Your cooperation pleases me,\n> Eminence. Against Omnius, we must not use low-cost materials or\n> stopgap systems that would not adequately protect your people.\"\n>\n> After the Battle of Zimia, Xavier's corps of engineers had made\n> requests for mandatory strategic improvements throughout the League.\n> The nobles dug into their coffers, increasing taxes on their subjects\n> and spending the necessary money to build up their defenses. At each\n> stop, planet after planet, month after month, Xavier had assigned\n> teams of engineers and Armada troops where he deemed they were most\n> needed.\n>\n> Soon, though, he would be going back home. *Soon*. As the time drew\n> near, he thought of Serena more and more.\n>\n> Well dressed and well armed, the Home Guard stood at attention around\n> the survey ships. Magnus Sumi gestured for Xavier to follow him. \"I\n> look forward to clarifying everything over a sumptuous banquet,\n> Tercero Harkonnen. I've set up twelve fine courses with dancers,\n> musicians, and our best poets. You and I can relax in my government\n> residence while we discuss plans. I am certain you must be weary from\n> your journey. How long can you stay with us?\"\n>\n> Xavier could form only a tight smile, thinking of how far away he was\n> from Salusa Secundus. Even after leaving Giedi Prime, the ships would\n> still need\n>\n> another month of fast space travel to return home. The sooner he\n> departed here, the sooner he could hold Serena in his arms again.\n>\n> \"Eminence, this is the final stop on our long tour. If it pleases you,\n> I would prefer to spend less time with festivities and more on the\n> inspection.\" He gestured toward his survey ship. \"We have a schedule\n> to keep. I'm afraid I can allot only two days for Giedi Prime. It is\n> best that we concentrate on our work.\"\n>\n> The Magnus looked crestfallen. \"Yes, I suppose celebration is not\n> appropriate after the damage done to Salusa Secundus.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> FOR TWO DAYS, Xavier gave the planetary defenses a quick, almost\n> cursory inspection. He found Giedi Prime to be a dazzling and\n> prosperous world with many resources, perhaps even a suitable place to\n> settle down and start an estate of his own one day.\n>\n> He gave a favorable assessment, accompanied by a warning. \"This is\n> undoubtedly a planet the thinking machines will want to conquer,\n> Eminence.\" He studied the city blueprints and the distribution of\n> resources across the main continents. \"Any cymek attack would most\n> likely attempt to keep the industries intact so that robots could\n> exploit them. Omnius preaches efficiency.\"\n>\n> Beside him, Magnus Sumi reacted with pride. He pointed out substations\n> on the diagrams. \"We intend to install secondary field-transmitting\n> towers at several strategic points.\" As he spoke, highlights appeared\n> on the blueprint screen. \"We have already built a completely redundant\n> transmitting station on one of the uninhabited islands in the northern\n> sea, which can provide full overlap from a polar projection. We hope\n> to have it online within another month.\"\n>\n> Xavier nodded distractedly, his mind weary from months of such\n> details. \"I am glad to hear that, though I doubt a second transmitting\n> complex is entirely necessary.\"\n>\n> \"We want to feel safe, Tercero.\"\n>\n> When the two men stood under silvery parabolic towers that throbbed\n> into the sky over Giedi City, Xavier paced around the plascrete\n> embankments that blocked access to large vehicles. He had no doubt a\n> cymek warrior could easily crash through.\n>\n> \"Eminence, I suggest you station more ground troops and obstacles\n> here. Increase your planetside missile-defense batteries to protect\n> against any intrusion from space. On Salusa, the cymek strategy was to\n> focus their entire attack on the destruction of the towers, and they\n> might try that again.\" He rapped his knuckles against the tower's\n> heavy paristeel support pillar. \"These shields are your first and last\n> line of defense, your most effective blockade against thinking\n> machines. Do not neglect them.\"\n>\n> \"Indeed. Our munitions factories are building heavy artillery and\n> armored ground vehicles. As soon as possible, we intend to surround\n> this complex with a large concentration of military power.\"\n>\n> As for the uncompleted secondary generating station, it was too\n> isolated to be protected from a massive assault. But its existence\n> seemed to comfort the Magnus and his populace.\n>\n> \"Very good,\" Xavier said, then glanced at the chronometer on his\n> wrist. Everything was going so well, perhaps his survey ships could\n> depart before sunset. . . .\n>\n> The Magnus continued, his voice uncertain, \"Tercero, are you concerned\n> about Giedi Prime's limited space military defenses? Our Home Guard\n> has few large ships in orbit to drive back an approaching machine\n> fleet, and our picket ships and scouts are minimal. I admit to feeling\n> vulnerable in that area. What if Omnius attacks us directly from\n> orbit?\"\n>\n> \"You have ground-based missile defenses in place, and they have always\n> proved reliable.\" Impatient, Xavier looked up into the clear sky. \"I\n> believe your best hope is to protect your shield complex here on the\n> ground. No quantity of Armada battleships can match the deterrent\n> power of scrambler\n>\n> shields. When the robot fleet attacking Salusa realized they could not\n> take down the scramblers, they retreated.\"\n>\n> \"But what if they blockade Giedi Prime from orbit?\"\n>\n> \"Your world is self-sufficient enough to wait out any siege until the\n> arrival of a League rescue force.\" Anxious to be back at the\n> spaceport, Xavier decided to appease the governor. \"Nevertheless, I\n> will recommend that a javelin-class destroyer or two be stationed\n> around Giedi Prime.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THAT EVENING, THE Magnus threw a departure banquet for the Armada\n> service performed on his behalf. \"Someday,\" he said, \"we may all thank\n> you for our lives.\"\n>\n> Xavier excused himself midway through the meal. The food and wine\n> seemed to lack taste. \"My apologies, Eminence, but my squadron must\n> not miss the optimal departure window.\" He bowed at the doorway, then\n> hurried to his vessel. Some of his troops would have liked to remain\n> longer, but most were also eager to get home. They had their own\n> sweethearts and families, and these soldiers had more than earned\n> furloughs.\n>\n> With his inspection tour behind him, Xavier left lovely Giedi Prime,\n> confident that he had seen and done everything necessary.\n>\n> And completely unaware of the vulnerabilities he had not bothered to\n> discover. . . .\n>\n> *In the process of becoming slaves to machines, we transferred\n> technical knowledge to them--- without imparting proper value\n> systems.*\n\n--- PRIMERO FAYKAN BUTLER,\n\n*Memoirs of the Jihad*\n\n> **T**he *Dream Voyager* neared Earth, humanity's original home and now\n> the central Synchronized World.

You are one step closer to meeting our goals.\" He\n> swiveled his turret around, reversing the direction of progress, and\n> Vorian trotted beside the armored legs as Agamemnon strode away from\n> the ship.\n>\n> \"If only my fragile body survives long enough to accomplish\n> everything,\" Vor said wistfully. \"I can't wait to be selected as a\n> neo-cymek.\"\n>\n> \"You are only twenty, Vorian. Too young to be morbidly concerned about\n> your mortality.\"\n>\n> Overhead, resource haulers dropped from orbit, balanced atop\n> yellow-white flames that slowed their descent. Loadcars manned by\n> human workers trundled up to where ships had landed, preparing to\n> distribute cargoes according to rigid instructions. Vor glanced at the\n> slaves but did not ponder their situation. Each person had his own\n> duties, every human and machine a cog in the Synchronized Worlds. But\n> Vor was superior to the others, since he had a chance to become like\n> his father one day. A cymek.\n>\n> They passed unmarked warehouses with computerized monitoring and\n> inventory systems where fuel and supplies were stored. Human clerical\n> personnel dispersed food and materials from storehouses to slaves\n> inside the city. Inspectors--- some robotic, some human--- performed\n> quality control and quantity assessments for the larger-scale plans of\n> Omnius.\n>\n> Vor could not comprehend the lives of the uneducated workers who\n> unloaded heavy crates at the space dock. The slave laborers performed\n> duties that a simple loading machine could have done faster and more\n> efficiently. But he was pleased that even these lesser people had\n> tasks they could perform in order to earn their subsistence.\n>\n> \"Seurat told me about Salusa Secundus, Father.\" He maintained a quick\n> pace to match the cymek's huge strides. \"I'm sorry your assault was\n> unsuccessful.\"\n>\n> \"Just a test case,\" Agamemnon said. \"The feral humans have a new\n> defensive system, and now we have probed it.\"\n>\n> Vor beamed. \"I'm sure you'll discover a way to bring all *hrethgir*\n> under the efficient rule of Omnius. Like the times described in your\n> memoirs, when Titans were in complete control.\"\n>\n> Inwardly, the cymek general frowned at the comments. Agamemnon's optic\n> threads detected numerous watcheyes floating around them as the two\n> walked. \"I do not wish for the old days, of course,\" he said,\n> presently. \"You have been reading my memoirs again?\"\n>\n> \"I never tire of your stories, Father. The Time of Titans, the great\n> Tlaloc, the First Hrethgir Rebellions . . . everything is so\n> fascinating.\" Accompanying the magnificent cymek made Vor feel\n> special. He always remained alert, within the limitations of his\n> position, for ways to better himself. He wanted to prove himself\n> worthy of the opportunities he'd been given . . . and of more. \"I\n> would be happy to learn of this new *hrethgir* defensive system,\n> Father. Perhaps I can assist you in finding a way to defeat it?\"\n>\n> \"Omnius is analyzing the data and will decide what to do. I have only\n> recently arrived back on Earth.\"\n>\n> With human ambitions still a fundamental part of their psyches, the\n> Titans always had monumental construction projects under way:\n> megalithic buildings and monuments to themselves that celebrated the\n> lost age of humanity and glorified the Time of Titans. Captive human\n> artists and\n>\n> architects were ordered to develop original designs and sketches that\n> the cymeks modified or approved.\n>\n> Nearby, machinery lifted the components of skyscraper buildings into\n> place, adding upper floors to existing complexes, though the thinking\n> machines had little need for further expansion. At times, the\n> extravagant construction seemed to Vor like mere busy-work for the\n> slaves. . . .\n>\n> He had never known his mother, and understood only that ages ago,\n> before the Titans had surgically converted themselves into cymeks,\n> Agamemnon had created his own sperm bank, from which he had germinated\n> Vorian. Over the centuries, the general could create any number of\n> offspring using acceptable surrogate mothers.\n>\n> Though he had never learned about any siblings, Vorian suspected they\n> were out there somewhere. He wondered what it would be like to meet\n> them, but in machine society, emotional attachments were not\n> practical. He only hoped that his siblings had not proven to be\n> disappointments to Agamemnon.\n>\n> When his father was off on his frequent missions, Vor often tried to\n> talk with the remaining Titans, curious about the events recorded in\n> Agamemnon's celebrated and voluminous memoirs. He used his responsible\n> position to better himself. Some of the original cymeks--- especially\n> Ajax--- were arrogant and treated Vor as a nuisance. Others, like Juno\n> or Barbarossa, found him amusing. All of them spoke with utmost\n> passion about Tlaloc, the first of the great Titans, who had sparked\n> the revolution.\n>\n> \"I wish I'd been able to meet Tlaloc,\" Vor said, trying to keep the\n> conversation going. Agamemnon loved to speak of his glory days.\n>\n> \"Yes, Tlaloc was a dreamer with ideas I had never heard before,\" the\n> cymek mused as he strode down the boulevards. \"At times he was a bit\n> na\u00efve, not always understanding the practical repercussions of his\n> ideas. But I pointed them out to him. That was why we made such a\n> great team.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon seemed to pick up speed when he spoke of the Titans. Weary\n> from trying to keep up the rapid pace, Vorian gasped for breath.\n>\n> \"Tlaloc took his name from an ancient rain god. Among the Titans,\n> Tlaloc was our visionary, while I was the military commander. Juno was\n> our tactician and manipulator. Dante watched over statistics,\n> bureaucracy, and population-accounting. Barbarossa saw to the\n> reprogramming of the thinking machines, making certain they had the\n> same goals as we did. He gave them ambition.\"\n>\n> \"And a good thing, too,\" Vorian said.\n>\n> Agamemnon hesitated, but did not voice any objections, wary of the\n> watcheyes. \"When he visited Earth, Tlaloc realized how the human race\n> had gone stagnant, how people had become so dependent on machines that\n> they had nothing left but apathy. Their goals were gone, their drive,\n> their passion. When they should have had nothing to do but unleash\n> their creative impulses, they were too lazy to perform even the work\n> of the imagination.\" His vocal speakers made a disgusted sound.\n>\n> \"But Tlaloc was different,\" Vor said, on cue.\n>\n> The cymek's voice took on more emotion. \"Tlaloc grew up in the Thalim\n> system, on an outer colony world where life was difficult, where labor\n> was not accomplished without sweat, blood, and blisters. He had to\n> fight his way and earn his position. On Earth, he saw that the human\n> spirit had all but died---*and the people hadn't even noticed!*\n>\n> \"He gave speeches attempting to rally the humans, to make them see\n> what was happening. A few watched him with interest, considering him a\n> novelty.\" Agamemnon raised one of his powerful metal arms. \"But they\n> heard his words only as a diversion. Soon the bored audiences returned\n> to their slothful, hedonistic pursuits.\"\n>\n> \"But not you, Father.\"\n>\n> \"I was dissatisfied with my uneventful life. I had already met Juno,\n> and the two of us had dreams. Tlaloc crystallized them for us. After\n> Juno and I joined him, we set in motion the events that led to the\n> downfall of the Old Empire.\"\n>\n> Father and son arrived at the central complex where the Earth-Omnius\n> resided, although redundant nodes of the evermind were distributed\n> around the planet in a network of armored vaults and high towers.\n> Vorian followed the cymek into the main structure, eager to do his\n> part. This was a ritual they had completed many times.\n>\n> The walker body strode through wide halls and entered a maintenance\n> facility filled with lubricant tubes, bubbling nutrient cylinders,\n> polished tabletops, and flickering analysis systems. Vor retrieved a\n> tool kit, then turned on vacuum hoses and high-pressure water jets,\n> found soft rags and polishing lotions. He considered it his most\n> important task as a trustee.\n>\n> In the center of the sterile room, Agamemnon halted beneath a lifting\n> apparatus. A magnetic claw-hand came down and attached itself to the\n> preservation canister that held his ancient brain. Neural connection\n> ports popped open, and thoughtrode cables spiraled away. The lifting\n> arm raised the canister, still attached to temporary batteries and\n> life-support systems.\n>\n> Vorian came forward with an armload of equipment. \"I know you can't\n> feel this, Father, but I like to think it makes you more comfortable\n> and efficient.\" He blasted the connection ports with high-pressure air\n> and streams of warm water, using a wadded cloth to polish every\n> surface. The cymek general transmitted wordless gratified murmurings.\n>\n> Vor completed the cleaning and polishing, then adjusted wires and\n> cables and hooked up diagnostics. \"All functions optimal, Father.\"\n>\n> \"With your attentive maintenance, it is no wonder. Thank you, my son.\n> You take such good care of me.\"\n>\n> \"It is my honor to do so.\"\n>\n> His synthesized voice purring, Agamemnon said, \"One day, Vorian, if\n> you continue serving me so well, I will recommend you for the greatest\n> reward. I will ask Omnius to surgically convert you into a cymek, like\n> me.\"\n>\n> At the mention of this wonderful prospect, Vorian again polished the\n> canister, then looked lovingly at the creamy contours of the brain\n> inside. He tried to hide his flush of eager embarrassment, but tears\n> came to his eyes. \"That is the best a human can hope for.\"\n>\n> *Humans, with such fragile physical forms, are easily crushed. Is it\n> any challenge to hurt or damage them?*\n\n--- ERASMUS,\n\nuncollated laboratory files\n\n> **G**azing out upon the skies of Earth again through hundreds of\n> appraising optic threads, Erasmus was not pleased. The robot stood in\n> a high bell tower of his villa, staring through a curving expanse of\n> armored windowplate. The landscape of this world, with its oceans and\n> forests and cities built upon the bones of other cities had already\n> seen countless civilizations rise and fall. The scope of history made\n> his own accomplishments seem small and contrived.\n>\n> Therefore, he would have to try harder.\n>\n> Neither Omnius nor any of his delegated architect robots understood\n> true beauty. To Erasmus, the buildings and the layout of the rebuilt\n> city resembled components with sharp angles, abrupt discontinuities. A\n> city must be more than an efficient circuit diagram. Under his\n> multiphased scrutiny, the metropolis looked like an elaborate\n> mechanism, designed and constructed with utilitarian force. It had its\n> own clean lines and systematic efficiency, which resulted in a\n> completely serendipitous beauty . . . but there was no finesse\n> whatsoever.\n>\n> It was such a disappointment when the omniscient evermind refused to\n> live up to his potential. Sometimes, gloriously unrealistic human\n> ambitions had a certain merit.\n>\n> Omnius either ignored or intentionally refuted the graceful beauty of\n> Golden Age human architecture. But such cold and petulant superiority\n> was not logical. Admittedly, Erasmus could see a certain beauty in\n> streamlined machines and components--- he rather liked his own\n> burnished platinum skinfilm, the smooth grace of his mirrored face\n> with which he formed facial\n>\n> expressions. But he saw no point in maintaining ugliness just to spite\n> a perceived enemy's concept of beauty.\n>\n> How could a vast computer mind distributed across hundreds of planets\n> exhibit even a hint of narrow-mindedness? To Erasmus, with his\n> detached and mature understanding developed through long\n> contemplation, Omnius's attitude revealed a lack of comprehensive\n> thinking.\n>\n> Making the sound of an exaggerated sigh that he had copied from\n> humans, he transmitted a thought-command that caused projection shades\n> to drop over the windows in the bell tower. Choosing his mood, he\n> projected artificial, pastoral views from other worlds. So soothing\n> and peaceful.\n>\n> On one wall he paused at a clothing synthesizer, selected the design\n> he wanted, and waited while a garment was prepared for him. A\n> traditional painter's smock. When it was ready, he draped it over his\n> sleek body and crossed the room to an easel where he had already set\n> up a blank canvas, a palette of paints, and fine brushes.\n>\n> At a wave of his hand, the projection shades shifted to display\n> enlarged images of masterpiece paintings, each one highlighting a\n> different great master. He selected \"Cottages at Cordeville\" by an\n> ancient Earth artist, Vincent Van Gogh. It was bold and colorful but\n> basically crude in its implementation, with inept lines and childish\n> pigment applications that featured thick globs of paint and smears of\n> color. Yet when considered as a whole, the painting itself possessed a\n> certain raw energy, an indefinable primitive vibrancy.\n>\n> After deep concentration, Erasmus thought he had a delicate\n> understanding of Van Gogh's technique. But the comprehension of *why*\n> anyone would want to create it in the first place eluded him.\n>\n> Although he had never painted before, he copied the artwork exactly.\n>\n> Brushstroke for brushstroke, pigment for pigment. When he was\n> finished,\n>\n> Erasmus examined his masterpiece. \"There, the sincerest form of\n> flattery.\"\n>\n> The nearest wall-mounted screen brightened to a pale gray wash of\n> light. Omnius had been watching, as always. Erasmus would no doubt\n> have to justify his activities, since the evermind would never\n> understand what the independent robot was doing.\n>\n> He studied the painting again. Why was it so hard to understand\n> creativity? Should he just change some of the components at random and\n> call it an original work? As the robot finished his scrutiny,\n> satisfied that he had made no mistakes, that he had not deviated from\n> the tolerances he could see in the image of the painting, Erasmus\n> waited for a rush of comprehension.\n>\n> Slowly, he came to realize that what he had just completed was not\n> really *art*, any more than a printing press created literature. He\n> had only *copied* the ancient composition in every detail. He had\n> added nothing, synthesized no newness. And he burned with the need to\n> understand the difference.\n>\n> Frustrated, Erasmus took a different tack. In an implacable voice, he\n> summoned three servants and ordered them to carry his painting\n> supplies out to one of the laboratory buildings. \"I intend to create a\n> new work of art, all my own. A still life, of sorts. You three will be\n> vital parts of the process. Rejoice in your good fortune.\"\n>\n> In the sterile environment of the laboratory, with the cold assistance\n> of his personal robot guards, Erasmus proceeded to vivisect the trio\n> of victims, oblivious to their screams. \"I want to get to the heart of\n> the matter,\" he quipped, \"the lifeblood of it.\"\n>\n> With stained metal hands he studied the dripping organs, squeezed\n> them, watched their juices flow and cellular structures collapse. He\n> performed a cursory analysis, discovering sloppy mechanics and\n> inefficient circulatory systems that were unnecessarily complex and\n> prone to failure.\n>\n> Then, feeling a vibrant energy, an *impulsiveness*, Erasmus set up a\n> tableau to paint. A new work, completely unique! It would be his own\n> arrangement, and he would tint the images using different filters,\n> making a few intentional mistakes to better approximate human\n> imperfection and uncertainty.\n>\n> At last, he must be on the right track.\n>\n> At his command, the sentinel robots brought in a vat filled with\n> fresh, uncoagulated human blood. Erasmus began removing the\n> interesting array of human organs--- still warm to the touch--- from\n> his table, and instructed two cleaning drones to scrape out the\n> insides from the donor bodies. Contemplating the arrangement and\n> order, he dropped organ after organ into the blood and watched them\n> bob in the liquid--- eyes, livers, kidneys, hearts.\n>\n> Slowly assessing each step of the process, he set up exactly what his\n> \"creative urges\" told him to do. Whim upon whim. Erasmus added more\n> ingredients to the grisly stew. Pursuant to something he had learned\n> about the artist Van Gogh, he sliced an ear off one of the corpses and\n> tossed it into the vat as well.\n>\n> Finally, his metal hands dripping gore, he stepped back. A beautiful\n> arrangement--- one that was totally original to him. He could think of\n> no famous human artist who had worked on such a canvas. No one else\n> had ever done anything approaching this.\n>\n> Erasmus wiped his smooth metallic hands and began to paint upon a\n> virgin canvas. On the blank medium, he astutely drew one of the three\n> hearts, showing in perfect detail the ventricals, auricles, and aorta.\n> But this was not meant to be a realistic dissection image.\n> Dissatisfied, he smeared some of the lines to add an artistic flair.\n> True art required the right amount of uncertainty, just as gourmet\n> cooking needed the proper spices and flavors.\n>\n> This must be how creativity worked. As he painted, Erasmus tried to\n> imagine the kinesthetic relationship between his brain and his\n> mechanical fingers, the thought impulses that set the fingers into\n> motion.\n>\n> \"Is *that* what the humans define as art?\" Omnius said from a\n> wallscreen.\n>\n> For once, Erasmus did not debate with the evermind. Omnius was correct\n> in his skepticism. Erasmus had not attained true creativity. Yes, he\n> had produced an original and graphic arrangement. But in human\n> artwork, the\n>\n> sum of the components added up to more than the individual items. Just\n> ripping organs from victims, floating them in blood, and painting them\n> brought him no closer to understanding human inspiration. Even if he\n> manipulated the details, he remained imprecise and uninspired.\n>\n> Still, this might be a step in the right direction.\n>\n> Erasmus could not carry this thought to the next logical step, and he\n> came to understand why. The process was not ratiocinative at all.\n> Creativity and the precision of analysis were mutually exclusive.\n>\n> Frustrated, the robot gripped the macabre painting in his powerful\n> hands, broke the frame, and tore the canvas to shreds. He would have\n> to do better than this, much better. Erasmus shifted his metallic\n> polymer face to a stylized pensive mask. He was no closer to\n> comprehending humans, despite a century of intensive research and\n> musings.\n>\n> Walking slowly, Erasmus went to his private sanctuary, a botanical\n> garden where he listened to classical music piped through the cellular\n> structures of plants. \"Rhapsody in Blue,\" by a composer of Old Earth.\n>\n> In the contemplative garden, the troubled robot sat in the ruddy\n> sunlight and felt warmth on his metal skin. This was another thing\n> that humans seemed to enjoy, but he did not understand why. Even with\n> his sensory enhancement module, it just seemed like *heat*.\n>\n> And machines that overheated broke down.\n>\n> *The tapestry of the universe is vast and complex, with infinite\n> patterns. While threads of tragedy may form the primary weave,\n> humanity with its undaunted optimism still manages to embroider small\n> designs of happiness and love.*\n>\n> --- COGITOR KWYNA,\n\nCity of Introspection archives\n\n> **A**fter his long sojourn in space, Xavier could think only of being\n> home, and back in the warm embrace of Serena Butler.\n>\n> On furlough, he returned to the Tantor estate where he was welcomed by\n> his adoptive parents and their enthusiastic son Vergyl. The Tantors\n> were a soft-spoken older couple, gentle and intelligent, with dark\n> skin and hair the color of thick smoke. Xavier seemed to be cut from\n> the same mold, with similar interests and high moral values. He had\n> grown up in this warm and spacious manor house, which he still\n> considered home. Though he had legally inherited other Harkonnen\n> holdings--- mining and industrial operations on three planets--- many\n> rooms in the Tantor mansion were still set aside for his use.\n>\n> As he entered his familiar large suite, Xavier found a pair of shaggy\n> gray wolfhounds awaiting him, wagging their tails. He dropped his bags\n> and wrestled with the dogs. The animals, larger than his little\n> brother, were always playful and delighted to see him.\n>\n> That evening, the family feasted on the cook's specialty of sage fowl\n> roasted with honey, slivered nuts, and olives from the Tantors' own\n> groves. Unfortunately, after his exposure to the cymeks' searing gas,\n> the subtle nuances of flavors and aromas now eluded him. The cook gave\n> him an alarmed look when he dumped salt and seasoning--- which he\n> needed to taste anything at all--- onto the delicate food.\n>\n> Another thing the thinking machines had taken from him.\n>\n> Afterward, Xavier lounged in a heavy oak chair before a roaring fire,\n> sipping a red wine from the Tantor family vineyards--- also,\n> unfortunately, nearly tasteless. He luxuriated in relaxing at home,\n> away from military protocol. He had spent almost half a year aboard\n> the efficient but bare-bones Armada survey ships; tonight he would\n> sleep like a babe in his own bedchamber.\n>\n> One of the gray wolfhounds snored loudly, resting a furry muzzle on\n> Xavier's stockinged feet. Emil Tantor, with a fringe of smoky hair\n> around his bald crown, sat in the chair opposite his adopted son. Emil\n> asked about the strategic positions of the Synchronized Worlds and the\n> military capabilities of the Armada. \"What are the chances of the war\n> escalating after the attack on Zimia? Can we ever do more than drive\n> them back?\"\n>\n> Xavier finished his wine, poured another half glass for himself and a\n> full one for the older man, then sat back in the chair again, all\n> without disturbing the gray dog. \"The situation looks grim, Father.\"\n> Barely remembering his own parents, he had always called the Tantor\n> lord his father. \"But, then, it has always looked grim, ever since the\n> Time of Titans. Perhaps we lived too comfortably in the days of the\n> Old Empire. We forgot how to be ourselves, how to live up to our\n> potential, and for a thousand years afterward we've paid the price. We\n> were easy prey--- first for evil men, then for soulless machines.\"\n>\n> Emil Tantor sipped his wine, and stared into the fireplace. \"So is\n> there hope, at least? We must have something to cling to.\"\n>\n> Xavier's lips formed a gentle smile. \"We are human, Father. As long as\n> we hold onto that, there is always hope.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THE NEXT DAY Xavier sent a message to the Butler estate, asking\n> permission to accompany the Viceroy's daughter on the annual\n> bristleback hunt, scheduled in two days. Serena would already know\n> that Xavier had returned. His survey ships had arrived with much\n> fanfare, and Manion Butler would have been expecting his note.\n>\n> Still, Salusan society was formal and extravagant. In order to court\n> the beautiful daughter of the Viceroy, one had to bow to certain\n> expectations.\n>\n> In late morning a messenger pounded on the doors of the Tantor manor\n> house; Vergyl stood beside his big brother, grinning when he saw the\n> expression on Xavier's face. \"What is it? Can I come along? Did the\n> Viceroy say yes?\"\n>\n> Xavier made a mock-stern expression. \"How could he possibly turn down\n> the man who saved Salusa Secundus from the cymeks? Remember that,\n> Vergyl, if you ever wish to win the affections of a young lady.\"\n>\n> \"I need to save a *planet* just to have a girlfriend?\" The boy sounded\n> skeptical, though wary of outright disbelief when it came to Xavier's\n> words.\n>\n> \"For a woman as magnificent as Serena, that is exactly what you must\n> do.\" He strode into the great house to tell the Tantors his plans.\n>\n> The next dawn, Xavier dressed in his finest equestrian outfit and rode\n> into brightening daylight toward the Butler property. He borrowed his\n> father's chocolate-brown Salusan stallion, a fine beast with a braided\n> mane, narrow muzzle, and bright eyes. The animal's ears were large,\n> and its gait flowed without the jarring rhythm of less conditioned\n> horses. On the crest of a grassy hill stood a cluster of ornate\n> whitewashed buildings--- a main house, stables, servants' quarters,\n> and storage sheds arranged as outbuildings along the perimeter of a\n> split-rail fence. As his horse climbed, he saw impressive vistas of\n> the white spires of Zimia far behind him.\n>\n> A path paved with crushed limestone wound up to the crest. The gravel\n> crunched under the stallion's hooves as Xavier rode, breathing the\n> crisp air. He could feel the moist chill of early spring, saw fresh\n> leaves on the trees, a dazzle of wildflowers in their first bloom. But\n> each breath he drew into his new lungs smelled flat.\n>\n> Grapevines lined the hill like green corduroy, carefully tended and\n> watered, each vine tied to cables between stakes so that the clusters\n> would hang off the ground for easy picking. Twisted olive trees\n> surrounded the main house,\n>\n> their low branches awash with white flowers. Each year, the first\n> pressings of grapes and olives were cause for feasting in every\n> Salusan household; local vineyards vied against each other to see\n> which could produce the best vintages.\n>\n> As Xavier rode through the gates and into the courtyard, other\n> horsemen in hunting outfits milled about. Barking dogs dodged around\n> the stallion's legs, but the chocolate-brown horse stood majestically,\n> ignoring the hounds as if they were ill-mannered little boys.\n>\n> Contract huntsmen grabbed the leashes and pulled the dogs back into\n> order. A number of short black hunting horses pranced about, as\n> impatient as the dogs. Two of the huntsmen whistled loudly and others\n> joined them, ready to begin the day's festivities.\n>\n> Manion Butler strolled out of the stables, calling up his team like a\n> military commander positioning troops for battle. He glanced at the\n> young officer, raised a hand in greeting.\n>\n> Then Xavier saw Serena riding out on a gray mare with beautiful lines\n> and an ornate saddle. She wore high boots, jodhpurs, and a black\n> riding jacket. Her eyes were like electric sparks as her gaze met his.\n>\n> She cantered over to where Xavier sat astride his mount, a smile\n> forming at the edges of her mouth. Even with all the barking dogs,\n> restless horses, and shouting huntsmen, Xavier wanted to kiss her so\n> badly that he could barely restrain himself. Yet Serena remained\n> coolly formal, extending a gloved hand in greeting. He took it,\n> holding her fingertips.\n>\n> How he wished he could be telepathic like the Sorceresses of Rossak,\n> just to send her his thoughts. But from the obvious delight suffusing\n> her face, he thought Serena understood his feelings well enough, and\n> reciprocated them.\n>\n> \"The journeys across space were so long,\" he said. \"And I thought\n> about you all the time.\"\n>\n> \"*All* the time? You should have been concentrating on your duties.\"\n> She gave him a skeptical smile. \"Perhaps we can find time alone during\n> today's hunt, and you will tell me what you dreamed of.\"\n>\n> Playfully, she urged her gray mare to trot over to where her father\n> waited. Conscious of the eyes watching them, she and Xavier maintained\n> an acceptable distance. He rode forward and clasped her father's\n> black-gloved hand. \"I thank you for allowing me to participate in the\n> hunt, Viceroy.\"\n>\n> Manion Butler's florid face rearranged itself into a grin. \"I'm glad\n> you could join us, Tercero Harkonnen. This year I'm certain we'll\n> track down a bristleback. The beasts are definitely in these woods---\n> and I, for one, have been craving hams and roasts. And bristlebacon,\n> especially. There's nothing like it.\"\n>\n> Her eyes dancing, Serena looked at him. \"Perhaps, Father, if you\n> brought along fewer barking dogs, galloping horses, and men crashing\n> through the underbrush, some of those shy animals would be easier to\n> find.\"\n>\n> In response, Manion smiled as if she were still a precocious little\n> girl. Glancing at Xavier, he said, \"I'm glad you'll be there to\n> protect her, young man.\"\n>\n> The Viceroy raised his right arm. Horns sounded and a brass gong\n> clanged from the stables. The purebred hounds began to bay, clustering\n> toward the far fence. Ahead, the path led beyond the blossoming olive\n> groves and into the scrubby Salusan forest. Two eager-eyed boys swung\n> open the gates, already anticipating their first bristleback hunt.\n>\n> The party rode out like a rowdy gang, dogs pushing first through the\n> gates, followed by the big horses that carried the professional\n> huntsmen. Manion Butler rode with them, blowing an antique bugle that\n> had been with his family since Bovko Manresa's first settlement on\n> Salusa.\n>\n> The followers rode lesser mounts, hurrying behind the horses. These\n> helper crews would set up camp and dress and skin whatever wild game\n> the\n>\n> huntsmen caught. They would also prepare the feast once the party\n> returned to the main house.\n>\n> The hunters had already spread out, with each chief taking a point and\n> plunging into the outskirts of the forest. Unhurried, Xavier and\n> Serena trotted toward the dark green woods. One bright-eyed young man,\n> trailing behind, glanced over his shoulder and winked at Xavier, as if\n> he knew that the young couple had no intention of enjoying the hunt\n> for its own sake.\n>\n> Xavier urged his stallion forward. Serena rode beside him, and they\n> chose their own path through thinning trees to a muddy streambed wet\n> with spring flow. Smiling secretively at each other, they listened to\n> the distant sounds of dogs and her father's continuing bugle blasts.\n>\n> The Butler's private forest covered hundreds of acres, crisscrossed by\n> game trails. Mostly it was left as a preserve, with meadows and\n> sparkling creeks, nesting birds, and lush patches of flowers that\n> bloomed in successive splashes of color as the patches of crusty snow\n> faded.\n>\n> Xavier was simply happy to be alone with Serena. Riding side by side,\n> they brushed arms and shoulders, intentionally. He would reach up to\n> hold green branches away from her face, and Serena pointed out birds\n> and small animals, identifying them.\n>\n> In his comfortable hunting outfit, Xavier carried a sheathed\n> ceremonial dagger, a bullwhip, and a Chandler pistol that shot\n> jacketed crystal fragments. Serena carried her own knife and a small\n> pistol. But neither of them expected to bring down any prey. To them,\n> their hunt was for each other, and both knew it.\n>\n> Serena chose her path without hesitation, as if she had spent time\n> during Xavier's survey mission riding through the forest in search of\n> places where they could be alone. Finally, she led him through a stand\n> of dark pines to a meadow with tall grasses, starlike flowers, and\n> thick reeds taller than her head. The reeds surrounded a mirror-smooth\n> pond, a shallow old tarn created by winter snow melt and refreshed by\n> an underground spring.\n>\n> \"The water has bubbles in it,\" she said. \"It tingles your skin.\"\n>\n> \"Does that mean you want to go for a swim?\" Xavier's throat tightened\n> at the prospect.\n>\n> \"It'll be cold, but the spring has some natural heat. I'm willing to\n> risk it.\" With a smile, Serena dismounted and let her mare graze. She\n> heard a splash out in the pond, but the reeds blocked their view.\n>\n> \"Sounds like a lot of fish, too,\" Xavier said. He slid down from his\n> stallion, patted the muscular neck, and let his mount sniff at the\n> thick grasses and flowers near the gray mare.\n>\n> Serena pulled off her riding boots and stockings, then lifted her\n> loose jodhpurs above her knees as she walked barefoot into the rushes.\n> \"I'm going to test the water.\" She pushed the hollow grasses aside.\n>\n> Xavier checked the fastenings on his stallion's saddle. He worked open\n> one of the leather compartments and brought out a bottle of fresh\n> citrus water to share. He followed Serena toward the reeds, already\n> imagining how it would be to swim beside her, just the two of them\n> stroking naked through this lonely forest lake, kissing each other. .\n> . .\n>\n> Without warning, a monstrous bristleback charged out of the reeds,\n> spraying mud and water from its cool wallowing hole. Serena let out a\n> cry, more of alarm than terror, and fell backward into the mud.\n>\n> The bristleback pawed at the rushes with its cloven hooves. Long tusks\n> protruded from a squarish snout, each a bony maul for uprooting\n> saplings and eviscerating enemies. The animal had wide-set eyes, large\n> and black. It made loud grunts as if preparing to breathe fire. In\n> tales of great bristleback hunts, many men, hunting dogs, and horses\n> had died--- but there were so few of the animals anymore.\n>\n> \"Into the water, Serena!\"\n>\n> The bristleback turned as it heard his shout. Serena did exactly as\n> Xavier said, splashing away from the rushes, deeper into the pond. She\n> began to swim, knowing the boar could not charge her if she was in\n> deep enough water.\n>\n> The bristleback stomped out of the rushes. The two horses squealed and\n> skittered back toward the edge of the meadow.\n>\n> \"Look out, Xavier!\" Waist deep now, Serena drew her hunting knife, but\n> knew she couldn't help him.\n>\n> Xavier planted his legs firmly, held a knife in one hand and the\n> Chandler pistol in the other. Without flinching, he aimed the\n> crystal-shard weapon and shot the bristleback three times in the face.\n> The sharp projectiles tore through the animal's cheek and forehead,\n> gouging the thick skull. Another shot splintered one of the tusks. But\n> the bristleback kept charging toward him, caught up in its own\n> solitary stampede.\n>\n> Xavier fired twice more. The mangled creature bled profusely, mortally\n> wounded--- but even imminent death did not diminish its momentum. As\n> the beast thundered toward him, Xavier jumped to one side and slashed\n> the sharp knife across its throat, opening jugular and carotid\n> vessels. The bristleback turned, gushing blood upon him even as its\n> heart began to fade.\n>\n> The weight of the falling creature knocked Xavier to the ground, but\n> he wrestled it away, avoiding the convulsive thrusts of the razor\n> tusks. The killing done, Xavier climbed back to his feet and staggered\n> away, shivering in shock. His hunting outfit was soaked with the\n> beast's blood.\n>\n> He sprinted into the trampled rushes at the edge of the water.\n> \"Serena!\" \"I'm all right,\" she called, splashing toward the shore.\n>\n> He looked at his reflection in the placid pond, saw his shirt and face\n> covered with gore. He hoped none of it was his own. He cupped his\n> hands and splashed cool water on his skin, then dunked his head to\n> wash the stink from his hair. He scrubbed his hands with peaty sand.\n>\n> Serena came to him, her clothes drenched, wet hair clinging to her\n> skull. She used a corner of her riding jacket to dab the blood from\n> his neck and cheeks. Then she opened his shirt, wiping his chest as\n> well.\n>\n> \"I don't have a scratch on me,\" he said, not sure if it was true. The\n> skin on one side of his neck felt raw and hot, as if chafed, and his\n> chest was sore from the collision with the attacker. He clutched her\n> arm, pulling her closer. \"Are you sure you're not hurt? You aren't\n> cut, no bones broken?\"\n>\n> \"You're asking me?\" she said with teasing disbelief. \"*I'm* not the\n> brave boar fighter here.\"\n>\n> Serena kissed him. Her lips were cold from the water, but he held them\n> against his own, awakening her touch with his until their mouths\n> opened slightly, their breath warm inside each other as the kiss\n> deepened. He took her from the edge of the pond, through the rushes,\n> and to the soft meadow grass, far from the dead bristleback.\n>\n> The young lovers stroked the wet hair away from their ears and eyes,\n> and kissed again. The brush with death made them feel intensely alive.\n> Xavier's skin was hot, and his heart kept pounding, even though the\n> danger was past. A new excitement mounted. He wished he could better\n> enjoy the seductive scent of her perfume, but could detect only a\n> tantalizing thread.\n>\n> Serena's sodden clothes were cold, and Xavier noticed goosebumps on\n> her pale arms. All he could think to do was to remove the wet fabric.\n> \"Here, let me warm you.\"\n>\n> She helped him unfasten the black riding jacket and her blouse while\n> her own fingers worked at his bloodstained shirt. \"Just to make\n> certain you're not hurt,\" Serena said. \"I don't know what I would have\n> done if you'd been killed.\" Her words came fast and hard between\n> kisses.\n>\n> \"It takes more than a wild boar to keep me away from you.\"\n>\n> She yanked his shirt down over his shoulders and fumbled with his cuff\n> so she could take it off entirely. The meadow was soft and lush. The\n> horses\n>\n> munched patiently on grasses as Xavier and Serena made love without\n> restraint, expressing their pent-up passions, whispering and then\n> shouting their love for each other.\n>\n> The rest of the hunting party seemed far away, even though Xavier had\n> killed a bristleback and would have a dramatic story to tell during\n> the evening's feast. Of course, certain details would need to be\n> omitted. . . .\n>\n> For the moment, the war with the thinking machines did not exist. In\n> this brief and heady hour, they were just two human beings, alone and\n> in love.\n>\n> *There is a certain hubris to science, a belief that the more we\n> develop technology and the more we learn, the better our lives will\n> be.*\n>\n> --- TLALOC,\n\n*A Time for Titans*\n\n> **A**nything imagined can be made real . . . given sufficient genius.\n>\n> Tio Holtzman had said as much in a hundred speeches at the Lords\n> Council on Poritrin. His concepts and achievements sparked dreams and\n> fostered confidence in human technological capabilities against the\n> thinking machines.\n>\n> The mantra had also been picked up by his patron, Lord Niko Bludd, and\n> by representatives in the League of Nobles. Early in his career,\n> Holtzman had realized that it was not always the best scientists who\n> received the accolades or funding. Instead, it was the best *showmen*,\n> the most effective politicians.\n>\n> To be sure, Savant Holtzman was an adequate scientist. He had an\n> exceptional technical background and had achieved marked success with\n> his inventions and weapons systems, all of which had been put to good\n> use against Omnius. But he had arranged for more publicity and\n> attention than the inventions themselves warranted. Through his\n> oratory skills and by coloring certain details, he had constructed a\n> pedestal of fame on which he now stood. Holtzman had made himself into\n> the Hero of Poritrin, rather than just another nameless inventor. His\n> ability to enchant audiences, to spark a sense of wonder and\n> possibility in their minds, exceeded his scientific skills.\n>\n> To maintain his mythology, Holtzman constantly hungered for new\n> *ideas*--- which required inspiration and long periods of\n> uninterrupted thought. He liked to let possibilities roll like pebbles\n> down a steep mountain slope. Sometimes the pebbles would come to rest,\n> making a bit of noise but\n>\n> ultimately yielding nothing; on other occasions, such notions might\n> spark an avalanche.\n>\n> *Anything imagined can be made real*.\n>\n> But first it must be imagined, seen in the vision of the creator.\n>\n> After returning home from the devastation on Salusa Secundus, he had\n> booked himself a private cabin aboard a luxurious driftbarge, one of\n> the quiet zeppelin craft that rose from the delta city of Starda and\n> drifted inland on currents of warm air, cruising across the seemingly\n> endless Poritrin plains.\n>\n> Holtzman stood on the driftbarge's open deck, looking at the\n> grasslands that flowed in a sea of green and brown, dappled with\n> lakes. Below him, birds flew like schools of fish. The slow aircraft\n> floated with no hurry, no schedule.\n>\n> He stared toward the open horizon. Limitless distances, endless\n> possibilities. Hypnotic, meditative . . . inspirational. Such places\n> opened his mind, allowed him to pursue crazy concepts and run them\n> down like a predator pursuing prey.\n>\n> The driftbarge passed over geometric shapes like tattoos on the\n> ground, carefully sectioned acreage for the labor-intensive farming of\n> sweet cane. Other fields grew plump grains and fibrous threads to make\n> Poritrin cloth. Armies of human slaves worked the farms and ranches\n> like insects from a hive.\n>\n> Following a bucolic derivative of Navachristianity, the people of\n> Poritrin had outlawed computerized harvesting apparatus and restored\n> their society to humbler roots. Without sophisticated machinery, they\n> required a great deal of manual labor. Long ago, Sajak Bludd had been\n> the first League nobleman to introduce actual slavery as a means of\n> making large-scale agriculture viable.\n>\n> That Poritrin lord had justified his act by choosing only those who\n> owed a debt to humanity, mostly Buddislamic cowards who had fled\n> instead of fighting against the repressive Titans and thinking\n> machines. If they hadn't been afraid to help defend humanity, Sajak\n> Bludd said, their added numbers might have been enough to turn the\n> tide of war. Working the fields was a small enough price for their\n> descendants to pay. . . .\n>\n> Holtzman paced the driftbarge's deck, acquired a fluted glass of\n> sugary juice from a server, and sipped it as he pondered. Looking down\n> at the sea of grasses, he relished his mental sojourn. No distractions\n> . . . but as yet no inspiration, either. The great scientist often\n> embarked on such journeys to pull his thoughts together, simply\n> staring and thinking--- and *working*, though everyone else aboard\n> seemed to be taking a holiday.\n>\n> Because of Holtzman's previous successes, Niko Bludd gave him free\n> reign to develop whatever innovative defenses and weapons struck his\n> fancy. Unfortunately, during the past year the scientist had faced a\n> growing conviction that he was running out of ideas.\n>\n> Genius was nothing without creative impulse. Of course, the Savant\n> could coast for a while on his earlier triumphs. Still, he had to\n> offer up new inventions regularly, or even Lord Bludd would begin to\n> doubt him.\n>\n> Holtzman could never permit that. It was a matter of pride.\n>\n> He'd been embarrassed that the cymeks so easily penetrated his\n> scrambler shields on Salusa Secundus. How could he--- and all the\n> other engineers and technicians on the project--- have ignored the\n> fact that cymeks had human minds, not AI gelcircuitry? It was a\n> significant, devastating lapse.\n\nStill, the outpouring of faith and hope--- not to mention substantial\nfunding\n\n> --- made him feel a crippling pressure. The people would never allow\n> him to retire now. He must find some other solution, save the day once\n> more.\n>\n> While back in the blufftop laboratories at his Starda residence, he\n> searched constantly, reading dissertations and theoretical papers\n> transmitted to him, combing them for exploitable possibilities. Many\n> of the reports were\n>\n> esoteric, beyond even his comprehension, but occasionally an idea\n> struck his fancy.\n>\n> Holtzman had brought along numerous recordings for this mental sojourn\n> over the Poritrin plains. One ambitious and intriguing paper had been\n> written by an unknown theorist from Rossak named Norma Cenva. She had\n> no credentials, as far as he could determine, but her concepts were\n> nothing short of amazing. She thought of simple things in a completely\n> different light. He had a gut feeling about her, an instinct. And she\n> had such a low profile. . . .\n>\n> As starlight fell over the vast bowl of Poritrin sky, he sat alone in\n> his cabin drinking a warm fruity beverage. He stared at Norma's\n> calculations, working them repeatedly in his mind, watchful for errors\n> while trying to understand. This young, unknown mathematician seemed\n> to harbor no pretensions, as if she simply pulled new ideas out of the\n> clouds and wanted to share them with a man she considered her\n> intellectual comrade. Stymied by some of her derivations, he realized\n> that his doubts were more about his own lack of ability than about her\n> postulations. Norma Cenva seemed divinely inspired.\n>\n> Exactly what he needed.\n>\n> Restless, Holtzman thought long and hard into the night. Finally, with\n> the arrival of dawn, he relaxed and drifted off to sleep, his decision\n> made. The airborne barge rocked in gentle breezes and continued to\n> float across the flat landscape. He dozed off with a smile on his\n> face.\n>\n> Soon he would meet Norma for himself. Perhaps some of her concepts\n> might be applicable to devices he wanted to employ against the\n> thinking machines.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THAT AFTERNOON THE Savant wrote a personal invitation to Norma Cenva\n> and dispatched it to Rossak by League courier. This young woman\n>\n> who had grown up isolated in the jungles just might prove to be his\n> salvation . . . if he handled the situation properly.\n>\n> *Opportunities are a tricky crop, with tiny flowers that are difficult\n> to see and even more difficult to harvest.*\n>\n> --- ANONYMOUS\n>\n> **F**eeling like an intruder, Norma Cenva stood in her mother's study,\n> overlooking the canopied purple trees. A sour, misty rain fell\n> outside; some of the droplets from the high skies contained impurities\n> and poisonous chemicals from spewing volcanic fumes in the distance.\n> On the far horizon, she monitored dark clouds as they drew closer.\n> Soon there would be a downpour.\n>\n> What did Aurelius Venport want her to find in here?\n>\n> Her stern mother maintained an austere room with chalky-white interior\n> walls. An alcove contained the Sorceress's fine clothes, articles that\n> were much too large and fanciful for Norma to wear. Zufa Cenva had an\n> intimidating beauty, a luminous purity that made her as perfect--- and\n> as hard--- as a classic sculpture. Even without telepathic powers, she\n> could draw men like ants to honey.\n>\n> But the chief Sorceress had only a superficial loveliness, concealing\n> an implacability about subjects she never permitted Norma to see. It\n> wasn't that Zufa didn't trust her daughter; she simply considered the\n> girl beneath grand concerns. Like her telepathic companions, Zufa\n> seemed to thrive on secrecy.\n>\n> But Aurelius had seen something here. \"You won't be sorry if you find\n> it, Norma,\" he had told her, smiling. \"I trust your mother to tell you\n> about it eventually . . . but I don't believe it is high in her\n> priorities.\"\n>\n> *I have never been high in her priorities.* Curious, but wary of being\n> caught, Norma continued to investigate.\n>\n> Her gaze settled on a fibersheet notebook resting on a worktable. The\n> thick book had a maroon cover with indecipherable lettering as arcane\n> as the\n>\n> mathematical notations Norma had developed. Once, eavesdropping on the\n> Sorceresses and their intricate plans, Norma heard them refer to their\n> private language as \"Azhar.\"\n>\n> Since returning from Salusa Secundus, her mother had been even more\n> detached and aloof than usual. She seemed driven to attempt greater\n> things, because of the cymek attack. When Norma inquired about the war\n> effort, Zufa had merely frowned at her. \"We will take care of it.\"\n>\n> The chief Sorceress spent much of her time sequestered with a\n> cabalistic clique of women, whispering secret things. Zufa had a fresh\n> passion, a new idea to use against the thinking machines. If her\n> mother had dreamed of any way Norma could contribute, she would have\n> pressed the dwarf girl into service. Instead, Zufa had entirely\n> written off her daughter without giving her a chance.\n>\n> The most talented women, numbering around three hundred, had\n> established a security zone in the deep fungoid jungle, cutting off\n> the pharmaceutical scavengers hired by Aurelius Venport. Any explorer\n> who ventured into the secluded area encountered strange shimmering\n> barricades.\n>\n> Ever alert, Norma had noticed unexplained explosions and fires out\n> where Zufa's hand-picked Sorceresses spent weeks of intensive\n> training. Her mother rarely came back to her cliffside chambers. . . .\n>\n> Now, in her mother's room, Norma discovered two pieces of fine white\n> paper beneath the maroon notebook: the bleached parchment often used\n> by League couriers. This must be what Aurelius had wanted her to find.\n>\n> Dragging a stepstool to the table, she climbed up. She could see the\n> heading on the top sheet of parchment--- a formal document from\n> Poritrin. Curious, afraid her mother might return from the jungles,\n> she removed the pages and was astonished to read in black chancery\n> lettering, SAVANT TIO HOLTZMAN.\n>\n> For what possible purpose had the great inventor written a letter to\n> her mother? Leaning down, the girl read the salutation line: \"Dear\n> Norma\n>\n> Cenva.\" With a scowl, she scanned the message, then reread it with\n> mounting delight mixed with anger. *Tio Holtzman wants me to\n> apprentice with him on Poritrin! He thinks I am brilliant? I can't\n> believe it*.\n>\n> Her own mother had attempted to conceal, or at least delay, the\n> transmittal! Zufa had said nothing, possibly unable to believe the\n> Savant would want anything to do with her daughter. Luckily, Aurelius\n> had told her about it.\n>\n> Norma hurried off to the business district of the cliffside\n> settlement. She found Venport in a tea shop, concluding a meeting with\n> a seedy-looking trader. As the dark-skinned man rose from his seat,\n> Norma hurried over with her off-kilter gait and slid into his place at\n> the table.\n>\n> Venport smiled warmly at her. \"You look excited, Norma. You must have\n> found the letter from Savant Holtzman?\"\n>\n> She thrust the parchment forward. \"My mother tried to prevent me from\n> seeing his offer!\"\n>\n> \"Zufa is a maddening woman, I know, but you must try to understand\n> her. Since neither of us can do the things she values most, Zufa\n> disregards our abilities. Oh, she's aware of your mathematical\n> talents, Norma, and she knows I'm a competent businessman, but our\n> skills do not count for anything with her.\"\n>\n> Norma squirmed on the seat, not wanting to give her mother the benefit\n> of the doubt. \"Then why did she hide this letter?\"\n>\n> Venport laughed. \"She was probably embarrassed by the attention you\n> received.\" He squeezed her hand. \"Don't worry, I will intervene if\n> your mother attempts to block this. In fact, since she's so\n> preoccupied with the other Sorceresses, I can't see how she would\n> object if I were to complete the necessary paperwork for you.\"\n>\n> \"You would do that? Doesn't my mother---\"\n>\n> \"Let me take care of everything. I'll handle her.\" He gave Norma a\n> quick, warm hug. \"I believe in what you can do.\"\n>\n> Acting in Zufa's stead, Aurelius Venport dispatched a formal letter of\n> response to the famous inventor, agreeing to send Norma away. The\n> young woman would study with him on Poritrin and assist him in his\n> laboratories. For Norma, it was the opportunity of a lifetime.\n>\n> Her mother might not even notice she was gone.\n>\n> *Home can be anywhere, for it is a part of one's self.*\n>\n> --- Zensunni saying\n>\n> **E**ven in the wasteland, with wind whipping around him, Selim's luck\n> continued to hold. Survival itself became a wondrous game out in the\n> desert.\n>\n> Leaving the dead sandworm behind, he'd tried to find a small cave or\n> gully in the rocks where he could crouch from the approaching storm.\n> Desperately thirsty, Selim poked around for any signs of human\n> habitation, though he doubted any other man had ever set foot so far\n> out in the arid wilderness.\n>\n> Certainly no one who had lived.\n>\n> After wandering from planet to planet, the Zensunni had come to\n> Arrakis, where they scattered in widely separated settlements. For\n> several generations, the scavenger people had scraped a meager\n> existence from the desert, but only occasionally did they venture from\n> their protected areas, fearful of giant worms.\n>\n> The wild sandworm had taken Selim far from the spaceport, far from the\n> vital supplies that even the most resourceful Zensunni would require.\n> His prospects for survival seemed bleak indeed.\n>\n> So when he stumbled upon an ancient botanical testing station\n> camouflaged in the rocks, Selim could hardly believe his good fortune.\n> Undoubtedly, it was another sign from Buddallah. A miracle!\n>\n> He stood before the domed enclosure erected by long-forgotten\n> ecologists who had studied Arrakis and found it wanting. Perhaps a few\n> Old Empire scientists had lived here and recorded data during a storm\n> season. The rugged structure consisted of several low outbuildings\n> built into the rocks, half-disguised by time and windblown sand.\n>\n> As the howling tempest peppered him with stinging sand, Selim\n> scrambled around the abandoned station. He saw tilted weather vanes,\n> dented wind collectors and other data-gathering devices that looked\n> long dead. Most important, he found an entry hatch.\n>\n> With sore hands and aching arms from his worm-riding ordeal, Selim\n> pounded against the barrier, searching for a way inside. He scooped\n> powdery debris away, looking for some sort of manual mechanism, since\n> batteries would have long since died. He needed to get into the\n> shelter before the storm wind slammed into him with full intensity.\n>\n> Selim had heard of such places. A few had been found and raided by\n> Zensunni scavengers. These self-reliant stations had been placed on\n> Arrakis during humanity's glory days, before the thinking machines had\n> taken over, before Buddislamic refugees had fled to safety. This\n> automated facility was at least a thousand years old, probably more.\n> But in the desert, where the environment remained unchanged for\n> millennia, time ran at a different pace.\n>\n> Selim finally located the mechanism that controlled the hatch. As he\n> had feared, the power cells were dead, providing only enough of a\n> spark to make the door groan open the barest crack.\n>\n> The wind howled. Blown sand hung like fog on the horizon, obscuring\n> the sun. Dust tingled against his raw ears and face, and Selim knew it\n> would soon become a deadly scouring.\n>\n> Growing more desperate, he wedged his sandworm tooth into the dark\n> opening and used it as a pry bar. The aperture widened a little, but\n> not enough. Cold, stale air gasped out. He used the aching muscles in\n> his arms, dug his feet against the rocks to throw his body weight into\n> the effort, and pushed hard on the makeshift lever.\n>\n> With a last groan of resistance, the hatch grated partway open. Selim\n> laughed and tossed the curved worm fang into the interior, where it\n> made a tinkling clatter on the metal floor. He squirmed through into\n> the station, heard the muffled roar of the sandstorm increasing\n> outside. It was on top of him.\n>\n> Impeded by wind and blown sand, Selim grasped the lip of the hatch and\n> pushed hard. Incoming sand fell through a grating in the floor, into a\n> receptacle below. He needed to hurry. The wind let up for only a\n> second, but that was enough. He got the door shut, sealing himself in,\n> away from the violent weather.\n>\n> Safe . . . unbelievably safe. He laughed at his good fortune, then\n> gave a prayer of thanks, more sincere than any he had uttered in his\n> life. How could he question such blessings?\n>\n> Selim used the shaft of wan daylight to look around. Luckily, the\n> abandoned station had plaz windows. Though scratched and pitted from\n> prolonged exposure, they allowed fading illumination inside.\n>\n> The place was like a cave of treasure. Guided by the dust-filtered\n> light from the windows, he found a few old glowstrips which he coaxed\n> into brightening the small shelter. Then he ransacked cupboards and\n> storage vaults. Much of what remained was useless: unreadable\n> data-plaques, dead computerized recording systems, strange instruments\n> that bore the names of archaic corporations. He did, however, find\n> capsules of well-preserved food that had not deteriorated even in all\n> the time this facility had been abandoned.\n>\n> He broke open a capsule and ate the contents. Though the flavors were\n> unusual, the food tasted wonderful, and he felt energy seeping back\n> into his weary flesh. Other containers held concentrated juices, which\n> were like ambrosia to him. Most valuable of all, he found distilled\n> water, hundreds of literjons of it. Undoubtedly it had been collected\n> over the centuries by automated moisture extractors left behind by the\n> long-ago scientific expedition.\n>\n> This was personal wealth beyond anything Selim had imagined possible.\n> He could pay back the brackish water he'd been accused of taking from\n> the tribe a thousand times over. He could return to the Zensunni as a\n> hero. Naib Dhartha would have to forgive him. But Selim had never\n> committed the crime in the first place.\n>\n> While Selim sat comfortable and satisfied, he vowed never to give\n> Dhartha the satisfaction of seeing him return. Ebrahim had betrayed\n> his friendship, and the corrupt Naib had falsely condemned him. His\n> own people had exiled him, never expecting him to survive. Now that he\n> had found a way to live by himself, why would Selim ever want to go\n> back and surrender it all?\n>\n> For two straight nights, the young man slept. At dawn on the second\n> day he awoke and opened more of the sealed boxes and cabinets. He\n> discovered tools, rope, durable fabric, construction material. The\n> possibilities filled him with joy, and Selim found himself chuckling\n> all alone inside the botanical testing station.\n>\n> *I'm alive!*\n>\n> The storm had rattled past as he slept, unsuccessfully scratching\n> against the walls of the shelter like a monster trying to get in. Most\n> of the sand had been deflected, so very little was piled around the\n> enclosure. From the vantage of the station's largest window, Selim\n> gazed across the desert sea that he had crossed on the back of the\n> sandworm. The dunes were fresh and spotless. All signs of the dead\n> worm had been erased, scoured clean. Only this solitary young man\n> remained.\n>\n> He envisioned a long journey ahead of him, and thought he must have a\n> particular calling. Why else would Buddallah have gone to so much\n> trouble to allow poor Selim to live?\n>\n> *What do you want me to do?*\n>\n> Smiling, the outcast looked out upon the desert, wondering how he\n> could possibly cross such an expanse again. The vista filled him with\n> a sensation of supreme solitude. He made out a few rocks in the\n> distance, etched by eternal winds. Here and there were a few hardy\n> plants. Small animals scurried into burrows. Dune merged into dune,\n> desert into desert.\n>\n> Enthralled by his own memories and feeling recklessly invulnerable,\n> Selim decided what he must do, sooner or later. The first time had\n> been an incredible fluke, but he understood better how to do it now.\n>\n> He must ride a sandworm again. And the next time it would not be an\n> accident.\n>\n> *One of the questions the Butlerian Jihad answered with violence was\n> whether the human body is simply a machine that a* man-made *machine\n> can duplicate.

The situation reminded both of them of a thousand years\n> before, when twenty Titans had conquered the Old Empire by trampling\n> the bodies of their foes.\n>\n> This was the way it should be. It only whetted their appetite for\n> more.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> PRIOR TO THE attack, Agamemnon had studied Giedi Prime's defenses,\n> analyzing images taken by spy watcheyes that zoomed through the system\n> like tiny meteoroids. From those readings, the cymek general had\n> concocted a brilliant tactical move, exploiting a slight weakness in\n> planetary defenses. Omnius had been willing to pay the necessary price\n> to take over a League World, and it had not cost the life of a single\n> Titan, not even one of the lesser neo-cymeks. Only a single robotic\n> cruiser. Perfectly acceptable, as far as Agamemnon was concerned.\n>\n> The humans had erected scrambler fields here like those on Salusa,\n> centering their transmitting towers in Giedi City. The field-generator\n> facility had been guarded by kindjal fighter craft, supposedly\n> impregnable embankments, and massively armored ground vehicles. The\n> feral humans had learned a lesson on Salusa Secundus. But it was not\n> enough to protect them from obliteration.\n>\n> Giedi Prime's first-line orbital protective forces had been brushed\n> aside by the unstoppable force of the giant machine fleet. All robot\n> losses were acceptable. When Agamemnon led the cymek ships in, along\n> with the sacrificial cruisers, the planetbound human defenders could\n> not hope to drive them back.\n>\n> To begin the assault, the huge robotic cruiser had positioned itself\n> above Giedi Prime, its cargo holds filled with explosives. Dozens of\n> other robot\n>\n> cruisers moved with machine grace, sleek and streamlined, lining up\n> for the assault. Guided by a thinking machine intelligence, the\n> enormous craft fired its engines and accelerated at full speed toward\n> its target.\n>\n> \"Descent approach in progress,\" the battleship's robot mind had\n> reported, transmitting images to the waiting fighters. Ahead, thirty\n> decoy vessels shot downward, also hoping to strike the target but\n> designed to be targets for the ground-based missile defenses. The plan\n> relied on brute force and overwhelming numbers, not finesse.\n> Nevertheless, it would be effective.\n>\n> With its engines at full speed, the sacrificial vessel had accelerated\n> white-hot into Giedi Prime's atmosphere, faster than any ground-based\n> human missile defenses could target and respond. The other cruisers\n> approached the invisible scrambler shield. Already, gray-white\n> blossoms of smoke and explosions marked where the ground-launched\n> missiles had found targets. The numbers dwindled, as did the distance.\n> The humans could never stop all the invaders.\n>\n> The doomed robot ship sent final images back to the watcheyes so\n> Omnius would have a complete record of the conquest of Giedi Prime.\n> Every nanosecond--- until it passed through the scrambler net, which\n> effectively erased the AI guidance brain. The transmissions became\n> static, then an empty carrier wave.\n>\n> Still, the juggernaut had continued to descend. Even with its\n> gelcircuitry brain neutralized, the plummeting cruiser fell like an\n> asteroidsized hammer.\n>\n> Kindjal fighter craft directly engaged the last explosive-laden\n> vessel, but the inbound ship was too big and too hot to be swerved.\n> The defenders' shots amounted to little more than pellets.\n>\n> The giant dead vessel slammed into the field transmitters on the\n> outskirts of Giedi City. A crater half a kilometer wide flashed into\n> steam; the transmitters, the overwhelmed defenses, and the surrounding\n> inhabited areas all vanished.\n>\n> Shockwaves had toppled buildings for kilometers around and shattered\n> windows. Holtzman's scrambler shields were neutralized in the blink of\n> an eye, and the Giedi Home Guard was crippled.\n>\n> After that, the cymeks and robots had come down in full force.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> \"BARBAROSSA, MY FRIEND, shall we make our grand entrance?\" Agamemnon\n> said, arriving at the residence of the Magnus.\n>\n> \"Just like when we followed Tlaloc into the halls of the Old Empire,\"\n> his fellow Titan agreed. \"It has been a long time since I've enjoyed a\n> victory so much.\"\n>\n> They led enthusiastic neo-cymeks easily through the reeling\n> metropolis. The stunned human inhabitants could not even put up a\n> fight. Behind the cymek conquerors marched robotic troops to help\n> secure the territory.\n>\n> Although part of Giedi Prime's population might flee underground and\n> hide, the citizenry would break, given time. It might take years to\n> root out the last cells of feral resistance. No doubt the conquering\n> machines would endure decades of guerrilla strikes by misguided\n> vigilantes, survivors of the Giedi Home Guard who thought a few\n> gnat-bites would make the invaders pack up and go away. Resistance\n> groups would be a futile exercise, but he had no doubt the locals\n> would try some such foolishness.\n>\n> Agamemnon wondered if he should bring in Ajax to complete the cleanup.\n> The brutal cymek warlord particularly enjoyed hunting humans, as he\n> had proved so effectively during the Hrethgir Rebellions on Walgis. As\n> soon as they installed a copy of the evermind in the ashes of Giedi\n> City, Agamemnon would make appropriate recommendations to the new\n> incarnation of Omnius.\n>\n> Agamemnon and Barbarossa smashed open the front of the governor's\n> residence, clearing an area wide enough for their reinforced bodies.\n> In their wake, soldier robots, much smaller than the cymeks'\n> warrior-forms, flooded\n>\n> into the building. Within moments, the robots brought blond-haired\n> Magnus Sumi before the two Titans.\n>\n> \"We claim your planet in the name of Omnius,\" Barbarossa declared.\n> \"Giedi Prime is now a Synchronized World. We require your cooperation\n> to consolidate our victory.\"\n>\n> Magnus Sumi, trembling with fear, nevertheless spat on the broken\n> floor where the weight of the cymek warrior-forms had crushed his\n> carefully laid tiles.\n>\n> \"Bow to us,\" Barbarossa said.\n>\n> The Magnus laughed. \"You're mad. I would never---\"\n>\n> Agamemnon swung one of his sleek metal arms sideways. He had not fully\n> tested this new body and was not aware of the magnitude of his\n> strength. He had meant to strike the governor in the face, an\n> instinctive angry slap. Instead, the arm delivered a blow so forceful\n> that it ripped the man's torso in half. The two parts of his body\n> thudded against the far wall in a splatter of gore.\n>\n> \"Oh, well. My demand was a mere formality anyway.\" Agamemnon turned\n> optic threads toward his comrade. \"Begin your work, Barbarossa. These\n> robots will assist.\"\n>\n> The Titan programming genius began dismantling the household systems\n> in the governor's residence and setting up power conduits and\n> machinery. He added linkages and installed a blank, resilient\n> gelsphere mainframe into which he uploaded the newest version of\n> Omnius's mind.\n>\n> The process took several hours, during which the thinking machine\n> invasion force moved through the city, putting out fires and shoring\n> up damaged industrial buildings that Agamemnon considered important\n> for the planet's continued utility.\n>\n> The habitation complexes of the surviving humans, though, were left to\n> burn. The suffering people could fend for themselves. Misery would\n> help them understand the hopelessness of their position.\n>\n> Floating overhead, the annoying watcheyes recorded everything. At\n> least it was a victory this time. Agamemnon revealed no sign of his\n> impatience or displeasure, knowing that resistance against the\n> computer evermind would be fruitless. *For now*. Instead, he must\n> select the proper place and time.\n>\n> Once installed and activated, the new incarnation of Omnius would show\n> no appreciation toward the two seemingly loyal Titans for their\n> victory, nor would the evermind begrudge the loss of his machine\n> juggernaut. It was a military operation well executed, and the\n> Synchronized Worlds had now added one of humanity's jewels to its\n> empire. A psychological and strategic success.\n>\n> When the immense download was finally complete, Agamemnon activated\n> the new copy of the distributed evermind. Systems surged alive, and\n> the omniscient computer began to survey its new domain.\n>\n> \"Welcome, Lord Omnius,\" Agamemnon said to the wallspeakers. \"I present\n> to you the gift of another world.\"\n>\n> *We are happiest when planning our futures, letting our optimism and\n> imagination run unrestrained. Unfortunately, the universe does not\n> always heed such plans.*\n\n--- ABBESS LIVIA BUTLER,\n\nprivate journals\n\n> **A**lthough their marriage was a foregone conclusion, Serena and\n> Xavier happily endured the extravagant betrothal banquet thrown by\n> Viceroy Manion Butler at his hilltop estate.\n>\n> Emil and Lucille Tantor had brought baskets of apples and pears from\n> their orchards and huge jars of herbed olive oil for dipping the\n> fresh-baked engagement rolls.

The women secured their dark hair with\n> jeweled combs and wore white dresses adorned with embroidered\n> patterns. The flowing skirts flew like whirlwinds about their waists,\n> while dapper gentlemen strutted around them like peacocks in a mating\n> challenge. Brassy music offset by soulful balisets drifted through the\n> afternoon.\n>\n> Xavier and Serena wore impressive outfits befitting a proud military\n> officer and the talented daughter of the League Viceroy. They strolled\n> among the assembled guests, careful to address each family\n> representative by name. The couple sampled prized wines from dusty\n> bottles brought in by the scions of every household. Xavier, who could\n> taste none of the subtleties in the vintages, took care not to get too\n> drunk; he was already giddy at the prospect of his upcoming marriage.\n>\n> Serena's sister Octa, two years younger, seemed equally excited. With\n> her long chestnut hair adorned by fresh cornflowers, Octa's eyes were\n> wide\n>\n> with amazement, enchanted by her sister's beau and fantasizing about a\n> handsome young officer who might be her own husband one day.\n>\n> Amazingly, Serena's reclusive mother Livia came to spend the\n> celebratory weekend at the Butler manor. Manion's wife rarely left the\n> City of Introspection, a retreat where she kept herself from the cares\n> and nightmares of the world. The enlightened philosophical preserve,\n> owned by a Butler trust, had originally been established to study and\n> ponder the Zen Hekiganshu of III Delta Pavonis, the Tawrah and\n> Talmudic Zabur, even the Obeah Ritual. But under Butler patronage, the\n> City had gradually blossomed into something the likes of which had not\n> been seen for millennia.\n>\n> Xavier had not seen Serena's mother often, especially in recent years.\n> With her tanned skin and lean features, Livia Butler was a handsome\n> beauty. She rejoiced in the betrothal of her daughter and seemed to\n> enjoy herself as she danced with her jovial husband or sat beside him\n> at the banquet table. She looked not at all like a woman who had fled\n> from the world.\n>\n> Years ago, Livia and Manion's strong marriage had been envied by many\n> noble families. Serena was their eldest child, but they also had twins\n> two years younger: the calm and shy Octa and a sensitive, intelligent\n> boy, Fredo. While Serena underwent political schooling, the twins were\n> raised as close companions, though neither had the far-ranging\n> aspirations of their older sister.\n>\n> Fredo had been fascinated by musical instruments and folk songs,\n> traditions from the grandest planets of the former Empire. He learned\n> to be a musician and poet, while Octa was intrigued with painting and\n> sculpture. In Salusan society, artisans and creative people were\n> highly respected, as admirable as any politician.\n>\n> But at the age of fourteen, honey-voiced Fredo died of a wasting\n> disease, his skin splotched with purplish discolorations. For months,\n> he'd grown thinner and thinner, his muscles atrophying. His blood\n> would not clot, and he could not keep even the thinnest of broths in\n> his stomach. The Salusan\n>\n> doctors had never seen anything like it. Frantic, Viceroy Butler\n> begged the League for help.\n>\n> The men of Rossak offered a number of experimental drugs from their\n> fungoid jungles to treat Fredo's undiagnosed malady. Livia insisted on\n> trying everything. Unfortunately, the young man reacted poorly to the\n> third Rossak drug, an allergic response that caused his throat to\n> swell. Fredo went into convulsions and stopped breathing.\n>\n> Octa had mourned the loss of her brother and came to fear for her own\n> life as well. Fredo's disease was eventually determined to be\n> genetically based, meaning that she and her older sister were at risk\n> of contracting the fatal malady themselves. Octa took care with her\n> health and lived each day dreading that her life would come to a slow,\n> painful end like that of her brother.\n>\n> Fiercely confident and optimistic, Serena always tried to console her\n> sister, giving her a shoulder to cry on, offering encouragement.\n> Though neither sister had shown signs of the strange disease, Octa's\n> dreams had lost all momentum, and she gave up her artwork, becoming a\n> quieter, more pensive soul. She was a frail teenager now, hoping for a\n> spark of wonder to bring her back to the fullness of life.\n>\n> Though her husband had a brilliant political career and his importance\n> grew with each season, formerly vivacious Livia had withdrawn from\n> public life to her spiritual retreat, where she focused on\n> philosophical and religious pursuits. She donated large sums to the\n> imposing fortress to build additional meditation chambers, temples,\n> and libraries. After devoting many sleepless nights to frank\n> discussions with the Cogitor Kwyna, Livia became the Abbess of the\n> facility.\n>\n> In the aftermath of the tragedy, Manion Butler had immersed himself in\n> League work, while Serena felt a heavier burden and set higher goals.\n> Though she could do nothing to help her brother, she wanted to stop\n> the suffering of other people whenever she could. She plunged into\n> politics, working to stop the practice of human slavery still common\n> on some\n>\n> League Worlds, and pledging herself to finding a way to overthrow the\n> thinking machines. No one had ever accused her of lacking in vision or\n> energy. . . .\n>\n> Living separate lives now, Manion and Livia Butler remained pillars of\n> Salusan society, proud of each other's accomplishments--- not\n> divorced, not even emotionally separated . . . just following\n> different paths. Xavier knew that Serena's mother occasionally came\n> back to spend nights with her husband and enjoy weekends with her\n> daughters. But she always returned to the City of Introspection.\n>\n> Serena's betrothal had been important enough to bring her mother into\n> the public eye again. After Xavier danced with his future bride four\n> times in a row, Abbess Livia insisted on having a dance with her\n> future son-in-law.\n>\n> Later, during a long acoustic set of the Long March Ballads played by\n> native Salusan minstrels, Xavier and Serena slipped into the manor\n> house, leaving Livia to weep unabashedly as she watched the musicians\n> and remembered how Fredo had wanted to become a player himself. Manion\n> sat beside his wife, rocking her gently.\n>\n> At the event in their honor, Xavier and Serena had by now experienced\n> their fill of company and revelry, of greeting guests and sampling\n> food and wine. They laughed at every witticism, whether subtle or\n> crude, so as not to offend the grand families. By now, the two were\n> desperate for just a few moments alone.\n>\n> Finally they slipped away and hurried through the corridors of the\n> manor house, past hot kitchens and musty storerooms, to a small alcove\n> outside the Winter Sun room. In winter, slanted sunshine lit this room\n> with bronze rainbows. The Butler family traditionally took their\n> breakfasts here during the cold season, enjoying family conversation\n> while they watched the rising sun. It was a place of fond memories for\n> Serena.\n>\n> She crowded with Xavier into the alcove just outside the room;\n> glow-panels shone in the hall, but still allowed a few rich shadows.\n> Serena pulled him close and kissed him. He placed a hand behind her\n> neck and stroked her\n>\n> hair as he pulled her face close to his and kissed more deeply, hungry\n> for her.\n>\n> When they heard hurried footsteps in the hall, the lovers hid in\n> silence, quietly chuckling at their secret rendezvous. But fresh-faced\n> Octa easily found them. Flushed with embarrassment, Octa averted her\n> gaze. \"You must come back to the banquet hall. Father is ready to\n> serve dessert. And an offworld messenger is coming.\"\n>\n> \"A messenger?\" Xavier suddenly sounded military and formal. \"From\n> whom?\"\n>\n> \"He went to Zimia demanding an audience with the League Parliament,\n> but since most of the nobles are here for the banquet, he's on his way\n> up the hill.\"\n>\n> Bending his elbows outward, Xavier offered an arm to each sister. \"Let\n> us go together so we can hear what this messenger has to say.\" Forcing\n> a lighthearted tone, he said, \"After all, I haven't eaten enough\n> today. I could use a bowl of roast custard and a whole plateful of\n> candied eggs.\"\n>\n> Octa giggled, but Serena gave him a mock stern frown. \"I suppose I\n> must resign myself to life with a fat husband.\"\n>\n> They entered the large hall, where the guests gathered around a long\n> table, complimenting the array of extraordinarily beautiful desserts\n> that looked too precious to be eaten. Manion and Livia Butler stood\n> side by side, raising a toast to the couple.\n>\n> Sipping politely from his wine, Xavier detected an undercurrent of\n> worry in the Viceroy's manner. Everyone pretended to be unconcerned\n> about what news the messenger might bring, but the moment a pounding\n> sounded on the door, all activity stopped. Manion Butler himself\n> opened the wooden portal, gesturing for the man to enter.\n>\n> He wasn't a formal courier. His eyes were haunted and his officer's\n> uniform unkempt, as if he no longer cared about protocol or\n> appearances. Xavier\n>\n> recognized the insignia of the Giedi Prime Home Guard. Like other\n> League uniforms, it bore the gold sigil of free humanity on the lapel.\n>\n> \"I have grave news, Viceroy Butler. The fastest ships have brought me\n> directly here.\"\n>\n> \"What is it, young man?\" Manion's voice was filled with dread.\n>\n> \"Giedi Prime has fallen to the thinking machines!\" The officer raised\n> his voice against the guests' disbelieving outcries. \"The robots and\n> cymeks found a flaw in our defenses and destroyed our scrambler-field\n> transmitters. Much of our population has been slaughtered and the\n> survivors enslaved. A new Omnius evermind has already been activated.\"\n>\n> The people in the hall wailed at hearing of the devastating defeat.\n> Xavier clutched Serena's hand so tightly he feared he might hurt her.\n> Inside, he had turned to stone, his stomach filled with a cold\n> heaviness.\n>\n> He had just been to Giedi Prime, had inspected the defenses himself.\n> Xavier had been terribly anxious to finish his inspection tour so that\n> he could return to Serena. Could he possibly have missed something? He\n> squeezed his eyes shut as the questions and disbelieving comments\n> turned to a buzz around him. Was he to blame? Had a simple mistake, a\n> bit of impatience from a young man in love, caused an entire planet to\n> fall?\n>\n> Manion Butler placed both palms on the table to steady himself. Livia\n> reached over to touch her husband's shoulder, adding silent support.\n> She closed her eyes, and her lips moved as if in prayer.\n>\n> The Viceroy spoke. \"Another free planet lost to the Synchronized\n> Worlds, and one of our strongholds, too.\" He straightened, took a\n> shuddering breath. \"We must call an immediate war council, summon all\n> representatives.\" With a meaningful glance at Serena, he added, \"Let\n> us also include anyone who speaks for the Unallied Planets and wishes\n> to join us in this fight.\"\n>\n> *Everything in the universe contains flaws, ourselves included.

Inside her private chamber, Zufa Cenva lay\n> sweat-streaked on a pallet. She shrieked in pain, clenching her teeth,\n> her eyes glassy.\n>\n> Alone. No one dared come near a delirious Sorceress of Rossak.\n>\n> A metallic doorway curtain rattled with an invisible tele-kinetic\n> force. Wall shelves buckled in the aftershocks of Zufa's psychic\n> explosions, scattering pots and keepsakes all over the floor.\n>\n> Her long white hair was wild, quivering with internal energy.

She\n> cursed worthless Aurelius Venport.\n>\n> Zufa's spine shuddered, as if someone had jolted her with electricity.\n> Delicate ornamental objects floated into the air on invisible strings,\n> then flew in every direction, smashing into shards. One hollowed-out\n> irongourd stuffed with dried flowers burst into white flames,\n> crackling and smoking.\n>\n> She gasped as her body cramped, squeezing her abdominal muscles. It\n> seemed as if this unborn child wanted to kill her, to drag her down to\n> death before she could expel it from her uterus.\n>\n> Another failure! And she so desperately wanted to produce a true\n> daughter, a successor to lead her fellow Sorceresses to new heights of\n> mental power. The genetic index had misled her again.

Seeing the bright blood,\n> Venport bellowed for assistance, and two brave midwives scurried into\n> the chamber. One reached down with a towel, placing it over the fetus\n> like a shroud, while the other bathed Zufa's skin, adding pain-numbing\n> salves distilled from jungle spores.

She didn't care about the opinions of others anyway.\n> She only wanted to impress Tio Holtzman.\n>\n> Before Norma's departure from Rossak, her aloof mother had looked down\n> at her with dismissive puzzlement. Zufa chose to believe that the\n> brilliant Savant had made a mistake or had misread one of Norma's\n> theoretical papers.

A clean-shaven man with shoulder-length gray hair, Holtzman\n> appeared to be in his late middle years. His hands and fingernails\n> were clean, his clothing impeccable and ornamented with stylish\n> designs and badges.\n>\n> He greeted her with a broad smile and open arms that let the sleeves\n> of his white robe droop. \"Welcome to Poritrin, Miss Cenva.\" Holtzman\n> placed both hands on her shoulders in formal greeting. If he\n> experienced any disappointment upon seeing Norma's stature and coarse,\n> unattractive features, he did not show it. \"I certainly hope you've\n> brought your imagination with you.\" He gestured toward a doorway. \"We\n> have a lot of work to do together.\"\n>\n> He steered her through the spaceport crowds, away from their curious\n> stares, then took her away from Starda Spaceport in a private\n> limo-barge that floated high above the graceful Isana River.\n>\n> \"Poritrin is a peaceful world, where I can let my mind wander and\n> think of things that might save the human race.\" Holtzman smiled\n> proudly at her. \"I'm expecting that of you, too.\"\n>\n> \"I will do my best, Savant Holtzman.\"\n>\n> \"What more could any person ask?\"\n>\n> The skies of Poritrin held a gauze of clouds painted citrus yellow\n> with afternoon sunlight. The barge drifted above the multifingered\n> streamlets that wrapped around shifting islands and sandbars.\n> Traditional boats rode the current of the broad river, loaded with\n> grains and cargo for distribution\n>\n> in the port city and export offworld. Fertile Poritrin fed many\n> less-fortunate planets, in return for which they received raw\n> materials, equipment, manufactured goods, and human slaves to add to\n> their labor force.\n>\n> Some of the largest buildings in the spaceport were actually boats on\n> pontoons, anchored to the bases of sandstone bluffs. The roofs were\n> composed of layered shingles of silver-blue metal, smelted in mines\n> far to the north.\n>\n> He gestured to a bluff overlooking the crowded portions of blue-roofed\n> Starda, where she could recognize the influences of classic\n> Navachristian architecture. \"My laboratories are up there. Buildings\n> and supply sheds, quarters for my slaves and solvers, as well as my\n> own home--- everything built into that double spire of rock.\"\n>\n> The floating transport circled toward two sections of stone, like\n> adjacent fingers rising above the riverbed. She could see sheetplaz\n> windows, awning-covered balconies, and a walkway that linked a dome on\n> one spire with a conical stone tower and outbuildings on the other.\n>\n> Holtzman was pleased to note the amazement on her face. \"We have\n> quarters for you, Norma, in addition to private lab facilities and a\n> team of assistants to perform calculations based upon your theories. I\n> expect you to keep them all very busy.\"\n>\n> Norma looked at him, puzzled. \"Someone else to do the mathematics?\"\n>\n> \"Of course!\" Holtzman brushed iron-gray hair away from his face and\n> adjusted his white robe. \"You're an *idea* person, like me. We want\n> you to develop concepts, not bother with full-fledged implementation.\n> You should not waste time performing tedious arithmetic. Any\n> halfway-trained person can do that. It's what slaves are for.\"\n>\n> When the floating barge settled onto a glazed-tile deck, servants\n> emerged to take Norma's bags and offer the two of them cool drinks.\n> Like an eager boy, Holtzman led Norma to his impressive laboratories.\n> The large rooms were filled with water clocks and magnetic sculptures\n> in which spheres orbited\n>\n> about electrical paths without wires or gears. Sketches and\n> half-finished drawings covered electrostatic boards, surrounded by\n> serpentine calculations that went nowhere.\n>\n> Glancing around, Norma realized that Holtzman had abandoned more\n> concepts than she had ever created in her life. Even so, many of the\n> cluttered papers and geometric drawings looked a bit old. Some of the\n> ink had faded, and papers were curled around the edges.\n>\n> With a swish of his wide sleeves, Holtzman gave the intriguing items a\n> dismissive wave. \"Just toys, useless gadgets that I keep for my\n> amusement.\" He poked a finger at one of the floating silver balls,\n> which sent the other model planets into dangerous orbits, spinning\n> about like heavenly bodies out of control. \"Sometimes I dabble with\n> them for inspiration, but usually they only make me think of other\n> toys, not the weapons of mass destruction we need in order to save us\n> from the tyranny of machines.\"\n>\n> With a distracted frown, Holtzman continued, \"My work is constrained\n> in that I cannot use sophisticated computers. In order to perform the\n> enormous calculations required to test a theory, I have no recourse\n> but to rely upon human mental abilities and hope for the best from the\n> fallible calculational skills of trained people. Come, let me show you\n> the solvers.\"\n>\n> He led her to a well-illuminated chamber with high windows. Inside,\n> numerous identical benches and flat tabletops had been set up in a\n> grid layout. Workers hunched over each writing surface using handheld\n> calculation devices. From their drab garments and dull expressions,\n> Norma judged that these men and women must be some of Poritrin's\n> numerous slaves.\n>\n> \"This is the only way we can imitate the abilities of a thinking\n> machine,\" Holtzman explained. \"A computer can handle billions of\n> iterations. We have a harder time of it, yet with enough people\n> working in concert and as specialists, we accomplish billions of\n> calculations on our own. It just takes longer.\"\n>\n> He walked down the narrow aisles between the solvers, who were\n> furiously scribing numbers and mathematical symbols on flat slates,\n> checking and double-checking answers before passing them on to the\n> next person in line.\n>\n> \"Even the most complex math can be broken into a sequence of trivial\n> steps. Each of these slaves has been trained to complete specific\n> equations in an assembly-line fashion. When taken together, this\n> collective human mind is capable of remarkable feats.\" Holtzman\n> surveyed the room as if he expected his solvers to give him a\n> resounding cheer. Instead, they studied their work with heavy-lidded\n> eyes, moving through equation after equation with no comprehension of\n> reasons or larger pictures.\n>\n> Norma felt sympathy for them, having been belittled and ignored for so\n> long herself. She knew intellectually that human slavery was a way of\n> life on many League Worlds, as it was throughout the machine-ruled\n> planets. Nevertheless, she supposed that these workers would prefer\n> doing mental work to heavy labor out in the agricultural fields.\n>\n> With a magnanimous gesture, the scientist said, \"Every solver is at\n> your disposal, Norma, whenever you develop a theory that needs\n> verification. The next stage, of course is to build prototypes for\n> further testing and development. We have plenty of labs and test\n> facilities, but the most important work comes first.\" He tapped a\n> fingertip on his own forehead. *\"Up here.\"*\n>\n> Holtzman gave her a cockeyed grin and lowered his voice. \"Mistakes are\n> possible, of course, even at our level. If that happens, we hope that\n> Lord Niko Bludd is tolerant enough to keep us around.\"\n>\n> *Only those with narrow minds fail to see that the definition of\n> Impossible is 'Lack of imagination and incentive.'*\n>\n> --- SERENA BUTLER\n>\n> **I**n the front parlor of the Butler manor house, Xavier Harkonnen\n> shifted on a green brocaded settee. His duty uniform was not designed\n> for lounging in fine furniture. Ornate gold-framed paintings of Butler\n> ancestors adorned the walls, including one like a caricature of a\n> gentleman with a waxed handlebar mustache and a tricorner hat.\n>\n> Between tight duty shifts, he had rushed here to surprise Serena, and\n> the servants had asked him to wait. Blushing, Octa came into the\n> parlor, carrying a cool drink for him. Though he had always seen her\n> as Serena's little sister, Xavier realized with surprise that she was\n> actually a lovely young woman. With Serena's recent betrothal, Octa\n> might be dreaming of her own marriage, if she could ever overcome her\n> shy infatuation with him.\n>\n> \"Serena wasn't expecting you, but she'll be right out.\" Octa looked\n> away. \"She's in a meeting with official-looking men and women,\n> assistants carrying electronic equipment, a few Militia uniforms.\n> Something to do with her Parliament work, I think.\"\n>\n> Xavier gave a wan smile. \"We both have so many projects, but such\n> times demand it.\"\n>\n> While Octa occupied herself straightening books and statuettes on a\n> shelf, Xavier thought back to a Parliament session he had watched two\n> days before. Upset over the tragic fall of Giedi Prime, Serena had\n> tried to rally representatives from the strongest planets, hoping to\n> mount a rescue operation. She always wanted to *do* something; it was\n> one of the reasons Xavier loved her so much. While others accepted the\n> defeat and cringed in fear that Omnius would push for more conquests,\n> Serena wanted to charge in and save the world. Any world.\n>\n> Dressed in a long gown, she had spoken passionately in the temporary\n> Hall of Parliament. \"We can't just give up on Giedi Prime! The\n> thinking machines have penetrated the scrambler shields, killed the\n> Magnus, enslaved the people, and every day their presence grows\n> stronger. There have to be Home Guard survivors fighting behind the\n> machine lines, and we know that another shield-generator station was\n> nearly completed. Perhaps that can be made functional! We must fight\n> back before the thinking machines can establish their own\n> infrastructure. If we wait, they will become unassailable!\"\n>\n> \"As far as we know, they are already unassailable,\" grumbled the\n> representative from industrial Vertree Colony.\n>\n> The Zanbar official added, \"Bringing the Armada to Giedi Prime would\n> be suicide. Without their scrambler shields, they have no defenses\n> left, and the machines would slaughter us in a direct conflict.\"\n>\n> Serena had jabbed a finger at the nervous audience. \"Not necessarily.\n> If we could slip in and finish the work at the secondary\n> shield-generating complex, then project a new blanket of disruptor\n> fields, we could cut off---\"\n>\n> The League members had actually laughed at the suggestion. Seeing her\n> heartbroken expression, Xavier felt stung on Serena's behalf. But she\n> had not understood the difficulty of her na\u00efve suggestion, the\n> impossibility of restoring Giedi Prime's shields under the noses of\n> the machine conquerors. During his planetary inspection tour, Xavier\n> had learned that it could take days or weeks for engineers--- working\n> under the best of conditions--- to make the backup shield system\n> operational.\n>\n> But Serena never stopped trying. The ache of imagining so many\n> suffering humans drove her to it.\n>\n> The vote had gone overwhelmingly against her. \"We cannot spend the\n> resources, firepower, or personnel on an ill-advised mission to a\n> planet we have already lost. It is now a machine stronghold.\" The\n> nobles feared for their own local defenses.\n>\n> Such work occupied most of Xavier's time. As an Armada officer, he had\n> gone to extended sessions with officers and Parliament\n> representatives, including Viceroy Butler. Xavier was determined to\n> learn what had gone wrong with Giedi Prime's defenses--- and whether\n> he was to blame in some way.\n>\n> Armada tacticians had studied the inspection records and assured him\n> that he could have done nothing to prevent the takeover, short of\n> stationing a full fleet of battleships at every League World. If\n> Omnius was willing to sacrifice part of his robotic attack force to\n> bring down Holtzman's scrambler shields, no planet was safe. But the\n> information didn't make Xavier feel much better.\n>\n> On Poritrin, Tio Holtzman was working hard to improve the scrambler\n> system design. Lord Bludd expressed his optimism and confidence in the\n> Savant, especially since the inventor had brought in another\n> mathematician, the daughter of the Sorceress Zufa Cenva, to assist\n> him. Xavier hoped something could be done quickly enough to make a\n> difference. . . .\n>\n> Lovely but harried, Serena entered the parlor and hugged him. \"I had\n> no idea you were coming.\" Octa slipped out the side door.\n>\n> Xavier looked at the ornate clock on the mantel. \"I wanted to surprise\n> you, but I have to get back to duty. I have a long meeting this\n> afternoon.\"\n>\n> She nodded, preoccupied. \"Since the attack on Giedi Prime, we've all\n> been prisoners of our planning sessions. I think I've lost track of\n> how many committees I serve.\"\n>\n> Teasingly, he said, \"Should I have been invited to this mysterious\n> gathering?\"\n>\n> Her chuckle sounded forced. \"Oh? The League Armada doesn't give you\n> enough work, so you'd like to sit in on my tedious meetings as well?\n> Perhaps I should speak to your new commander.\"\n>\n> \"No thank you, my dear. I'd rather fight ten cymeks than try to\n> dissuade you when you've set your mind to something.\" Serena responded\n> to his kiss with surprising passion. He stepped back, breathing hard,\n> and straightened his uniform. \"I need to go.\"\n>\n> \"Can I make it up to you at dinner tonight? A little t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, just\n> the two of us?\" Her eyes sparkled. \"It's important to me, especially\n> now.\"\n>\n> \"I'll be there.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WITH A SIGH of relief after quelling Xavier's suspicions, Serena\n> returned to the Winter Sun Room where her team had gathered. She wiped\n> a sparkle of sweat from her forehead. Several faces turned toward her,\n> and she raised a hand to allay concerns.\n>\n> Late morning sunlight splashed across the chairs, the tile counters\n> and a breakfast table now strewn with plans, maps, and resource\n> charts. \"We've got to get back to work,\" said the grizzled veteran Ort\n> Wibsen. \"Don't have much time if you want to put this in motion.\"\n>\n> \"That is absolutely my intention, Commander Wibsen. Anybody with\n> doubts should have left us days ago.\"\n>\n> Serena's father believed that she spent her mornings in the bright,\n> cheery room just reading, but for weeks she had been exploring schemes\n> . . .\n>\n> gathering volunteers, expert personnel, and raw materials. No one\n> could stop Serena Butler from devoting her energies to humanitarian\n> work.\n>\n> \"I tried to follow proper channels and make the League take action,\"\n> she said, \"but sometimes people must be coerced into making the right\n> decision. They must be led to it, like a stubborn Salusan stallion.\"\n>\n> After the Parliament laughed at her \"na\u00efve foolishness,\" Serena had\n> marched out of the temporary meeting hall but did not accept defeat.\n> She\n>\n> decided to change tactics, even if she had to organize and finance a\n> mission herself.\n>\n> When Xavier learned of her plan, after it was too late to stop her,\n> she hoped he would be proud of her.\n>\n> Now she studied the team she had gathered from the Armada's most\n> overlooked experts in commando operations: captains, supply runners,\n> even infiltration specialists. Ten men and women turned to look at\n> her. She clicked a remote control switch to close the overhead\n> louvers. The brightness of the room diminished, though muted sunlight\n> continued to filter in.\n>\n> \"If we can reclaim Giedi Prime, it will be twice the moral victory\n> that the machines had,\" Serena said. \"We will show that they cannot\n> hold us.\"\n>\n> Wibsen looked as if he had never ceased fighting, though he had been\n> off active duty for over a decade. \"All of us are more than happy to\n> tackle a task that will have tangible results. I've been itching to\n> strike a blow against the damned machines.\"\n>\n> Ort Wibsen was an old space commander who had been forced to retire---\n> ostensibly because of his age. More likely it had to do with his\n> coarse personality, a penchant for arguing with superiors, and history\n> of ignoring the details of orders. In spite of his surliness he was\n> exactly the man Serena needed to lead a mission that other League\n> members would have declared insane, or at least unwise.\n>\n> \"Then this is your chance, Commander,\" she said.\n>\n> Pinquer Jibb, the curly-haired and still-haggard-looking messenger who\n> had fled the conquest of Giedi Prime to deliver his terrible news, sat\n> stiff-backed, looking around the room. \"I've provided you with all the\n> background material you need. I've compiled detailed reports. The\n> subsidiary shield-generator station was nearly finished when the\n> machines attacked the planet. We merely need to slip in and get it\n> running.\" His haunted eyes grew fiery. \"Plenty members of the Giedi\n> Home Guard must\n>\n> have survived. They'll be doing everything they can behind enemy\n> lines, but that won't be enough unless we help them.\"\n>\n> \"If we can get the secondary shield generators functional, the cymeks\n> and robots on the surface will fall to a concerted defense from the\n> Armada.\" She scanned the others in the room. \"Do you think we'll be\n> able to do that?\"\n>\n> Brigit Paterson, a masculine-looking woman, frowned. \"What makes you\n> think the Armada will join the fight? After my engineers get the job\n> done, how will we make sure the military comes in to save our butts?\"\n>\n> Serena gave her a grim smile. \"You leave that to me.\"\n>\n> Serena had been raised with the best schools and tutors, groomed to\n> become a leader. With so much that needed to be done, she could not\n> sit in a comfortable manor house and fail to use the Butler wealth and\n> power.\n>\n> Now she was about to put that determination to the test. \"Commander\n> Wibsen, do you have the information I requested?\"\n>\n> With his deeply creased face and rough voice, the veteran seemed more\n> like a man of the outdoors than an intricate strategist. But no one in\n> Zimia knew more about military operations than he did.\n>\n> \"Some of it's good, some of it's bad. After crushing the government in\n> Giedi City, the machines kept a robot fleet in orbit. Mop-up work on\n> the ground is being led by one Titan and a lot of neo-cymeks.\" He\n> coughed, scowled, and adjusted a medication dispenser implanted in his\n> sternum.\n>\n> \"Omnius can keep sending in more machines, or even manufacture\n> reinforcements using the captured industries of Giedi Prime,\" said\n> Pinquer Jibb, his voice urgent. \"Unless we get the secondary shield\n> complex working.\"\n>\n> \"Then that's what we have to do,\" Serena said. \"The Home Guard was\n> dispersed across the settled continent, and many of the outlying\n> regiments\n>\n> seem to have gone underground to form a fifth column. If we can\n> contact them, organize them, we might be able to damage the machine\n> conquerors.\"\n>\n> \"I can help with that,\" Jibb insisted. \"It's our only chance.\"\n>\n> \"I still think it's foolhardy,\" Wibsen said. \"But what the hell. I\n> didn't say I wasn't going to go.\"\n>\n> \"Is the ship ready?\" Serena asked, impatient.\n>\n> \"It is, but there's a great deal lacking in this operation, if you ask\n> me.\"\n>\n> Brigit Paterson said to Serena, \"I have secured detailed maps, plans,\n> and blueprints of all aspects of Giedi Prime and Giedi City, including\n> full functional diagrams of the subsidiary scrambler-shield\n> generators.\" She extended a stack of thin film sheets densely packed\n> with information. \"Pinquer says they're up to date.\"\n>\n> With boundless enthusiasm and passion, Serena had always demonstrated\n> skill in putting things together. Two years ago, she had led a relief\n> team to Caladan, an Unallied Planet where thousands of refugees from\n> the Synchronized Worlds had fled. On her most recent crusade, a year\n> ago, she had delivered three space transports full of medical supplies\n> to closed-off Tlulax, where the inhabitants were suffering from\n> mysterious diseases. Now that Tlulaxa flesh merchants had provided\n> medical aid and replacement organs from their biological tanks---\n> including saving her beloved Xavier--- she felt that her investment in\n> effort had paid off fully.\n>\n> Now Serena had called in favors, resulting in a mission that bore some\n> similiarities to her earlier successful efforts. She expected another\n> clear success, despite the dangers.\n>\n> With beatific confidence, Serena looked around the table again. She\n> envisioned the mission succeeding. Eleven people willing to challenge\n> a set of conquerors and overcome the odds. \"We have no higher\n> priorities.\"\n>\n> Ort Wibsen had worked between traditional channels to obtain a fast\n> blockade runner. Paterson's engineering crew had equipped the vessel\n> with the best experimental materials she could scavenge from weapons\n> manufactories. Using personal accounts and falsified documentation,\n> Serena had funded whatever the old commander needed. She wanted the\n> best possible chance for her impetuous mission to succeed.\n>\n> Serena said, \"Every person in the League has lost someone to the\n> thinking-machine onslaught, and now we're going to do something about\n> it.\"\n>\n> \"Let's get busy then,\" Pinquer Jibb said. \"Time for payback.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> THAT EVENING, ALONE in the grand dining hall, Serena and Xavier sat\n> across from each another. Servers bustled back and forth in\n> red-and-gold jackets and black trousers.\n>\n> As he sampled golden duckling fillets on his plate, Xavier talked\n> excitedly about Armada mobilization plans and methods of protecting\n> the League Worlds.\n>\n> \"Let's not talk business tonight.\" With a charming smile, Serena rose\n> to her feet and glided around the table, taking a seat next to him,\n> very close. \"I savor each moment with you, Xavier,\" she said, giving\n> nothing away about her plan.\n>\n> He smiled back at her. \"After the poison gas, I can't savor much else.\n> But you, Serena, are better than the finest banquet or the sweetest\n> perfume.\"\n>\n> Stroking his cheek, she said, \"I think we should tell the servants to\n> go to their quarters. My father is in the city and my sister is gone\n> for the evening. Should we waste this time alone?\"\n>\n> He reached out to brush her arm, then drew her close and grinned. \"I'm\n> not hungry anyway.\"\n>\n> \"I am.\" Passionately, she kissed his ear, then his cheek, finally\n> finding his mouth. He ran his fingers through her hair, touching the\n> back of her head and kissing her more deeply.\n>\n> They left the remnants of the fine meal on the table. She took his\n> hand and together they hurried to her chambers. The door was heavy,\n> and locked easily. She already had a fire lit in the fireplace, giving\n> the room an orange, cheery glow. They kissed again and again, trying\n> to unfasten laces and buttons and clips without breaking apart from\n> each other.\n>\n> Serena could barely control her urgency, not just to feel his intimate\n> touch, but to etch every sensation into her mind. He did not know that\n> she intended to slip away afterward, and she needed something to\n> remember about this night, to compensate for the time they would be\n> apart.\n>\n> His fingers were like fire as they traced down her naked back. She\n> could think of nothing but the moment as she pulled off his shirt.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WITH THE MEMORY of her lover's embrace still tingling along the nerves\n> of her body, Serena left the sleeping manor. She set out into the\n> quiet depths of night, bound to rendezvous with her team at a private\n> field on the outskirts of the Zimia spaceport.\n>\n> Anxious to be away, her optimism subduing her anxiety, Serena joined\n> her ten commando volunteers. Within the hour they departed in a fast,\n> cloud-gray blockade runner loaded with engineering tools, weapons, and\n> hope.\n>\n> *Religion, time and time again, brings down empires, rotting them from\n> within.*\n>\n> --- IBLIS GINJO,\n\nrearly planning for the Jihad\n\n> **T**he conquered planet Earth seemed to be a dumping ground for\n> grandiose monuments that celebrated the fictitious glories of the\n> Titans.\n>\n> Gazing from his vantage at yet another huge construction project\n> designed by the prideful imaginations of the cymeks, the crew leader\n> paced along a high wooden platform. His people were good workers,\n> dedicated to him--- but the work itself seemed pointless. When this\n> ornate pedestal was completed and shored up with reinforced arcs, it\n> would become the platform for a colossal statue representing the\n> idealized, long-lost human form of the Titan Ajax.\n>\n> As one of the most successful trustee humans on Earth, Iblis Ginjo\n> took his job very seriously. He scrutinized the throng of slaves\n> scurrying about below. He had convinced them to be enthusiastic,\n> drumming up their attentiveness through well-chosen phrases and\n> rewards . . . though Iblis hated to waste such loyalty and hard work\n> on a brutal bully such as Ajax.\n>\n> Still, every person had his part in the giant machine of civilization.\n> Iblis had to make sure there were no malfunctions, not on his watch.\n>\n> The crew leader was not required to be here; his subordinate trustees\n> could just as easily stand under the hot sun and supervise. But Iblis\n> preferred this to his other duties. Seeing him watch over them, the\n> slaves seemed to add a bit more to the tasks. He took pride in what\n> they could accomplish, if managed well, and they genuinely wanted to\n> please him.\n>\n> Otherwise, he would spend tedious hours involved in the processing of\n> new slaves and assigning them to various work crews. Often the\n> un-tamed ones\n>\n> needed special training, or resisted violently--- problems that\n> hindered the smooth flow of daily work.\n>\n> Erasmus, the strangely independent and eccentric robot, had recently\n> issued an order to inspect any *hrethgir* captives taken from newly\n> conquered Giedi Prime, in particular any human who showed qualities of\n> independence and leadership. Iblis would stay on the alert for a\n> suitable candidate . . . without drawing attention to himself.\n>\n> He didn't care about Omnius's goals for their own sake, but as a crew\n> leader he received certain considerations based on performance. Though\n> such perks made life tolerable, he distributed most of the rewards\n> among his crews.\n>\n> With a broad face and thick hair that fell across his brow, Iblis had\n> a strong, virile appearance. Able to get more work out of the slaves\n> than any other boss, he knew the best tools and incentives, the\n> manipulation of gentle promises rather than harsh threats. Food, rest\n> days, sexual services from the reproductive slaves--- whatever it took\n> to motivate them. He had even been asked to speak some of his thoughts\n> at the school for trustees, but his techniques were not widely adopted\n> among the other privileged humans.\n>\n> Most crew bosses relied on deprivation and torture, but Iblis\n> considered that a waste. He had risen to his position largely through\n> the force of his personality and the allegiance he engendered in his\n> slaves. Even difficult men invariably succumbed to his will. The\n> machines sensed this innate ability, so Omnius gave him the freedom to\n> do his work.\n>\n> At a glance, Iblis counted half a dozen monoliths around the hilltop\n> Forum, each pedestal containing the huge statue of one of the Twenty\n> Titans, beginning with Tlaloc, then Agamemnon, then Juno, Barbarossa,\n> Tamerlane, and Alexander. An immense likeness of Ajax would occupy the\n> one here, not because Ajax was so important, but because he was\n> violently impatient. Dante could wait, and Xerxes.\n>\n> Iblis couldn't remember the rest of the Titans off the top of his\n> head, but he always learned more than he wanted to know as each statue\n> was built. The\n>\n> work would never end. Iblis had been personally involved in every one\n> of the ostentatious sculptures over the past five years, first as a\n> construction slave and later as crew boss.\n>\n> It was late in the summer season, warmer than usual. Heat devils\n> danced off rooftops around the Forum. Directly under him on the dusty\n> ground, his construction crew wore drab browns, grays, and blacks---\n> durable clothing that required only occasional washing or repairs.\n>\n> Below Iblis's platform, a team boss bellowed out orders. Supervisory\n> robots moved about, making no move to assist the straining laborers.\n> Watcheyes floated overhead, recording everything for Omnius. Iblis\n> hardly noticed them anymore. Humans were industrious, ingenious,\n> and--- unlike machines--- flexible, as long as they were given\n> incentives and rewards, encouraged in the proper ways, guided to the\n> best behavior. The thinking machines could not understand the\n> subtleties, but Iblis knew that each minor reward he gave his workers\n> was an investment that paid off tenfold.\n>\n> According to tradition, the slaves often sang work songs and engaged\n> in boisterous team competitions; they were silent now, groaning as\n> they hauled structural blocks into place though in their habitation\n> hives, workers sometimes grumbled about the labor. The cymeks were\n> anxious to see the pedestal completed so they could erect the statue\n> of Ajax, which was being fabricated elsewhere by another crew. Each\n> segment of the project followed a rigid schedule, with no excuses\n> permitted for lateness or shoddy quality.\n>\n> For now, Iblis was glad his people could work in peace, without the\n> intimidating scrutiny of Ajax. Iblis did not know where the Titan\n> might be at the moment, but could only hope he would prey on other\n> hapless individuals today. Iblis had work to do and a schedule to\n> keep.\n>\n> In his opinion, the monoliths were useless--- huge obelisks, pillars,\n> statues, and Grogyptian facades for empty, unnecessary buildings. But\n> it was not his position to question such time-consuming projects.\n> Iblis knew full well that the monuments fulfilled an important\n> psychological need for the usurped\n>\n> tyrants. Besides, such work kept slaves busy and gave them visible\n> results of their labor.\n>\n> Following their humiliating overthrow by Omnius centuries ago, the\n> Titans had constantly scrambled to recover lost status. Iblis thought\n> the cymeks went overboard, building cyclopean statues and pyramids\n> just to make themselves feel more important. They strutted around in\n> showy but old-fashioned machine bodies, bragging about military\n> conquests.\n>\n> Iblis wondered how much of it was really true. After all, how could\n> anyone question those who controlled history? The wild humans in the\n> unruly League worlds probably had a different view of the conquests.\n>\n> He wiped sweat from his brow and smelled the gritty dust that rose\n> from the work below. He looked at the electronic notepad in his hand,\n> checking the progress against the schedule tally. Everything was\n> proceeding well, as expected.\n>\n> With his sharp eyes, he spotted a man leaning against a shaded wall,\n> taking an unauthorized rest. With a smile, Iblis pointed an\n> \"encourager\" pulse weapon at him and skimmed the man's left leg with a\n> beam of energy. The slave slapped the hot spot on his skin and whirled\n> to look up at Iblis.\n>\n> \"Are you trying to make me look bad?\" Iblis yelled. \"What if Ajax came\n> around and saw you falling asleep there? Would he kill you first, or\n> me?\"\n>\n> Abashed, the man shouldered his way into the crowd of sweating\n> laborers, where he resumed his work with renewed vigor.\n>\n> Some work bosses found it necessary to kill slaves as examples to the\n> others, but Iblis had never resorted to that tactic and vowed that he\n> never would. He was certain it would break the inexplicable spell he\n> had over the men. Instead, he only had to show disappointment in them,\n> and they worked harder.\n>\n> Every few days he delivered stirring, impromptu speeches. On such\n> occasions the slaves received water and rest breaks, giving them\n> renewed\n>\n> energy that more than made up for the time spent. The way he strung\n> phrases together often brought cheers and enthusiasm, and only a few\n> questions from bold slaves who wondered why they should be excited\n> about yet another monument. The work leader's talent lay in being\n> utterly *convincing*.\n>\n> Iblis hated the machine overlords, but concealed his feelings so\n> effectively that his superiors actually trusted him. Now, in a\n> fanciful moment, he envisioned destroying the computer evermind and\n> installing himself in its place. Much more than a mere trustee. Think\n> of it--- Iblis Ginjo, ruler of all, knower of all!\n>\n> He caught himself and dispelled the foolish daydream. Reality was a\n> harsh teacher, like the sight of a cymek on a beautiful day. If Iblis\n> didn't complete the obelisk pedestal in time, Ajax would devise an\n> extravagant punishment for them all.\n>\n> The work leader didn't dare fall behind schedule.\n\n*Each of us influences the actions of the people we know.*\n\n--- XAVIER HARKONNEN,\n\ncomment to his men\n\n> **F**or days, Tercero Xavier Harkonnen stayed up late working on\n> defensive plans for the League. Since his sweet night with Serena--- a\n> sparkling promise of their future--- he had devoted himself to the\n> protection of free humanity.\n>\n> On Salusa he flew practice missions, drilled new fighters, increased\n> the number of picket ships on the system's perimeter for a stronger\n> first defense, and extended the scanning network to provide a better\n> early-warning capability from deep space. Engineers and scientists\n> dismantled and studied the warrior-forms abandoned by the cymeks and\n> left behind in the ruins of Zimia, hoping to find flaws or weaknesses.\n> With each breath in his replacement lungs, he felt outrage against the\n> thinking machines.\n>\n> He wanted to spend more time with Serena, dreaming of where they would\n> go after the wedding, but driven by anger and private guilt about\n> Giedi Prime, Xavier buried himself in work. If he had concentrated on\n> the primary mission there, rather than mooning like a lovesick\n> schoolboy, he might have noticed the defensive flaw and helped the\n> Magnus to prepare. Even encouraging the immediate completion of the\n> secondary shield generator would have made all the difference. But it\n> was too late now.\n>\n> Seemingly inconsequential mistakes could lead to huge events. Xavier\n> promised himself that he would never lapse in his duties again, not\n> for any reason. If that meant spending less time with Serena, she\n> would understand.\n>\n> Emergency staff meetings resulted in a revision of the military\n> structure of the Armada, combining the resources and numerous warship\n> designs from all the planetary militias and home guards. The special\n> defensive needs and tactical significance of each League World were\n> discussed in detail.\n>\n> Armada recruitment surged to new levels. Manufactories worked overtime\n> to provide ships and weapons.\n>\n> Xavier hoped it would be enough.\n>\n> In his office on the top floor of the Joint Staff Building, electronic\n> star maps covered the walls. Printed charts and reports cluttered\n> every work surface. Each step of the way, he obtained the approval of\n> the Joint Staff Commander, who in turn reviewed key elements with\n> Viceroy Butler.\n>\n> When he slept at all, Xavier did so in his office or in the\n> underground barracks. For days he did not return home to the Tantor\n> estate, though his mother often sent eager young Vergyl to deliver\n> meals made especially for him.\n>\n> Oddly, he had not heard from Serena, and assumed the Viceroy's\n> daughter was occupied with vital duties of her own. The two young\n> lovers were alike in their ability to see large-scale priorities . . .\n> and in their independence.\n>\n> Determined to revamp League defenses, Xavier kept himself going with\n> stimulant capsules and drinks. He rarely noted what time of day or\n> night it was, heeding only the next meeting on his schedule. Now he\n> blinked through his office window at the quiet streets and the city\n> lights glittering in the darkness. How long had it been night time?\n> The hours merged with each other, carrying him along like a pebble in\n> a landslide.\n>\n> In the final tally, how much could one man actually accomplish? Were\n> some League Worlds already doomed, no matter what he did? Because of\n> the distances between planets and slow space travel, communication was\n> sluggish, and news was often stale by the time it reached Salusa\n> Secundus.\n>\n> His reliance on stimulants made him feel scratchy and ragged. He was\n> awake, but so pummeled by fatigue that he could no longer focus. He\n> heaved a huge sigh, staring blankly. At the side of the office, his\n> adjutant, Cuarto Jaymes Powder, had cleared a spot on a table and\n> rested his head on the polished wood.\n>\n> When the door opened, Cuarto Powder did not stir, or even snore, but\n> continued sleeping like the dead. Xavier was surprised to see Viceroy\n> Butler stride in, also weary to the core. \"We need to implement\n> whatever you've got ready, Xavier. Funding is guaranteed. For the sake\n> of morale, the people must *see* us doing something.\"\n>\n> \"I know, but we need more than one solution, sir. Have Lord Bludd\n> encourage Savant Holtzman to present any preliminary concepts he has\n> under development.\" He rubbed his eyes. \"If nothing else, we need new\n> options for our arsenal.\"\n>\n> \"We already talked about that last night, Xavier--- at great length.\"\n> The Viceroy looked at him strangely. \"Don't you remember? He has\n> several prototype units almost ready.\"\n>\n> \"Yes . . . of course. I was just reminding you.\"\n>\n> Xavier crossed the room and sat at an interactive information screen,\n> a high-security system that flirted with the dangers of a computer.\n> The electronic summary system could organize and provide vital data,\n> but had no self-awareness. Many nobles--- especially Bludd of\n> Poritrin--- resented the use of even such crude computers, but in\n> times such as these, the summary systems were vital.\n>\n> Passing his hand over the screen, Xavier made adjustments in his\n> report to Parliament, including a compendium of planet-specific\n> appendices, then printed the document, copies of which would be sent\n> to each League World. Presently he handed a neat stack to the Viceroy,\n> who perused the recommendations and signed his approval with a\n> flourish. Then Serena's father hurried out of the office, leaving the\n> door open behind him.\n>\n> At the table, Cuarto Powder stirred and sat up, bleary-eyed. Without a\n> word, Xavier settled into the chair at his own desk. Across the room,\n> the summary screen flashed in an aurora of light as technicians filled\n> it with probing signals to make certain the system exhibited no glints\n> of artificial intelligence.\n>\n> As his aide drifted off again, Xavier dozed as well. In his groggy\n> imagination he dreamed that Serena Butler was missing, along with a\n> ship and military team. It seemed surreal to him, but plausible . . .\n> then he realized with a start that he was not asleep at all anymore.\n>\n> Powder stood at his desk with another officer, listening to the bad\n> news. \"She's taken a blockade-runner, sir! Modified it with expensive\n> armor and weaponry. She has a group of commandos with her. An old\n> veteran, Ort Wibsen, agreed to lead them.\"\n>\n> Xavier struggled to throw off the confusion induced by weariness.\n> After rubbing his scratchy eyes he was surprised to see Serena's\n> wide-eyed sister Octa standing behind the men. In a pale hand she held\n> a gleaming black diamond necklace dangling from a coil of gold, which\n> she hurriedly handed to him.\n>\n> \"Serena told me to wait five days, and then give this to you.\" Octa\n> seemed ethereal, delicate; she moved to his side, but would not meet\n> his gaze.\n>\n> Searching for answers, Xavier removed the necklace from the coil. When\n> he touched the black diamonds, the perspiration on his hand activated\n> a tiny projector that showed a small holo image of Serena. He stared\n> at her, feeling astonishment and dread. The visual seemed to look\n> directly at him.\n>\n> \"Xavier, my love, I have gone to Giedi Prime. The League would have\n> argued the issue for months, while the conquered people suffer. I\n> can't permit that.\" Her smile was heartbreaking, but hopeful. \"I have\n> a team of the best engineers, commandos, and infiltration specialists.\n> We have all the equipment and expertise we need to slip in and\n> activate the secondary shield transmitter. We will complete the\n> construction and install the systems\n>\n> --- enabling us to cut off the planet from thinking machine ships,\n> while trapping the ones that are already there on the surface. You\n> must bring in the Armada and recapture this world. We're counting on\n> you. Think of how much we can help humanity!\"\n>\n> Xavier was unable to believe what he was hearing. The image of Serena\n> continued to speak her recorded message. \"I will be waiting there,\n> Xavier. I\n>\n> know you won't let me down.\"\n>\n> Xavier clenched his hands until his knuckles whitened. If anyone could\n> accomplish such a surprising mission, it was Serena Butler. She was\n> impetuous, but at least she was trying to do something. And she knew\n> her decision would force the rest of them to act.\n>\n> Octa began crying softly at his side. Viceroy Butler rushed into the\n> office, appalled at what he had heard.\n>\n> \"That's just like her,\" Xavier said. \"Now we have to rally a\n> response--- there's no choice.\"\n>\n> *Think of war as behavior.*\n\n--- GENERAL AGAMEMNON,\n\n*Memoirs*\n\n> **I**n an arena under the harsh sunlight of Earth's equatorial zone,\n> Agamemnon prepared to battle Omnius's gladiator machine. The evermind\n> treated these mock combats as challenges for the subservient Titans, a\n> way for them to vent their anger and keep them preoccupied. But\n> Agamemnon saw it as an opportunity to strike hard against his real\n> enemy.\n>\n> Two hundred and thirty years ago, human slaves and contractor robots\n> had completed this semicircular, open-roofed coliseum for Omnius's\n> flashy battles. The evermind enjoyed testing the destructive\n> capabilities of different robotic designs. Here, armored vehicles and\n> self-aware artillery systems could clash under controlled\n> circumstances.\n>\n> Long ago, the genius Barbarossa had programmed an appreciation for\n> combat and a thirst for conquest into the artificial intelligence that\n> had evolved into Omnius. Even a thousand years later the computer\n> evermind had never forgotten his taste for victory.\n>\n> Sometimes these staged competitions pitted humans against machines.\n> Randomly selected slaves from work gangs were given clubs, explosives,\n> or cutting beams and thrown into the arena to face combat robots. The\n> irrational violence of desperate humans never ceased to challenge the\n> calculating mind of Omnius. At other times, the omnipresent computer\n> preferred to demonstrate his own superiority against his cymeks.\n>\n> In anticipation of the next gladiatorial challenge, Agamemnon had\n> spent considerable effort in designing his new combat body. Omnius\n> sometimes pitted his sleekest, most sophisticated models against the\n> Titans; on other occasions, he responded with absurdly massive\n> monstrosities that would never have been viable in any real struggle.\n> It was all for show.\n>\n> Months ago, when Barbarossa had achieved a particularly fine victory\n> against Omnius, the cymek had demanded permission to attack the feral\n> humans as a reward. While the strike on Salusa Secundus had not gone\n> well, the Titans' second effort had conquered Giedi Prime. Barbarossa\n> was even now overseeing dozens of neo-cymeks in the subjugation of the\n> people there, a Titan once more in charge of a world. At last, it was\n> a step in the right direction . . .\n>\n> If he succeeded in winning in the arena today, Agamemnon had plans of\n> his own.\n>\n> With sirens blaring to announce the new event, Agamemnon rolled\n> forward on resilient walker pads and passed between the Corinthian\n> columns of Challenger's Gate. He could feel the thrumming strength of\n> his stepped-up mobility systems, the pulse of increased power surging\n> through his neurelectric pathways.\n>\n> Inside this gladiator-form, his low-slung body core consisted of a\n> pair of reinforced spheres--- one surrounded by opaque armor, the\n> other made of transparent alloyglas. Within the clear globe hung the\n> grayish white hemispheres of his human brain, drifting in a pale-blue\n> electrafluid and connected to thoughtrodes. Faint photon discharges\n> crackled along the cerebral lobes as the cymek body moved forward,\n> ready to fight.\n>\n> Around the double-sphere core, bulky drive motors hummed inside\n> protective cowlings. Engines worked the smooth hydraulics of four\n> grappling legs. Each articulated limb ended with a shifting mass of\n> adaptable metal polymer that could shape itself into a variety of\n> hardened weapons.\n>\n> Agamemnon had constructed this ferocious gladiator-form under the\n> buzzing gaze of watcheyes that monitored his every move. Omnius\n> supposedly filed all such information in a segregated portion of his\n> evermind, so as not to gain an unfair combat advantage. Or so Omnius\n> claimed.\n>\n> While Agamemnon waited, poised for battle, his opponent strode\n> forward, controlled directly by the evermind. Omnius had selected a\n> walking suit of exaggerated medieval armor: two massive legs with feet\n> like the foundations of a building and arms that ended in gauntleted\n> fists as large as the body core itself. The proportions were grossly\n> exaggerated, like a child's nightmare of a bully. Spikes extruded from\n> the massive knuckles on Omnius's goliath robot, and apocalyptic\n> discharges arced from point to point on the thorny fist.\n>\n> Agamemnon pushed forward on armored walker pads while raising his\n> crablike forelimbs, the adaptable-polymer ends of each morphing into\n> claws. Even if he won the contest today, the evermind would suffer\n> nothing, would not even have the grace to be humiliated in defeat.\n>\n> On the other hand, Omnius could accidentally destroy the Titan's brain\n> canister. Unforseen things happened in battle situations, and maybe\n> Omnius\n>\n> --- despite his programming that prevented him from intentionally\n> killing a Titan--- was counting on that. For Agamemnon, this fight was\n> for real.\n>\n> A few designated robotic observers watched from the stands through\n> enhanced optic threads, but they remained silent. Agamemnon did not\n> require applause anyway. The other polished stone seats in the\n> coliseum remained empty, reflecting daylight from the open sky. The\n> large stadium, like an echoing tomb, had all the room necessary for\n> two gigantic foes to clash.\n>\n> No announcement preceded the fight, no information piped over\n> loudspeakers. Agamemnon launched his attack first.\n>\n> The Titan raised his whiplike grappling arms, hardened them with a\n> shifting diamond film, and drove forward on heavy walker pads. With\n> surprising agility, Omnius's goliath robot lifted an enormous leg and\n> sidestepped the attack.\n>\n> Agamemnon lunged with another of his forelimbs, this one capped with a\n> spherical wrecking ball that fired disruptive, paralyzing energy. The\n> pulse thrummed through vulnerable systems, and Omnius's warrior\n> shuddered.\n>\n> Suddenly the goliath swiveled, raising a gauntleted fist to smash the\n> cymek's segmented arm. Even the diamond film could not endure the\n> blow, which bent Agamemnon's forelimb until it ripped from the\n> flexible socket. The cymek dismissed the damage and reversed his\n> walker pads, ejecting the unsalvageable limb. He swung up a cutting\n> arm that metamorphosed into a flurry of shimmering diamond blades.\n>\n> Agamemnon sawed through his opponent's armored torso, severing a set\n> of neurelectric control threads. Greenish fluid sprayed out from\n> chopped lubricant channels. The combat goliath swung his other spiked\n> fist, but Agamemnon danced his walker pads sideways and shifted his\n> vulnerable body core, keeping the brain canister safe.\n>\n> When his swing missed completely, the heavy blow overbalanced the\n> gladiator robot. Agamemnon brought up two slicing arms, hacking at the\n> goliath's arm joints with white-hot cutting irons. He found vulnerable\n> spots with surprising ease, and the goliath's right arm dangled\n> useless, a tangle of neurelectric fibers and conductive fluids.\n>\n> To assess the damage, Omnius dragged his unwieldy fighter two\n> thundering steps backward. Agamemnon pressed his advantage, closing to\n> grappling distance. Then he unleashed his first major surprise.\n>\n> From a concealed compartment within the old-fashioned engine housing,\n> a trapdoor irised open, and eight reinforced conductor-fiber cables\n> sprang out, each tipped with a magnetic connector claw. The cables\n> flew like a nest of startled vipers and slammed into the reeling\n> goliath. As soon as the tips struck home, Agamemnon released a huge\n> energy discharge. Lightning flared up and down the massive body of\n> Omnius's fighter.\n>\n> The cymek general expected this insidious blow to knock the combat\n> robot completely offline, but Omnius must have shielded his fighting\n> unit well. Agamemnon sent another paralytic pulse like a scorpion's\n> sting, but still the Omnius gladiator did not fall. Instead, as if in\n> anger, the machine swung its mammoth gauntlet with the force of a\n> colliding train, putting all of his energy and momentum behind a\n> single blow.\n>\n> The spiked fist struck true, slamming into the transparent\n> preservation sphere that held the disembodied brain. A major jamming\n> surge pulsed out of the knuckle spikes, and a shaped fracture wave\n> shattered the curved glass walls of the protected brain canister.\n> Through the breached container walls, electrafluid spilled like blue\n> gushing blood. Thoughtrodes tore, and the brain fell from its\n> suspender wires, dangling naked in the open, hot air.\n>\n> It might have been the death of Agamemnon.\n>\n> But the cymek general had devised his own trick. The brain inside the\n> transparent container was only a decoy, a synthetic reproduction of\n> his cerebral contours. Agamemnon's actual brain was inside the opaque\n> metal-walled sphere, from which he controlled the gladiator-form. Safe\n> and intact.\n>\n> He was, however, astonished and infuriated. Omnius had proven his\n> willingness to inflict severe damage on the most powerful and talented\n> Titan of all. Omnius's strong urge to avoid losing seemed capable of\n> overriding his programming restrictions. Or had the evermind known\n> about the ruse all along? Agamemnon launched his vindictive response.\n>\n> Even as he spun backward on his walker pads, roaring away as fast as\n> possible, he ejected the now-cracked sphere that contained the false\n> brain. He launched it into the body core of the goliath robot.\n>\n> In his specially constructed body, Agamemnon then ducked down, raising\n> his armored limbs and lowering his shielded brain canister between the\n> rows of thick walker pads to protect himself, like a turtle\n> withdrawing into a shell.\n>\n> The brain sphere struck the damaged gladiator and detonated. The\n> simulated brain had been sculpted from high-energy solid foam. Flames\n> roared past Agamemnon, charring the ground. The resulting explosion\n> bowled over the goliath robot, decapitating it, ripping open its\n> torso. The shockwave was sufficient to knock down part of the nearest\n> coliseum wall.\n>\n> Agamemnon had survived--- and the Omnius gladiator had fallen.\n>\n> \"Excellent, General!\" The computer voice echoed from loudspeakers in\n> the intact portion of the arena, sounding genuinely pleased. \"A most\n> refreshing and enjoyable maneuver.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon still wondered if Omnius had been aware that the visible\n> brain was false. Or perhaps the evermind had found a way to circumvent\n> the protective restrictions Barbarossa had installed so many years\n> ago. Now he would never be sure if the evermind was indeed willing to\n> let him die in combat. Maybe Omnius had to keep the ambitious Titans\n> from feeling too triumphant or overvalued, especially Agamemnon.\n>\n> Only Omnius knew for certain, one way or the other.\n>\n> Amid the smoke and flames rising from the ruin of the goliath machine,\n> Agamemnon raised his gladiator-form, the uncontested victor. \"I have\n> defeated you, Omnius. I wish to claim my reward.\"\n>\n> \"Naturally, General,\" he answered, sounding good-natured. \"You need\n> not even speak your wish. Yes, I shall allow you and your cymeks to\n> lead further strikes against the *hrethgir*. Go forth and enjoy\n> yourselves.\"\n>\n> *Survivors learn to adapt.*\n\n--- ZUFA CENVA,\n\nlecture to Sorceresses\n\n> **I**n the pristine, contoured cabin of the *Dream Voyager*, Vorian\n> Atreides and Seurat cruised between star systems again, picking up and\n> delivering Omnius updates to maintain congruence in the distributed\n> evermind across all the Synchronized Worlds. They exchanged updates\n> with other copies of the evermind, synchronizing the Omnius\n> incarnations, and departing with new data to be shared among the\n> widespread networks. Vor loved being a trustee.\n>\n> Days in space passed, each like the others. The oddly matched pair\n> performed their jobs efficiently. Seurat and the small cadre of\n> maintenance drones assured sterile cleanliness and optimal efficiency\n> in the cabins, while Vor occasionally left food or drink stains,\n> leaving a few items half-finished or in disarray.\n>\n> As he often did, Vor stood at an interactive console in the cramped\n> rear compartment, rummaging in the ship's database to obtain more\n> information about their destinations. He had been taught the benefits\n> of bettering himself in his training among the other privileged humans\n> on Earth. His father's example--- rising from an unknown man to become\n> the greatest of the Titans, conqueror of the Old Empire--- showed him\n> how much even a mere human could accomplish.\n>\n> He was surprised to see that the *Dream Voyager*'s normal route had\n> changed. \"Seurat! Why didn't you tell me we've added a new planet?\n> I've never heard of this . . . Giedi Prime in the Ophiuchi B system.\n> Previously it was listed as a solid League World.\"\n>\n> \"Omnius programmed that destination into our course before we departed\n> from Earth. He expected that your father would have conquered it by\n> the\n>\n> time we arrive.

While Seurat was talented at intricate strategy and could\n> calculate many moves ahead, Vor often pulled off baffling innovative\n> twists to win. Seurat had trouble comprehending the human's erratic\n> behavior. \"I can follow the consequences in a logical progression from\n> an individual event, but I cannot understand how you manage to turn\n> impulsive and illogical behavior into an effective strategy. There is\n> no causal connection.\"\n>\n> Vor smiled at him. \"I'd hate to see you calculate an 'irrational'\n> response, old Metalmind. Leave it to the experts, like me.\"\n>\n> The son of Agamemnon was also quite proficient at military tactics and\n> strategies, a skill he had developed by studying the great battles of\n> ancient human history, as summarized in his father's extensive\n> memoirs. The cymek general made no secret that he hoped his son would\n> become an accomplished military genius one day.\n>\n> Whenever Seurat fell behind in a particular contest, he continued his\n> irritating habit of distracting Vor with jokes, trivia, or\n> anecdotes--- tailoring them to interest the brash young man. During\n> all the time the machine\n>\n> captain had known his human copilot, Seurat had accumulated and\n> assessed information, preparing it for future use. The robot captain\n> had become adept at raising topics that engrossed Vor and sent his\n> thoughts spinning.\n>\n> Seurat chattered incessantly about the legendary life of Agamemnon,\n> adding details Vor had never read in the memoirs: great battles the\n> Titans had won, planets they had added to the Synchronized Worlds, and\n> the warrior-forms Agamemnon had designed for private gladiatorial\n> contests. Once, the robot captain concocted an absurd tale about how\n> the great general had literally lost his mind. The cymek's protected\n> brain canister had accidentally detached from its walker-form and gone\n> tumbling down a hill, while the mechanical body, on automatic\n> programming, had to scamper about and find it.\n>\n> However, Vorian had recently uncovered information more unsettling\n> than anything the robot could ever reveal. Between games and\n> challenges, he often skimmed the open databases, reading his favorite\n> parts of his father's memoirs, trying to make sense of the reams of\n> Omnius's minutiae. On one of those excursions Vor discovered that over\n> the years, Agamemnon had sired twelve other sons. Vorian had never\n> assumed he was the only one--- but a dozen unknown brothers! The great\n> Titan general would naturally have wanted to create descendants worthy\n> of his legacy.\n>\n> Worse, he discovered that each of those dozen sons had proved to be a\n> failure. Agamemnon did not suffer disappointments gladly, and had\n> killed his unacceptable offspring, though they had been privileged\n> trustees just like Vor. The last had been executed nearly a century\n> ago. Now Vor was his father's best hope, but not necessarily the only\n> choice. Agamemnon must still have more sperm in storage . . . and thus\n> Vor was just as expendable as the others.\n>\n> After learning that, Vor became immune to Seurat's attempts at\n> distraction.\n>\n> Now Vor sat at the table, staring at a projected game board and\n> considering his next move. He knew Seurat could not determine what was\n> going on inside the unpredictable human mind. Even with all his\n> independent\n>\n> sophistication, the robot accumulated only external data and did not\n> recognize subtleties.\n>\n> The trustee smiled, just a little, which Seurat did not fail to\n> notice. \"You are playing a little trick on me? Exercising some secret\n> human power?\"\n>\n> Vor continued to smile and stare at the board. It was a multigame\n> competition, revolving inside a three-dimensional screen embedded in\n> the tabletop. Each player attempted to choose a contest or situation\n> that benefited him from a wide selection of games, and then make a\n> move. The score was tied, and the next point would win the contest.\n>\n> The various games came up at random, and each time Vor had only a few\n> seconds to make his move. He watched the shifting graphics as they\n> locked into place momentarily before moving on. The ancient Terran\n> game of Go appeared on the palette of selections; nothing there to\n> benefit him. More options flowed by. A machine-biased game appeared\n> next, one that required more memory than Vor had. He let it pass. Two\n> other games appeared that he didn't like, followed by a poker hand.\n>\n> Relying on luck and bluster, Vor faced off against the robot captain,\n> who could not understand the strategy of bluffing or the \"skill\" of\n> random odds. Vor's expression was unreadable, and he laughed at the\n> confusion he saw on Seurat's mirrored face.\n>\n> \"You lost,\" Vor said. \"And you lost, badly.\" He crossed his arms over\n> his chest, feeling smug after the robot finally folded his hand. \"It's\n> not just the score, but the way you tried to win.\"\n>\n> Seurat responded that he did not wish to play more games, and Vor\n> laughed at him. \"You're sulking, old Metalmind!\"\n>\n> \"I am reassessing my tactics.\"\n>\n> Vor reached across the table and pounded his opponent's slick\n> shoulder, as if to comfort him. \"Why don't you stay here and practice,\n> while I run the ship?

But if she achieved results, all the effort would be\n> justified.\n>\n> Nothing remained but the task itself.\n>\n> Hunched forward in the cockpit, old Wibsen scanned the northern\n> regions to pinpoint the uncompleted transmitter station. Serena had\n> gleaned only a general location from Xavier's report, but she knew the\n> conquering machines wouldn't have bothered with an isolated arctic\n> island while subjugating Giedi Prime's population. So long as they\n> didn't call attention to themselves, perhaps Brigit Paterson's\n> engineers could complete their work without interference.\n>\n> The hardened veteran studied an instrument console, scratching his\n> rough cheek. After his forced retirement, Wibsen had never maintained\n> a crisp, spit-and-polish military appearance; now, at the conclusion\n> of their journey across space, he looked more rumpled than ever. But\n> Serena had not enlisted him for his wardrobe or his personal hygiene\n> habits.\n>\n> He watched streaks of light and blips on a scanner screen. \"There it\n> is. Must be the right island.\" With a satisfied grunt, he began\n> touching buttonpads like a musician playing a keyboard to reveal a\n> weaving but safe course through the machines'electronic sensor net.\n> \"The stealth film on our hull should let us slip right through their\n> surveillance. Sixty, seventy percent chance, I'd say.\"\n>\n> Serena accepted the grim reality. \"That's better odds than the people\n> of Giedi Prime have.\"\n>\n> \"At the moment,\" Wibsen said.\n>\n> Brigit Paterson stepped into the cockpit, not losing her balance as\n> the deck shook in buffeting winds. \"Most of the Armada wouldn't even\n> take the chance. They'd probably write off Giedi Prime until they had\n> a perfect, risk-free opportunity.\"\n>\n> \"We'll just have to show them how it's done,\" Wibsen said. Serena\n> wished Xavier could be here so they could make decisions together.\n>\n> The camouflaged blockade runner sliced through the murky atmosphere at\n> an efficient angle and approached the cold, leaden sea. \"Time to duck\n> out of sight,\" the veteran said. \"Hang on.\"\n>\n> The smooth ship plunged beneath the deep water like a hot iron. The\n> gush of steam was followed by hardly a ripple. Then, concealed by the\n> ocean, the craft glided north toward the coordinates of the rocky\n> island where a nervous Magnus Sumi had built his backup shield\n> transmitters.\n>\n> \"I'd say we're sufficiently out of sensor range,\" Serena said. \"We can\n> breathe easy for a while.\"\n>\n> Wibsen cocked an eyebrow. \"I hadn't even started to sweat yet.\"\n>\n> As if to disprove his remark, he fought to control a sudden coughing\n> spasm while he maneuvered the converted blockade runner through the\n> dim underwater currents. The old man cursed his health, cursed the\n> implanted medical injector in his chest.\n>\n> \"Commander, don't jeopardize this mission because of your stubborn\n> pride,\" Serena scolded.\n>\n> The ship pitched to one side and creaked. Behind a bulkhead something\n> fizzed. \"Damn water turbulence!\" Red-faced, Wibsen kept the blockade\n> runner under control, then turned back to glare at Serena. \"Right now\n> I'm just the chauffeur. I can relax as soon as I drop you off.\"\n>\n> The vessel cruised beneath the surface for an hour, deep enough to\n> avoid any floating chunks of ice from the polar regions, and finally\n> guided them toward a sheltered bay. On the cockpit screens, the\n> approaching island looked stark and rocky, all black cliffs and ice.\n> \"Doesn't look like much of a resort to me,\" Wibsen said.\n>\n> Brigit Paterson said, \"Magnus Sumi didn't choose the site for its\n> beauty. From here, a polar projection is simple and efficient.\n> Coverage from these transmitters is good for all the inhabited land\n> masses.\"\n>\n> Wibsen brought the blockade runner to the surface. \"I still think it's\n> an ugly place.\" As he guided them into the deep harbor embraced by a\n> crescent of cliffs, he began to cough again, louder and worse than\n> before. \"Damned ridiculous timing.\" He looked more annoyed than\n> distressed. \"We're on auto-guide, still on course. Get Jibb over here\n> to fly for a while. This is his home territory after all.\"\n>\n> Curly-haired Pinquer Jibb looked at the approaching island complex,\n> seemingly disappointed that the Home Guard refugees hadn't already\n> completed the work. He took the controls from the veteran and brought\n> the blockade runner to the island's abandoned quays and loading docks.\n> After they had clamped into place, he opened the hatches.\n>\n> Purplish dawn spread like a bruise across the northern sky. Breathing\n> the fresh but biting air, Serena stood in warm clothes with her team\n> members. The rocky island looked forbidding and seemed completely\n> deserted.\n>\n> More heartwarming, though, was the set of silvery towers with\n> parabolic sides and metal-lattice grids. Ice and frost rimed the\n> structures, but they appeared untouched by the thinking-machine\n> invaders.\n>\n> \"Once we switch those on, the robots won't know what hit'em,\" Wibsen\n> said, hauling himself out into the open, looking somewhat recovered.\n> He blew a lungful of white steam onto his hands.\n>\n> Serena kept looking at the towers, a sweeping expression of hope and\n> determination on her face. Brigit Paterson nodded, all business. \"Even\n> so, we've got our work cut out for us.\"\n>\n> *In times of war, every person claims to contribute to the effort.\n> Some give lip service, some provide funds, but few are willing to\n> sacrifice everything. This, I believe, is why we have been unable to\n> defeat the thinking machines.*\n>\n> --- ZUFA CENVA,\n>\n> *The Rossak Weapon*\n>\n> **S**taring at fourteen of the strongest and most dedicated young\n> Sorceresses Rossak had ever produced, Zufa Cenva understood that these\n> women were not the sole hope for humanity. They were not the *only*\n> weapon against the terrible cymeks, not the most powerful blow the\n> League could strike. But they were critical to the war effort.\n>\n> Zufa stood in the fleshy underbrush with her trainees and looked at\n> them with compassion and love. No one in all the League Worlds was\n> more confident of success or devoted to victory. Her heart seemed\n> ready to burst as she saw them focusing every scrap of energy toward\n> the ultimate goal. If only everyone else could be as intent, the\n> thinking machines would be defeated in short order.\n>\n> As she had done for months now, Zufa led her elite group into the\n> jungle where they could practice their skills and summon the power\n> within their spirits. Each of these women was the equivalent of a\n> psychic warhead. Zufa, blessed from birth with more talents than any\n> of them, had been sharing her methods, pushing the others to their\n> limits. She had patiently taught them how to unleash incredible\n> telepathic abilities . . .and how to exercise control. The women had\n> performed admirably, beyond Zufa's most optimistic forecasts.\n>\n> But they must make their effort stand for something.\n>\n> Now she sat on a fallen silvery-barked log that was overgrown with a\n> thick cushion of shelf fungus. The canopy was dense with shadows that\n> interlocked high overhead. Dark purple foliage filtered the caustic\n> rainwater\n>\n> so that droplets trickling like tears to the mulchy ground were fresh\n> and drinkable. Large insects and spiny rodents tore through the soil\n> layers, oblivious to the testing the Sorceresses were about to begin.\n>\n> \"Concentrate. Relax . . . but be prepared to *focus* with all your\n> might, when I command you to do so.\" Zufa looked at the women, all of\n> them tall and pale, with translucent skin and shining white hair. They\n> looked like guardian angels, luminous beings sent to protect humanity\n> against the thinking machines. Could there be any other reason why God\n> had granted them such mental powers?\n>\n> Her gaze moved from face to determined face: Silin, the bold,\n> impulsive one; creative Camio, who improvised forms of attack; Tirbes,\n> still discovering her potential; Rucia, who always chose integrity;\n> Heoma, with the most raw power . . . and nine others. If Zufa were to\n> ask for a volunteer, she knew all of her chosen Sorceresses would\n> demand the honor.\n>\n> It was her task to select who would be the first martyr among them.\n> Xavier Harkonnen was already anxious to depart for Giedi Prime.\n>\n> She loved her trainees as if they were her children . . . and in a\n> very real sense, they were, for they were following her methods,\n> maximizing their potential. These young women were so different from\n> her own Norma. . . .\n>\n> Facing the chief Sorceress, the fourteen stood together, apparently\n> content and calm, but coiled within. Their eyes fell half closed.\n> Their nostrils flared as they breathed, counting heartbeats and using\n> innate biofeedback skills to alter bodily functions.\n>\n> \"Begin to build the power in your mind. Feel it like the static\n> electricity before a lightning storm.\" She saw their expressions\n> flicker as their thoughts stirred.\n>\n> \"Now increase the power one bit at a time. Envision it in your brain,\n> but do not lose control. One step, then another. Feel the energy\n> amplifying--- but do not release it. You must maintain your hold.\"\n>\n> Around her in the dimness of the fungoid jungle, Zufa felt the energy\n> crackling, building. She smiled.\n>\n> Zufa sat back on her log, feeling weak but not daring to show it. Her\n> recent difficult miscarriage, expelling Aurelius Venport's monstrous\n> child, had left her drained. But there was so much work to do, so much\n> she could not delay or delegate. The League Worlds were depending upon\n> her, especially now.\n>\n> Everyone had high expectations of the most powerful Sorceress, but\n> Zufa Cenva placed an even greater burden upon herself. At every turn,\n> her plans and dreams had been hamstrung when people refused to expend\n> the effort or take the necessary risks. These eager, talented trainees\n> seemed different, though, and she assured herself that they would\n> perform up to her standards. Too often when she measured other people,\n> she found them wanting.\n>\n> \"Another notch,\" she said. \"Intensify your power. See how far it can\n> go, but always be careful. An error at this point would wipe us all\n> out--- and the human race cannot afford to lose us.\"\n>\n> Psychic energy pulsed higher. The Sorceresses'pale hair began to drift\n> upward as if gravity had failed. \"Good. Good. Keep it going.\" Their\n> success delighted her.\n>\n> Zufa had never been interested in self-aggrandizement. She was a stern\n> and difficult taskmistress, with little patience or sympathy for the\n> failings of others. The chief Sorceress did not need wealth and profit\n> like Aurelius Venport, or accolades like Tio Holtzman, or even a show\n> of attention like Norma seemed to desire by convincing the Savant to\n> take her as his apprentice. If Zufa Cenva was impatient, she had a\n> right to be. This was a time of great crisis.\n>\n> The underbrush stirred as native insects and rodents scampered away\n> from the pounding psychic waves that built to a crescendo. Trees\n> rustled, leaves and twigs fluttering as if trying to break away from\n> their parent stalks and flee the jungle. Zufa narrowed her eyes and\n> studied her students.\n>\n> Now they were reaching the most dangerous part. The mental energy had\n> increased until their bodies began to shimmer and glow. Zufa had to\n> use her own skills to erect a protective barrier against the combined\n> psychic pressure on her mind. One slip and all would be lost.\n>\n> But she knew these dedicated apprentices would never make such a\n> mistake. They understood the stakes and the consequences. Zufa's heart\n> ached as she gazed upon them.\n>\n> One trainee, Heoma, displayed more strength than her companions. She\n> had built her power to a higher level while still maintaining control.\n> The destructive force could easily have become a wildfire in her brain\n> cells, but Heoma held onto it, staring with unseeing eyes as her hair\n> whipped like a storm.\n>\n> Suddenly, out of dense branches high above, a thick-bodied slarpon\n> dropped, a scaly creature with needle teeth and thick body armor. It\n> tumbled among the young women with a crash, disturbed from its\n> predatory perch and maddened by the backwash of mental energy. All\n> muscle and cartilage, it thrashed, snapping with powerful jaws and\n> scrabbling with thick talons.\n>\n> Startled, Tirbes twitched--- and Zufa felt an uncontrolled surge of\n> power spouting like a released jet of fire. \"No!\" she cried and\n> reached out, summoning her own powers to blanket the student's slip.\n> \"Control!\"\n>\n> Heoma, with perfect calm, pointed toward the slarpon as if she were\n> erasing a smudge on a magnetic board. She drew a line of psychic\n> destruction across the scaly predator. The slarpon burst into\n> white-hot flames, thrashing as its bones turned to charcoal, its skin\n> crackling and tearing until it flaked off in puffs of ash. Flames\n> smoldered out of its now-empty eye sockets.\n>\n> Heoma's companions struggled to clamp down and exert their mental\n> forces. But they had been distracted at a critical moment and were\n> losing their slippery grips on their telepathic battering rams.\n> Steadfastly, Heoma and Zufa maintained a superhuman calmness in their\n> midst, a stark contrast to their frenzied efforts. The combined\n> psychic force rippled and undulated.\n>\n> \"Back down,\" Zufa said, her lips trembling. \"Ease the power away. Draw\n> it into yourself. You must retain it and reel it back into your minds.\n> It is a battery, and you must maintain its charge.\"\n>\n> She breathed deeply, saw that all of her psychic warriors were doing\n> the same. One by one they inhaled, and gradually the tingle in the air\n> dissipated as they began to dampen their constant efforts.\n>\n> \"Enough for now. This is the best you've ever done.\" Zufa opened her\n> eyes and saw her students all staring back at her, Tirbes pale and\n> frightened, the others amazed at how close they had come to\n> self-annihilation. Heoma, an island apart, looked entirely unrattled.\n>\n> In a broad circle around them, the soft fungal underbrush was curled\n> and singed. Zufa studied the blackened foliage, fallen twigs, and\n> shriveled lichens. Another instant, a hair's breadth less control, and\n> everyone would have been vaporized in a ball of telepathic flames.\n>\n> But they had survived. The test had succeeded.\n>\n> After the tension finally evaporated, Zufa allowed herself a smile. \"I\n> am proud of all of you,\" she said, and meant it. \"You . . . my weapons\n> . . . will be ready as soon as the Armada arrives.\"\n>\n> *Mathematical answers are not always expressed numerically. How does\n> one calculate the worth of humanity, or of a single human life?*\n>\n> --- COGITOR KWYNA,\n\nCity of Introspection archives\n\n> **A**t Tio Holtzman's extravagant house, high on a bluff, Norma Cenva\n> spent three exhilarating days settling into her expansive laboratory\n> space. She had so much to do, so much to learn. Best of all, the\n> Savant was eager to listen to her ideas. She couldn't have asked for\n> more.\n>\n> Quiet Poritrin seemed so different from the dense, dangerous jungles\n> and lava-rock canyons of Rossak. She was anxious to explore the\n> streets and canals of Starda, which she could see from her high\n> windows.\n>\n> Tentatively, she asked Holtzman for permission to go down to the\n> river, where she had seen many people performing some kind of work.\n> She felt guilty for even asking, rather than working tirelessly on a\n> means to fight the thinking machines. \"My mind is a little tired,\n> Savant, and I am curious.\"\n>\n> Instead of looking at her skeptically, the scientist wholeheartedly\n> endorsed the idea, as if pleased to have an excuse to accompany her.\n> \"I remind you that we are paid to *think*, Norma. We can do that\n> anywhere.\" He shoved aside a sheet of doodles and sketches. \"Perhaps a\n> bit of sightseeing will inspire you to a work of genius. One can never\n> know when inspiration might strike, or where.\"\n>\n> He led her down a steep stairway that clung to a cliff over the Isana.\n> As she stood beside the taller man, Norma inhaled deeply of the\n> river's smell, sour and peaty from silt and vegetation dragged down\n> from the highlands. For the first time in her life, she felt giddy\n> with her own possibilities; the Savant was genuinely interested in her\n> imagination, her mind, and he listened to her suggestions, unlike the\n> constant scorn she had received from her mother.\n>\n> Norma raised an idea that had occurred to her that morning. \"Savant\n> Holtzman, I have studied your scrambler shields. I believe I\n> understand how they function, and I've been wondering if it might be\n> possible to . . . extend them somehow.\"\n>\n> The scientist showed guarded interest, as if afraid she might\n> criticize his invention. \"Extend them? They already stretch across\n> planetary atmospheres.\"\n>\n> \"I mean a different application entirely. Your scramblers are purely a\n> defensive concept. What if we used the same principles in an\n> *offensive* weapon?\" She watched his expression, detected puzzlement\n> but a willingness to listen.\n>\n> \"A weapon? How do you propose to accomplish that?\"\n>\n> Norma answered in a rush. \"What if we could make a . . . projector?\n> Transmit the field into a thinking machine stronghold, disrupt their\n> gelcircuitry brains. Almost like the electromagnetic pulse from an\n> atomic air burst.\"\n>\n> Holtzman's face lit with comprehension. \"Ah, now I see! Its range\n> would be quite limited, and power requirements off the scale. But\n> perhaps . . . it just might work. Enough to knock out the thinking\n> machines within a substantial radius.\" He tapped his chin, excited by\n> the idea. \"A projector--- good, good!\"\n>\n> They walked along the bank until they reached the foul-smelling\n> expanse of mudflats dotted with sloppy pools. Crews of ragged,\n> half-clothed slaves sloshed out onto the mudflats, some barefoot, some\n> wearing boots that extended to their upper thighs. At regular\n> intervals across the featureless field, flat pallets on pontoons held\n> metal barrels. Laborers marched back and forth to the barrels, where\n> they scooped dripping handfuls of the contents and went to plunge\n> their fingers into lines marked in the soft mud.\n>\n> \"What are they doing?\" Norma asked. It looked as if they were\n> embroidering the mudflats with their work.\n>\n> Holtzman squinted as if he had never considered the details. \"Ah! They\n> are planting clam seedlings, tiny shellfish that we raise from eggs\n> filtered out of the river water. Every spring, slaves plant hundreds\n> of thousands of them, maybe millions. I'm not certain.\" He shrugged.\n> \"The waters will rise again, cover the clam plantings, and then\n> recede. Every autumn, harvesting crews dig up the shellfish: clams as\n> big as your hand.\" He held up his right palm. \"Delicious, especially\n> when fried with butter and mushrooms.\"\n>\n> She frowned to watch the backbreaking labor, the sheer number of\n> people wading in the mud. The concept of captive workers remained\n> strange and unpleasant to her, even Holtzman's teams of solvers.\n>\n> The scientist didn't venture too close to the smell and the slaves,\n> despite Norma's obvious curiosity. \"It's wise to maintain our\n> distance.\"\n>\n> \"Savant, doesn't it strike you as somewhat . . . hypocritical that we\n> fight to keep humans free from the domination of machines, while at\n> the same time some of our own League Worlds use slaves?\"\n>\n> He seemed perplexed. \"But how else would Poritrin get any work done,\n> since we have no sophisticated machines?\" When he finally noticed\n> Norma's troubled look, it took him a moment to realize what bothered\n> her. \"Ah, I've forgotten that Rossak keeps no slaves! Isn't that\n> correct?\"\n>\n> She didn't want to sound critical of her host's way of life. \"We have\n> no need, Savant. Rossak's population is small, with plenty of\n> volunteers to scavenge in the jungles.\"\n>\n> \"I see. Well, Poritrin's economy is based on having hands and muscles\n> for constant labor. Long ago, our leaders signed an edict banning\n> machinery that involves any form of computerization, perhaps a little\n> more extreme than on some other League Worlds. We had no choice but to\n> turn to human labor, a manual workforce.\" Smiling broadly, he gestured\n> toward the mudflat crews. \"It's really not so bad, Norma. We feed and\n> clothe them. Bear in mind, these workers were taken from primitive\n> worlds where they lived squalid lives, dying of diseases and\n> malnourishment. This is paradise for them.\"\n>\n> \"They're all from the Unallied Planets?\"\n>\n> \"Leftovers from colonies of religious fanatics that fled the Old\n> Empire. All Buddislamics. They've fallen to distressing levels of\n> barbarism, barely civilized, living like animals. At least most of our\n> slaves receive a rudimentary education, especially the ones who work\n> for me.\"\n>\n> Norma shaded her eyes from the reflected sunlight and stared\n> skeptically at the bent-backed forms out on the mudflats. Would the\n> slaves agree with the scientist's blithe assessment?\n>\n> Holtzman's face hardened. \"Besides, these cowards owe a debt to\n> humanity, for not fighting the thinking machines as we did. Is it too\n> much to ask their descendants to help feed the survivors and veterans\n> who kept--- and still keep--- the machines at bay? These people\n> forfeited their right to freedom long ago, when they deserted the rest\n> of the human race.\"\n>\n> He seemed offhanded about it and not quite angry, as if the problem\n> was beneath him. \"We have more important work to do, Norma. You and I\n> have a debt to pay as well, and the League of Nobles is counting on\n> us.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THAT EVENING, GRIPPING the cool metal of a wrought-alloy railing, the\n> small woman gazed out from her balcony window at twinkling city\n> lights. Boats and barges on the Isana looked like waterlogged\n> fire-flies. In the gathering darkness, flaming rafts drifted out from\n> the slave sector, mobile bonfires that floated into the marshes. Each\n> fire rose and peaked, then diminished as the burning rafts sputtered\n> and sank.\n>\n> Humming to himself, Holtzman came to offer her a cup of seasoned tea,\n> and Norma asked him about the boats. Squinting out at the drifting\n> bonfires, he was slow to realize what the slaves were doing. \"Ah, must\n> be cremation rafts. The Isana takes the bodies away from the city, and\n> the ashes are carried out to sea. Basically efficient.\"\n>\n> \"But why are there so many of them?\" Norma pointed at the dozens of\n> flickering lights. \"Do slaves die that often, each day?\"\n>\n> Holtzman frowned. \"I heard something about a plague traveling through\n> the worker population. Most unfortunate, requiring a lot of effort to\n> replace them.\" He reassured her quickly, his eyes brightening.\n> \"Nothing you need worry about, though. Truly. We have plenty of good\n> medicines shipped here, enough to tend all the free citizens in Starda\n> if we should happen to fall ill, too.\"\n>\n> \"But what about all the slaves who are dying?\"\n>\n> His reply was not on point. \"Lord Bludd has requested replacements for\n> them. There's a standing order for healthy candidates these days. The\n> Tlulaxa flesh merchants are happy to harvest more men and women from\n> the outlying worlds. Life on Poritrin goes on.\" He reached down to pat\n> Norma's shoulder as if she were a child needing reassurance.\n>\n> From the balcony, she tried to count the floating fires, but soon gave\n> up the effort. Her tea tasted cold and bitter.\n>\n> Behind her, Holtzman continued happily, \"I very much like your idea of\n> using my scrambler-shield concept as a weapon. I am already thinking\n> of how to design a field-portable projector that could be deployed on\n> the ground.\"\n>\n> \"I understand,\" she said, her voice hesitant. \"I will work harder to\n> suggest new ideas.\"\n>\n> Even after he left, Norma could not tear her eyes from the funeral\n> barges blazing across the river, the floating cremation fires. She had\n> seen how the slaves labored in the mudflats planting clam seedlings\n> and in laboratory rooms calculating hundreds of equations. Now they\n> were dying in droves from a deadly fever . . . but were easily\n> replaced.\n>\n> The League of Nobles desperately sought to keep from being enslaved by\n> the thinking machines. Norma wondered about the hypocrisy here.\n\n*All men are* not*created equal, and that is the root of social unrest.*\n\n--- TLALOC,\n\n*A Time for Titans*\n\n> **T**he Tlulaxa slaving crew came down to Harmonthep like a weary\n> convoy instead of a squadron of military raiders.\n>\n> Tuk Keedair rode in the lead ship, but he left the piloting and\n> shooting to the newcomer Ryx Hannem. Not yet jaded to the\n> slave-acquisition business, young Hannem would be eager to please\n> Keedair, and the veteran flesh merchant wanted to see what this novice\n> was made of.\n>\n> Keedair had a flattened nose that had been broken twice in his youth;\n> he liked the way it had healed, imparting rugged character to his\n> wolfish face. In his right ear he wore a triangular gold earring\n> etched with a hieroglyphic mark that he refused to translate for\n> anyone. A thick black braid, tarnished with strands of gray, hung\n> between his shoulders at the left side of his face\n>\n> --- a mark of pride, since commercial tradition required a flesh\n> merchant to slice off the braid after any unprofitable year. And\n> Keedair's had grown long.\n>\n> \"Do we have coordinates yet?\" Hannem asked, looking nervously at his\n> control panel, then out the cockpit wind-shield. \"Where should we\n> start, sir?\"\n>\n> \"Harmonthep's an Unallied Planet, boy, and the Buddislamics don't\n> publish maps. We just look for a village and then harvest the people.\n> Nobody's keeping a census.\"\n>\n> Hannem peered through the viewer, searching for villages. The\n> clustered Tlulaxa ships cruised over a waterlogged green continent. No\n> mountains or hills rose above the soggy landscape of lakes, marshes,\n> and waterways. Harmonthep seemed to have an aversion to pushing its\n> land masses much above sea level. Even the oceans were shallow.\n>\n> After a few more runs, Keedair might take a long furlough back on\n> Tlulax, the closed-off world of his people. It was a nice place to\n> relax, though he was sure he'd get restless again before long. As a\n> \"procurer of human resources,\" Keedair had no regular home.\n>\n> The Tlulaxa biological industry had a constant demand for fresh\n> material, generated from new subjects, untapped genetic lines. By\n> imposing a high degree of secrecy on their work, the Tlulaxa had\n> managed to fool their innocent League customers. When the price was\n> right and the need great, the nobles easily swallowed stories of\n> sophisticated bio-tanks that could grow viable replacement organs. The\n> dedicated researchers eventually hoped to modify their clone-growth\n> tanks to produce such products, but the necessary technology had not\n> yet been attained.\n>\n> It was so much easier to just grab swarms of forgotten humans who\n> lived on outlying worlds. The kidnappings would never be noticed, and\n> the captives would all be carefully catalogued according to their\n> genetics.\n>\n> For the time being, though, the sudden shortage of viable slaves on\n> Poritrin had changed Keedair's business focus. As long as the plague\n> continued, it would be more profitable just to provide living\n> captives, warm bodies that needed no further processing. . . .\n>\n> As the slavers approached the tangled swamps, Keedair tapped the\n> scanned topographic map on his console screen. \"Fly low over that\n> broad stream and follow it. In my experience, you're likely to find\n> villages at a confluence of waterways.\"\n>\n> As the craft swooped down, he spotted large dark shapes moving in the\n> waters, serpentine creatures curling through bamboolike reeds. Huge\n> orange flowers bloomed on the tops of the stalks, opening and closing\n> like fleshy mouths. Keedair was glad he didn't have to stay on this\n> ugly world for long.\n>\n> \"I see something, sir!\" Hannem overlaid a magnified display on the\n> windscreen, pointing out a cluster of huts standing on poles within\n> the marshes.\n>\n> \"Good enough, boy.\" Keedair contacted the slaver ships in their wake.\n> \"Just like plucking fruit from a nobleman's garden.\"\n>\n> The marsh village did not look substantial. The round huts were made\n> of reeds and mud, fused with some sort of plastic cement. A few\n> antennas, mirrors, and wind collectors hung between them, although the\n> Buddislamics used little sophisticated technology. He doubted the\n> harvest from this single village would fill the holds, but he was\n> always optimistic. Business had been good lately.\n>\n> Three attack ships flanked Keedair's lead craft, while the Tlulaxa\n> human-cargo vessels were in the rear. Ryx Hannem looked uneasy as the\n> slavers approached the village. \"Are you sure we have sufficient\n> weaponry, sir? I've never been on a raid like this before.\"\n>\n> Keedair raised an eyebrow. \"These are Zensunnis, boy, pacifists to the\n> core. When the thinking machines came, these cowards didn't have the\n> balls to fight. I doubt we'll come out of it with so much as a bruise.\n> Trust me, you'll never see so much gnashing of teeth and wringing of\n> hands. They're pathetic.\"\n>\n> He opened the comchannel and spoke to his harvesting crew. \"Knock the\n> poles out from under three outlying huts and dump them into the water.\n> That'll bring people running out. Then we'll use stun-projectors.\" His\n> voice was calm, a bit bored. \"We'll have plenty of time to round up\n> the valuable ones. If there are any severe injuries, take them for the\n> organ stockpiles, but I'd prefer intact bodies.\"\n>\n> Hannem gazed at him worshipfully. Keedair spoke again into the\n> comchannel. \"There'll be profits enough for everyone, and a bonus for\n> each young male and fertile female you take without damage.\"\n>\n> The linked pilots raised a cheer, then the four raider ships swooped\n> toward the helpless swamp village. Young Hannem held back as the\n> more-experienced slavers flew in. With hot beams, they chopped through\n> the tall poles and let the rickety huts topple into the murky water.\n>\n> \"Well--- open fire, boy!\" Keedair said.\n>\n> Hannem discharged his weapons, disintegrating one of the thick support\n> legs and strafing open the side of a hut wall, setting the reeds on\n> fire.\n>\n> \"Not so much destruction,\" Keedair said, forcing a veneer of calm over\n> his impatience. \"You don't want to harm the villagers. We haven't even\n> had a chance to look them over yet.\"\n>\n> Just as he had predicted, the pathetic Zensunni came boiling out of\n> their huts. Some shimmied down ladders and poles to reach wobbly boats\n> tied up against their hovels.\n>\n> At the edge of the village, the two human-cargo ships landed in the\n> marsh water with hissing splashes, their friction-hot hulls creating\n> steam. Pontoons opened up to keep the ships afloat, and loading ramps\n> extended to solid-looking grassy hummocks.\n>\n> Keedair directed Hannem to land near the scurrying knots of people.\n> Some splashed into the waist-deep water, while women dragged children\n> into reed thickets and young men brandished spears that looked more\n> suitable for catching fish than for warfare.\n>\n> The first Tlulaxa raiders set down gently, extending flat-footed\n> landing struts that sank into the mud. By the time Keedair emerged\n> onto a mound of trampled grasses with his stun-projector in his hands,\n> his companions were already out and opening fire, selecting their\n> targets carefully.\n>\n> The healthy men were marked first, because they were worth the most on\n> the Poritrin market, and because they were the likeliest to cause\n> trouble, if given the chance.\n>\n> Keedair handed the stun weapon to a grinning but intimidated Ryx\n> Hannem. \"Better start shooting, boy, if you want to bag any of this\n> booty.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THE BOY ISHMAEL confidently guided his boat along the waterways,\n> threading his way through the maze of creeks and passages. The reeds\n> were much taller than his head, even when he stood up in the wobbly\n> little craft. The orange flowers at tops of the reeds opened and\n> closed with smacking sounds, feasting on gnats that drifted through\n> the air.\n>\n> Eight years old, Ishmael had been foraging by himself for a long time\n> now. His maternal grandfather, who had raised him after the death of\n> his parents, had taught him well. Ishmael knew how to unearth secret\n> stashes of qaraa eggs that even the giant eels couldn't find.\n>\n> He'd found a good patch of salad leaves and had caught two fish, one\n> of a species he'd never seen before. His basket clattered and jiggled\n> as the venomous creatures inside crawled up and down the walls,\n> thrusting spiny black legs through the tiny holes. He had captured\n> eighteen milkbugs today, too, each as large as his hand. The family\n> would eat well tonight!\n>\n> But as he approached the village, guiding his boat smoothly through\n> the brown water, Ishmael heard shouts and screams along with buzzing\n> sounds. Static discharges. Ishmael paddled quickly but cautiously. The\n> reeds were too tall for him to see anything.\n>\n> As he rounded an oxbow, he saw the slaver ships, one of the biggest\n> fears of his tribe and the reason they had built their village in such\n> an isolated place. Several huts had been toppled, while others were\n> afire. Impossible!\n>\n> The boy wanted to yell and charge in fighting, but better judgment\n> told him to flee. Ishmael watched Tlulaxa slavers pointing their\n> stun-projectors, dropping one villager after another. Some of the\n> people tried to hide inside dwellings, but raiders smashed their way\n> through.\n>\n> The Zensunni had no locks on their doors, no shielded places to hide.\n> As followers of Buddallah, they were a peaceful people. Never had\n> there been war among villages on Harmonthep; at least Ishmael had\n> never heard of such a thing.\n>\n> His heart pounded. Such a loud commotion would attract the giant eels,\n> though the predators were generally sluggish in the daytime. If these\n> raiders did not quickly retrieve stunned villagers who had fallen into\n> the water, the eels would have a feast. . . .\n>\n> Without making so much as a ripple on the water, Ishmael moved his\n> boat closer to one of the raider ships. He saw his cousin Taina\n> crumple from a stun-blast and then be grabbed by dirty-looking men who\n> loaded her motionless body onto a wide metal raft.\n>\n> Ishmael didn't know what to do. He heard a roaring sound in his\n> ears--- his own blood flowing, his gasping breath.\n>\n> Then his grandfather, Weyop, pushed forward to the center of the huts,\n> and faced the chaos. The old leader carried a thin bronze gong\n> dangling from a pole, symbol of his office as the village spokesman.\n> Ishmael's grandfather did not seem at all afraid, and the boy felt\n> instant relief. He had faith in the wise man, who always found a way\n> to resolve disputes. Weyop would save the villagers now.\n>\n> But deep in his heart, Ishmael felt a terrible dread, knowing that\n> this would not end so simply.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> RYX HANNEM PROVED to be a fairly good shot. After the novice had\n> stunned his first captive, he continued with enthusiasm. Keedair kept\n> a mental count, estimating the haul, though he would not have an\n> accurate tally until the unconscious bodies were placed inside stasis\n> coffins for transport.\n>\n> Keedair clenched his jaw as the Zensunnis wailed and pleaded---\n> probably in much the same manner as the population of Giedi Prime had\n> begged during the recent thinking-machine conquest. Keedair had\n> business associates in Giedi City, but he doubted he'd ever see them\n> alive again.\n>\n> No, he couldn't dredge up any sympathy for these Zensunni bastards.\n>\n> Hannem called attention to an old man who stepped forward. \"What does\n> he think he's doing, sir?\" The old man repeatedly banged a metallic\n> gong on a long staff. Hannem raised his stunner. \"Do we take him?\"\n>\n> Keedair shook his head. \"Too old. Don't even waste a stun-blast on\n> him.\"\n>\n> Two of the experienced slavers thought the same way. They broke the\n> tribal leader's staff and pushed him into the water, then laughed when\n> he shouted curses in a mixture of his native tongue and Galach, a\n> universal language among the human planets. The humiliated old man\n> swam to shore.\n>\n> The remaining villagers wailed and wept, but most of the healthy young\n> ones were already stunned and in the boats. Old women and dirty\n> children cried out, but attempted no resistance. Keedair looked\n> knowingly at Ryx Hannem.\n>\n> Suddenly a boy sprang out of the reeds behind them, jumping from a\n> narrow boat. He threw sticks at Hannem and Keedair, yelling something\n> about his grandfather. Keedair ducked. A rock narrowly missed him.\n>\n> Then the boy grabbed a basket out of his boat and hurled it at Hannem.\n> The flimsy wickerwork broke and spilled a swarm of huge spiny-legged\n> insects that tumbled over Hannem's chest and face, biting. The copilot\n> let out a thin shriek as he batted at the creatures, squashing them,\n> but they continued to scramble up his arms and clothes. Their smashed\n> bodies oozed a thick milky substance that looked like pus.\n>\n> Keedair grabbed Hannem's stun-projector and directed it at the scrappy\n> youth. As the boy fell, Keedair also sprayed his copilot with a\n> paralyzing blast. It wasn't the best way, but at least it\n> incapacitated the aggressive venomous insects, in addition to Hannem.\n> Once aboard the cargo ship, they would put the injured slaver into a\n> stasis coffin, along with the new captives. Keedair didn't know if the\n> lad would die, or just have nightmares for the rest of his life.\n>\n> He shouted for the rest of the Tlulaxa to gather up the unconscious\n> people. It looked as if they might need the second cargo ship after\n> all. *Not a bad*\n>\n> *day*, he thought. He studied the motionless form of the native boy;\n> the scrappy Zensunni youth was certainly impetuous and foolish. This\n> one would be a handful for whichever human master purchased him.\n>\n> But that wasn't Keedair's concern. Let Poritrin deal with the problem.\n> Even stunned and dirty, the wiry boy looked healthy enough, though\n> maybe a little young to take with the other slaves. Out of annoyance,\n> Keedair decided to include the youth anyway. This one had caused him\n> trouble and might need punishment, especially if Hannem ended up\n> dying.\n>\n> The old village elder stood on the shore, soaking wet, shouting\n> Buddislamic sutras at the raiders, telling them the errors of their\n> ways. Bodies floated in the water, facedown. Some of the desperate\n> villagers used poles to nudge the bodies back toward shore, sniveling\n> and wailing the whole time.\n>\n> Keedair saw large black serpentine forms swimming along the narrow\n> canals, attracted by the noise. One of them raised its head out of the\n> water and snapped a fang-filled mouth. The sight of the ferocious\n> animal sent a shudder down Keedair's back. Who knew what other\n> creatures lived around here?\n>\n> Anxious to be away from the stinking swamps, he urged his crew to\n> hurry. He watched as the new slaves were loaded onto the ships. He\n> would be glad to get back aboard his own clean vessel. Nevertheless,\n> the profits from this operation would be well worth the inconvenience\n> and discomfort.\n>\n> When all was ready, he climbed back into his own ship, started the\n> engines and retracted the mud-encrusted stabilizers. As he lifted off\n> into the hazy sky, Tuk Keedair looked down into the marsh and watched\n> the giant eels begin to feed on a few stray bodies.\n>\n> *Mind rules the universe. We must make certain it is the Human mind,\n> rather than the Machine version.*\n\n--- PRIMERO FAYKAN BUTLER,\n\n*Memoirs of the Jihad*\n\n> **Z**ufa Cenva chose her most talented student to be Rossak's first\n> weapon against the cymeks on Giedi Prime. Strong and dedicated, the\n> Sorceress Heoma appeared more than ready to answer the call.\n>\n> From her cliff city on Rossak, Zufa coordinated the operation with the\n> League Armada. The chief Sorceress bit her lower lip and blinked\n> stinging tears of pride from her eyes.\n>\n> Serena Butler's unexpected and ill-advised mission provided the\n> necessary impetus to galvanize the Armada into an offensive. Amidst\n> the arguing and saber-rattling, Xavier Harkonnen had put forth a\n> well-integrated operational plan for the attack. Then he had convinced\n> his commanding officer to let him spearhead the strike. Now, high over\n> Rossak, the battle group of ballista battleships and javelin\n> destroyers was ready to depart from the orbital stations.\n>\n> The initial retaliation against the machine invaders must be a\n> dramatic and complete victory, much more than a localized fight. Each\n> planet affected the others, like the links of a chain. Tercero\n> Harkonnen would lead an Armada battle group, carrying Tio Holtzman's\n> brand new field-portable scramblers to knock out key robotic\n> installations.\n>\n> A Sorceress, though, must deal with the cymeks, whose human brains\n> would be unaffected by the scrambler pulse. Eager for the opportunity,\n> Heoma had accepted her role without hesitation.\n>\n> She was a lean young woman, twenty-three years old, with ivory-white\n> hair, almond eyes, and a plain-featured face that belied the strength\n> and turmoil within her powerful mind. But Zufa knew more than just\n> this woman's\n>\n> mental skills; she knew Heoma as a dear person, a daughter like she\n> wished she'd had herself. Heoma was the eldest of five sisters; three\n> of the others had already been indoctrinated as Sorceress trainees.\n>\n> Zufa stood before her top prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and placed her hands on Heoma's bony\n> shoulders. \"You understand how much rides on this. I know you will not\n> disappoint me, or humanity.\"\n>\n> \"I will achieve everything you expect of me,\" Heoma promised. \"Perhaps\n> even more.\"\n>\n> Zufa's heart swelled. As the straight-backed Heoma boarded the\n> shuttle, the chief Sorceress called after her, \"You won't be alone. We\n> all ride on your wings.\"\n>\n> During the final preparations, with stern words and a hard expression,\n> Zufa had spoken to the strongest Rossak men, chastising them for their\n> inability to play a useful part in the crucial fight. Simply because\n> they were impotent telepathically did not preclude their participation\n> in other ways. The assault on Giedi Prime needed their help as well.\n> With her flinty gaze, the statuesque Sorceress had shamed six of them\n> into accompanying Heoma as bodyguards.\n>\n> The Rossak men brought their personal supplies of stimulants and\n> mind-numbing painkillers, provided by Aurelius Venport. They had\n> undergone rigorous weapons training and learned powerful hand-to-hand\n> combat techniques. When the time came, they would become fanatic\n> warriors, charging into battle with no concern for their own survival,\n> with no goal but to enable the Sorceress weapon to get close enough to\n> the cymeks. Venport had prepared the drugs carefully, creating a\n> cocktail that would keep the men functional through the worst horrors.\n>\n> As she watched the shuttle ascend in a silvery arc to the waiting\n> javelins and ballistas, Zufa's thoughts were in turmoil, full of\n> regret and anticipation. She tried to wall those emotions behind a\n> shield of confidence and a vow of duty.\n>\n> Aurelius Venport came to stand silently beside her, as if he too was\n> at a loss for words. The man was perceptive enough to pick up on\n> Zufa's sadness at seeing her prize student depart. \"It'll be all\n> right.\"\n>\n> \"No it won't. But she will succeed.\"\n>\n> Venport looked at her with a warm understanding that penetrated Zufa's\n> prickly demeanor. \"I know you wish you could have been the first\n> weapon yourself, my dear. Heoma is certainly talented, but *you* are\n> unquestionably more skilled than anyone. Just remember that you're\n> still recovering from your miscarriage, and that weakness might have\n> jeopardized the mission.\"\n>\n> \"And I am bound by the higher responsibility of training others.\" Zufa\n> watched the shuttle disappear into the thin clouds. \"I have no choice\n> but to remain here and do what I can.\"\n>\n> \"Funny. I was thinking the same thing about my own work.\"\n>\n> Recalling the gullible male bodyguards, the Sorceress studied her mate\n> with undisguised scorn. His patrician eyes were incisive, clear of\n> corrupting drugs, but his independent attitude grated on her. \"Why did\n> you not volunteer to join the operation, Aurelius? Or is it not in you\n> to do something selfless, beyond your perception of yourself?\"\n>\n> \"I am a patriot in my own way.\" Venport returned her expression with a\n> wry smile. \"But I never expect you to see it.\"\n>\n> She had no response for that, and the two of them continued to stare\n> blankly at the sky long after the shuttle had reached the stations in\n> orbit.\n>\n> *I don't believe there is such a thing as a \"lost cause\"--- only those\n> without suitably dedicated followers.*\n\n--- SERENA BUTLER,\n\n*address to League Parliament*\n\n> **D**espite Magnus Sumi's optimistic report, the secondary\n> shield-transmitting station on Giedi Prime was not at all near\n> completion.\n>\n> When Serena's covert team landed on the rocky, wind-swept island in\n> the northern sea, they spent a day bringing their supplies and\n> equipment to shore, breaking open the barracks buildings and\n> restarting the power-generating huts. The parabolic towers for the\n> scrambler-shield transmitters stood like frost-encrusted skeletons.\n> But none of the systems were functional.\n>\n> Once Brigit Paterson had scanned the status of the work, the engineer\n> came to Serena with a frown on her wind-chapped face. \"The best I can\n> say is that it won't be *impossible* to complete the work.\" She\n> shrugged her broad shoulders. \"The framework and heavy construction\n> are all completed, but most of the components have not yet been wired.\n> The substations aren't linked, and the cables haven't even been strung\n> to the highest girders.\" She pointed to the ice-slick bars moaning in\n> the breeze.\n>\n> Serena did not envy the volunteer who would climb up there and finish\n> the vital linkages. \"We don't know exactly when Xavier is bringing the\n> Armada for us, but if you're not done by the time those ships arrive,\n> we may as well not bother. We'll have let him down, along with the\n> people of Giedi Prime.\"\n>\n> Brigit summoned her engineers for an emergency meeting. \"We brought\n> enough stimulants along. We can work round the clock, provided we rig\n> area lighting to illuminate the platforms.\"\n>\n> \"Do it,\" Serena said, \"and press us into service if there's anything\n> we can do. Commander Wibsen was looking forward to a few days of rest,\n> but\n>\n> we'll shake him out of his bunk if we have to, and make him useful.\"\n> Brigit gave a wry smile. \"I'd like to see that.\"\n>\n> Over the next week they worked unmolested. The thinking machines did\n> not know they had sneaked in, or what they were doing. Suffering no\n> more than a few minor bruises, the team completed the most perilous\n> parts of the job. While the task was ninety-percent complete--- at\n> least, according to the plan on paper--- Brigit Paterson said the\n> remaining steps were the most time-consuming ones.\n>\n> \"We have to go component by component and harden the circuits. By\n> their very nature, these transmitting towers generate a field that\n> obliterates complex gelcircuitry. We need to make sure the system will\n> last more than five minutes once we activate it.\"\n>\n> Serena bit her lip and nodded. \"Yes, that would be a good thing.\"\n>\n> \"And if we're too obvious with our testing,\" Brigit continued, \"some\n> of the damned machines might figure out what we're doing. It's a\n> touchy process.\"\n>\n> \"How much time?\" Ort Wibsen asked, chewing on his own impatience.\n>\n> \"A week, if we're lucky.\" Brigit frowned. \"Ten days if anything goes\n> wrong and we need to fix pieces.\"\n>\n> \"Eight days is the absolute soonest the Armada could arrive,\" Serena\n> said. \"That assumes Xavier organized the attack force and launched\n> within two days of receiving my message.\"\n>\n> Wibsen grumbled, \"That'll never happen with the League. They'll call\n> meeting after meeting, then break for long lunches, then hold more\n> meetings.\"\n>\n> Serena sighed. \"I'm hoping Xavier can cut through all that.\"\n>\n> \"Yeah,\" Wibsen said, \"and I'm hoping the robots will all just leave\n> Giedi Prime voluntarily . . . but it's not bloody likely to happen.\"\n>\n> \"Keep your engineers busy,\" Serena said to Brigit Paterson, paying no\n> heed to the veteran's pessimism. \"Commander Wibsen and I will take the\n> blockade runner. We'll slip back through the sensor net and try to\n> intercept the incoming Armada. Xavier needs to know the plan so he can\n> take advantage of what we've done. We can give them a timetable and\n> coordinate the assault.\"\n>\n> Wibsen coughed, and scowled ferociously. \"Better take Pinquer Jibb,\n> too, in case I need backup in flying the blockade runner.\"\n>\n> Curly-haired Jibb looked uncertain, glancing from Serena to the old\n> veteran and then to the lead engineer. \"Maybe the Commander should\n> just stay here?\"\n>\n> The veteran spat onto the frozen ground. \"Not on your life. It's a\n> *remote* chance that I'll need any help.\"\n>\n> \"If you say so,\" Serena answered, covering a knowing smile. \"Brigit,\n> you'll be able to detect the Armada when they come into the system?\"\n>\n> \"We're monitoring the thinking-machine communications net. I'm\n> assuming once the Armada battleships approach, the robots will be all\n> atwitter with excitement.\" Brigit looked to her team and then gave a\n> grim smile. \"Yeah, we'll know.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> MOVING UNDERWATER AGAIN, the blockade runner cruised through the cold\n> depths away from the ice-choked northern sea. Looking over his\n> shoulder in the cockpit, Wibsen said philosophically, \"When we started\n> this mission, I thought you were crazy, Serena Butler.\"\n>\n> \"Crazy to try and help these people?\" She raised her eyebrows.\n>\n> \"No--- I thought you were crazy to give me another chance.\"\n>\n> According to his original mapping while guiding the ship through the\n> atmosphere, Ort Wibsen had identified weak spots in the robotic sensor\n> net girdling the planet. By emerging in the open sea at about forty\n> degrees north latitude, they could fly the stealth-coated vessel up\n> through the tenuous blanket with a reasonable chance of remaining\n> undetected by machine sentries in orbit and on the ground. The\n> patterns of observation flickered irregularly like invisible\n> spotlights across the open skies.\n>\n> \"We'll sit quietly here,\" he said, coughing again and slapping the\n> medical injector on his chest as if it were an annoying insect. \"We'll\n> bide our time until I'm damned sure I know their routine.\"\n>\n> \"That's one thing you can say about thinking machines,\" said Pinquer\n> Jibb, looking uneasy. \"They're certainly predictable.\"\n>\n> Cymeks, however, were not.\n>\n> Less than an hour later, fast-moving mechanical airfoils raced in,\n> converging on the half-submerged blockade runner. Wibsen cursed a\n> proverbial blue streak, then coughed up a mouthful of scarlet blood.\n>\n> \"Eleven of them!\" Pinquer Jibb cried, looking at the scanners. \"How\n> did they find us?\"\n>\n> \"How did you not see them?\" Wibsen snapped. \"They emerged from\n> underwater just like we did!\"\n>\n> Serena looked at the screen, seeing the numerous robot-driven\n> interceptor ships closing in on them. Activating the blockade runner's\n> starboard weaponry, she shot at the oncoming airfoils, hitting one and\n> missing the others. She had not been trained as a weapons officer. If\n> they'd expected to fight their way through, they never would have\n> taken on the challenge of infiltrating Giedi Prime.\n>\n> \"Jibb, take the controls and prepare for liftoff.\" Wibsen lurched out\n> of the cockpit. \"By hell, they'll not take us so easily.\" He jabbed a\n> big-knuckled finger at the copilot. \"Watch for your chance after I\n> leave--- and don't hesitate.\"\n>\n> \"What're you going to do?\" Serena asked. The old veteran didn't\n> answer, but raced across the deck and dove inside the single lifepod.\n>\n> \"What's he doing?\" Jibb said.\n>\n> \"No time to court-martial him now.\" Serena couldn't believe the\n> veteran would just leave them to the thinking machines.\n>\n> Wibsen sealed the hatch of the lifepod and green lights shone around\n> the rim, indicating he was preparing for launch.\n>\n> Serena shot another blast from the starboard weapons, the only ones\n> aimed toward the oncoming thinking machines. She crippled another\n> vessel, but in a united effort, the cymeks and robots fired at the\n> blockade runner, ripping open the weapons ports. Serena looked with\n> dismay at her control systems. They flickered, sparked, went dead.\n>\n> With a lurch and an explosive thump, Wibsen's lifepod shot out like a\n> cannonball. It roared away, a fast-moving, heavily armored projectile,\n> barely skimming over the surface. Over the SOS frequency, the old\n> veteran said, \"Don't be asleep at the switch, now. Be ready!\"\n>\n> Pinquer Jibb powered up their engines, preparing to fly. The ship\n> began to cut a line through the water.\n>\n> Wibsen did his best to aim the lifepod toward the robotic targets.\n> Designed simply to carry a survivor to safety from a catastrophic\n> explosion, the escape vessel had thick shielding and hull plating---\n> and when it hammered into the closest enemy, it annihilated the cymek\n> ship, blasting all the way through and slamming into a second.\n> Battered and smoking amid the sinking wreckage, the lifepod came to a\n> halt.\n>\n> Serena shouted to Jibb. \"Go! Take off!\"\n>\n> He increased thrust, and the blockade runner lifted off from the\n> water, heaving itself into the sky. As they climbed, Serena looked at\n> the imager that showed the water below.\n>\n> In the wreckage of the two thinking-machine aerofoils, she saw the\n> lifepod hatch open. Wibsen emerged, battered but still defiant. Around\n> him, smoke and steam roiled into the air, and three angry cymeks\n> churned toward him.\n>\n> The old veteran reached into his pocket and hurled a dull gray sphere\n> at the nearest cymek vessel. The explosion knocked the enemy back and\n> also sent Wibsen toppling into the lifepod's hatch. He waved a pulse\n> cartridge rifle unsteadily with one hand, shooting again and again,\n> but three armored cymeks pounced upon him from their own aerofoil\n> vessels. Serena watched in horror as their articulated mechanical\n> claws ripped the old veteran to pieces.\n>\n> \"Hold on!\" Pinquer Jibb shouted, too late. Serena saw robotic vessels\n> aiming their heavy weaponry along the trajectory of the fleeing\n> blockade runner.\n>\n> \"I can't---\"\n>\n> The impact smashed Serena against the far wall. Explosions ripped out\n> their ship's engines. The craft began to plunge, Jibb unable to\n> reverse their fall back toward the ocean. The blockade runner careened\n> into the waves like a huge out-of-control sled, spraying up a high\n> tail of white foam. Water began to gush through cracks in the hull.\n>\n> Serena ran to the weapons locker, grabbed a pulse cartridge rifle of\n> her own. Slinging the weapon over her shoulder, though she had never\n> fired one before, she made ready to defend herself. Pinquer Jibb\n> grabbed another weapon from the open armory closet.\n>\n> With clanging sounds like impacting torpedoes, cymeks slammed into the\n> crippled ship. Without even attempting to use the normal access\n> hatches,\n>\n> they cut their way through the hull, ripping into the central\n> compartment like birds trying to get at the tasty meat inside a\n> seashell.\n>\n> Jibb opened fire as the first silvery arms protruded through the split\n> wall. A pulse-bolt damaged the cymek's arm but also ricocheted around\n> the ship's interior, inadvertently blasting the breach even wider.\n>\n> Another cymek came in from the top hatch, prying open the armor and\n> dropping its limber body into the chamber. Serena launched a\n> pulse-bolt, scorching its core. With a lucky second shot, she fried\n> the brain canister. A larger cymek worked its way in from above,\n> grabbing the fallen mechanical body and using it as a shield as she\n> poured more pulse projectiles into it.\n>\n> Next to Pinquer Jibb, a cymek shaped like a black beetle continued to\n> work its way through the hole torn in the hull. The copilot turned and\n> attempted to fire again, but the cymek thrust a long pointed arm\n> forward. Jibb dropped his gun as the robotic arm plunged through his\n> chest like a spear. Blood blossomed from the center of his uniform.\n>\n> The morphing end of the sharp leg shaft suddenly sprouted clawlike\n> fingers, and as the cymek yanked his hand back out of his victim's\n> chest, he tore out the dripping heart and held it up like a trophy.\n>\n> Above, the largest cymek threw the nonfunctional body of his dead\n> mechanical companion at Serena. The heavy hulk crashed down, cutting\n> and bruising her. Trapped, she couldn't move, pinned to the deck.\n>\n> The beetle cymek, blood still dripping from its spearlike limb,\n> wrenched its way through the gaping hull and clattered forward,\n> leaving Jibb's body behind. It raised two more pointed forearms above\n> Serena, but the largest cymek bellowed for him to stop.\n>\n> \"Don't kill them both or we'll have nothing to give Erasmus. He asked\n> for one of the feisty resistance fighters from Giedi Prime. This one\n> will do nicely.\"\n>\n> Hearing his words, Serena was terrified. Something ominous in the tone\n> made her think she would be better off if she simply died here. Gashes\n> in her arm, her ribs, and her left leg were bleeding onto the deck.\n>\n> Jibb's killer snatched the pulse projectile rifle out of her hands,\n> while the larger cymek lifted away the fallen body. He stretched out a\n> grappling arm and snagged her with a flexible metal fist. The Titan\n> lifted her off the deck, then held her face close to his glittering\n> optic threads.\n>\n> \"Oh, so lovely. Even after a thousand years, I can still appreciate\n> beauty. If only I were human again, I could demonstrate my full\n> admiration.\" His sensors glinted cruelly. \"I am Barbarossa. It's a\n> shame I'll have to send you to Erasmus on Earth. For your sake, I hope\n> he will find you interesting.\"\n>\n> Sharp silver limbs pinioned her in a huge grasp, like a gigantic cage.\n> Serena struggled, but could not get away. She knew of Barbarossa, one\n> of the original tyrants who had taken over the Old Empire.

He scanned territory designated as\n> \"Unallied Planets,\" not yet claimed by machines or human vermin. So\n> many star systems for him to explore, conquer, and develop, and these\n> prototype Giedi Prime probes would make that possible.

He was safe and protected . . . though a bit\n> bored.\n>\n> For the first time in his life, Selim was self-sufficient, no longer\n> captive to the whims of villagers who ordered him around because he\n> was of unknown parentage. He could hardly grasp the wealth at his\n> disposal, and he hadn't even begun to uncover all the strange\n> technological objects from the Old Empire.\n>\n> He remembered when he and his turncoat friend Ebrahim had scavenged\n> the desert with other Zensunni, including Naib Dhartha and his young\n> son Mahmad. Once, Selim had found a melted knob of fused circuitry,\n> obviously from an exploded ship. It had been sand-scoured into an\n> unusual, colorful conglomerate. He had wanted to give the trinket to\n> Glyffa, the old woman who had sometimes taken care of him. But Ebrahim\n> had grabbed the fused component and rushed off to show it to Naib\n> Dhartha, asking if he could keep it as a treasure. Instead, the Naib\n> had taken it from him and tossed it into a pile sold to a scrap\n> merchant. No one had given a thought for Selim. . . .\n>\n> Still, as the time in this place drifted into weeks he discovered\n> aspects and dimensions of loneliness. Day after day he sat in front of\n> the scratched windows, watching the storms fade, bringing bloodred\n> sunsets splashed with colorful hues. He looked out at the clean dunes\n> undulating toward the\n>\n> endless horizon. The immense mounds had metamorphosed like living\n> creatures, yet in essence they always remained the same.\n>\n> Across such an expanse, it seemed impossible that he would ever see\n> another human being again. But Buddallah would give him a sign of what\n> he was expected to do. He just hoped it came soon.\n>\n> Much of the time Selim occupied himself inside the empty station with\n> solitary games he'd learned to play when he was younger. In the\n> village, he had been ostracized by others who traced their paternity\n> back a dozen generations or more, even before the wanderers'arrival on\n> Arrakis.\n>\n> From the time he'd been a toddler, Selim had been raised by different\n> Zensunni, none of whom had adopted him as part of their family. He had\n> always been an impulsive and energetic lad. Any real mother would have\n> been patient with his mischievous misbehavior, but Selim had no real\n> mother. On Arrakis, where survival balanced on a razor's edge, few\n> would expend effort for a young man who seemed intent on making\n> nothing of himself.\n>\n> Once, he had accidentally spilled water--- an entire day's ration---\n> while working in a storage alcove. As punishment, Naib Dhartha had\n> denied him any fluids for two days, insisting that he must learn his\n> lesson if he was to be a part of the tribe. But Selim had never seen\n> such a punishment inflicted on any others who had committed comparable\n> mistakes.\n>\n> When he'd been only eight Standard Years old, he had gone exploring\n> out on the cliffs and rocks, hunting lizards, searching for hardy\n> weeds with edible roots. While he was out there a sandstorm had caught\n> him by surprise, hurling dust and grit against the mountains, forcing\n> him into shelter. Selim remembered how frightened he had been, hiding\n> alone for two days. When he'd finally made his way back to the cliff\n> city, expecting to be greeted with relief, he saw that none of the\n> Zensunnis had even noticed his disappearance.\n>\n> Conversely, Ebrahim, the son of a respected tribal father, had too\n> many siblings for anyone to pay attention to him. Perhaps to\n> compensate,\n>\n> Ebrahim got into a lot of trouble himself, constantly testing the\n> limits of the Naib's restrictions while cleverly making sure the\n> worthless waif Selim was around, just in case someone needed to be\n> blamed.\n>\n> As an unwanted scamp, Selim never experienced the parameters of true\n> comradeship. He had always accepted Ebrahim's manipulations at face\n> value, without considering the possibility that the other boy might be\n> taking advantage of him. Selim had been slow to learn his lesson, and\n> did so only after paying the price of exile into the desert, where he\n> was expected to die.\n>\n> But he had lived. He had ridden Shaitan, and Buddallah had guided him\n> to this hidden place. . . .\n>\n> While the long storms made him restless, Selim became more determined\n> in exploring the research station. He studied the banks of\n> sophisticated instruments and records but did not understand the\n> antique technology.

Since this station had remained\n> intact for hundreds, maybe thousands of years, it should be able to\n> withstand a bit of tinkering from a curious young man. . . .\n>\n> Some of the power cells were still active, barely, and he was able to\n> switch systems on, make panels glow. Finally he stumbled upon a way to\n> activate a log entry, a holorecording of a tall man with strange\n> facial features, large eyes, and pale skin. The bones of his face had\n> an unusual set, as if he came from a different race of humans. The\n> Imperial scientist wore bright garments, some metallic, others bearing\n> unusual designs. He and other researchers had been stationed here to\n> test the resources of Arrakis and assess its suitability for\n> colonization. But they had found little of interest.\n>\n> \"This will be our last recording,\" said the chief scientist in an\n> obscure Galach dialect that Selim found barely comprehensible. He\n> played the log entry five times before he understood the full message.\n>\n> \"Although our assignment is not yet complete, a new transport ship has\n> arrived at the local spaceport. The captain brought an urgent message\n> of\n>\n> turmoil and chaos in the Empire. A junta of tyrants has seized control\n> of our servile thinking machines and used them to take over the\n> galactic government.

We\n> cannot finish our survey work in that time, but if we do not depart\n> now, the continuing turmoil may disrupt travel across the Empire.\"\n>\n> Selim looked at the gathered researchers, with their troubled\n> expressions and distant, glazed-over eyes.\n>\n> \"It may take some time for the political leaders to resolve this\n> dispute and return our lives to normal. None of us wish to be stranded\n> in this awful place, so we will leave with the transport after sealing\n> all systems in our testing stations. Little remains to be discovered\n> in this Arrakis wasteland anyway, but if we ever return, we have made\n> certain that the stations will remain intact and operational, even if\n> the hiatus lasts for a few years.\"\n>\n> As the recording ended, Selim chuckled. \"It has been more than a few\n> years!\"\n>\n> But the images of the long-dead Empire scientists did not respond, and\n> only seemed to stare into the uncharted future.

She must retain all of her strength for one final\n> moment.\n>\n> She heard their crablike warrior-forms skittering down the corridor,\n> ominous sounds of sophisticated machine bodies guided by the brains of\n> human traitors, different from the regimented lockstep of the robotic\n> guards.\n>\n> \"It is almost our time,\" she announced to the fiery-eyed Rossak men,\n> her voice filled with excitement and barely suppressed fear.\n>\n> Skidding to a halt, she arrived within the main chamber where the\n> shielded core of the Omnius manifestation dwelled. Inside the armored\n> room, numerous watcheyes glared at her through glowing optic threads.\n>\n> A voice boomed out from myriad sources. \"Human--- are you wearing a\n> bomb, a pitifully weak explosive that you think can harm me? Did you\n> bring one of your atomics, or is victory not worth such a price to\n> you?\"\n>\n> \"I am not so na\u00efve, Omnius.\" Heoma tossed her sweaty white hair over\n> her shoulder. \"One person cannot possibly harm the great computer\n> evermind.

Heoma's\n> bodyguards turned and opened fire, using the last of their ammunition\n> to cripple one of the neo-cymeks in a single concerted attack.\n>\n> The second neo-cymek raised his integral weapons and vaporized the\n> fearless Rossak men into clouds of bloody pulp. The damaged neo-cymek\n> lay on the floor, its arms and legs twitching like a poisoned insect\n> not yet ready to succumb to death. The larger Titan cymek strode\n> forward.\n>\n> Now Heoma stood alone against the machines. Without moving, she\n> focused her mental powers, building to the point where she could\n> barely maintain even a shred of control.\n>\n> \"I am Barbarossa,\" said the cymek. \"I have squashed so many *hrethgir*\n> that it would take a computer to count them all.\" He and his companion\n> cymek came closer. \"Rarely have I witnessed such arrogance.\"\n>\n> \"Arrogance?

Her screens flickered as the sensors\n> were damaged in the firestorm, and she saw more ships approaching,\n> probably machine reinforcements. A whole squadron.\n>\n> Then louder detonations rang out in the water, and the cymeks began to\n> scramble. Robot vessels exploded, targeted by oncoming kindjals flown\n> by human pilots. She heard a ragged cheer from a woefully small number\n> of voices. The League Armada had sent rescuers to defend the shield\n> facility.\n>\n> Weak with relief, Brigit slumped into her chair, glad that this risky\n> scheme had worked.

While Xavier Harkonnen fought against\n> thinking-machine spaceships in his giant ballistas, he dispatched four\n> javelin destroyers to help secure the surface.

Then he set out with elite search teams to find Serena\n> Butler.\n>\n> He flew directly to the island in the northern sea where commando\n> engineers had restored the shield-generating facility. He expected to\n> find Serena there, since this had been her scheme all along. Xavier\n> looked around, studying the bodies with dread, but saw no sign of\n> Serena or the old veteran Ort Wibsen.

I can't believe she pulled us through.\"\n>\n> Xavier felt ready to melt with relief. \"Where is she?\"\n>\n> \"She's not with the Armada?\" Brigit frowned. \"She left here days ago\n> to intercept your ships and inform you of what we had accomplished.\"\n> She blinked, suddenly disturbed. \"We thought she'd given you all the\n> information.\"\n>\n> \"No, we came because of the message she left me on Salusa.\" Xavier's\n> heart leaped with sudden fear, and his voice dropped to a frigid\n> whisper. \"Something must have happened.

Convoys were airlifting survivors away from the damaged\n> government complex in Giedi City. He hoped Serena was not in there.\n>\n> Ten kilometers above the surface, centered over the citadel that had\n> once been the home of Magnus Sumi, the squadron leveled out, and\n> Xavier knew it was time. Only a few months earlier, in those buildings\n> below, he and his inspection team had been hosted by the Magnus at a\n> banquet.\n>\n> Now Omnius must be excised like a cancer, obliterated from Giedi\n> Prime.\n>\n> Circling over the wounded metropolis, Xavier hesitated. His stomach\n> knotted, and he finally gave the order to his crew. The kindjals\n> disgorged their deadly loads.\n>\n> Xavier closed his eyes, then forced himself to watch the terrible\n> solution. This was the only way to be certain. Even if shreds of the\n> evermind had been distributed in substations around Giedi Prime, the\n> vigorous occupation force would root out any remnants. For now, the\n> humans must annihilate the computer core that cowered like an evil\n> insect queen in the citadel complex, cut off from all its\n> infrastructure, stripped of its machine protectors.\n>\n> Through the tattered smoke and cloud cover, Xavier watched a dozen\n> high-thermal bombs go off, blazing flashes and thunderclaps over the\n> center of Giedi City, vaporizing the government buildings. For blocks\n> around, even stone melted. Steel turned to ash. Glass vaporized.\n> Nothing could survive.\n>\n> A bittersweet victory . . . but victory nonetheless.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> DURING AN INSPECTION tour two days later, Tercero Harkonnen and his\n> line officers documented the decimation of Giedi City. They already\n> knew what they would find, but the harsh evidence sickened them.\n>\n> Xavier took a deep, shuddering breath and tried to salve his\n> conscience by reminding himself that Omnius had been defeated. The\n> humans had taken the planet back.\n>\n> But there was no sign of Serena.\n\n*There is always a way out, if you can recognize it.*\n\n--- VORIAN ATREIDES,\n\ndebriefing files\n\n> **A**s the *Dream Voyager* finally entered the Ophiuchi B solar system\n> as part of the long update run, Seurat attempted to contact the\n> recently installed Omnius network on Giedi Prime.

It\n> would be another great chapter for his father to include in his\n> memoirs.\n>\n> Vorian stood behind the robot captain, studying the instrument console\n> as they approached. \"I'll bet there's still a lot of organizing and\n> restructuring to do down there.\" He was excited at the opportunity to\n> visit a world in the process of shifting from human unruliness to\n> efficient machine rule. Omnius would need to install the best\n> trustees, those most loyal to the thinking machines. Neo-cymeks would\n> probably take care of the brunt of the subjugation work, and trustees\n> would come in later, once the people were sufficiently tamed and\n> accepting of their new situation.\n>\n> But Vor also felt a little peculiar. The conquered *hrethgir* on Giedi\n> Prime would look like him, though he would feel no kinship with them.\n> *Seurat, and others like him, are more like brothers to me.*\n>\n> At the command console, the robot attempted to lock an onboard signal\n> onto a homing beacon from the citadel. \"No contact yet. Perhaps all\n> the systems are not yet installed on the surface, or Agamemnon caused\n> too much damage during his conquest.\"\n>\n> Vor tended to the monitoring systems. \"Damage can always be repaired,\n> once conquest is assured.\" Ahead, Giedi Prime was illuminated on its\n> dayside by a pale yellow sun. As he stared, his brow furrowed with\n> worry. \"Something doesn't seem quite right, Seurat.\"\n>\n> \"Define your reservations, Vorian Atreides. I can take no action based\n> upon a vague uneasy feeling.\"\n>\n> \"Never mind. Just . . . be careful.\"\n>\n> The *Dream Voyager* skimmed the upper atmosphere, slicing through\n> clouds and scattered particulates that the ship's scoop system\n> analyzed as copious smoke. Could the *hrethgir* have been so vicious\n> and desperate that they had burned their own cities? What loathsome\n> creatures!\n>\n> His stomach lurched as onboard warning systems whined. Seurat promptly\n> altered course, halting their descent and gaining altitude again. \"It\n> appears the scrambler field remains intact on Giedi Prime.\"\n>\n> \"We almost flew into it!\" Vor cried. \"Does that mean---\"\n>\n> \"Perhaps General Agamemnon did not succeed in his conquest. Giedi\n> Prime is not as secure as we were led to expect.\"\n>\n> Irrationally confident that his father would not have failed, Vor ran\n> a sequence of scans. \"Instruments picking up League military equipment\n> on the surface, evidence of recent massive explosions in Giedi City.\"\n> The words caught in his throat. \"The central hub and the local Omnius\n> have been obliterated! All robots and cymeks appear to be destroyed as\n> well.\"\n>\n> \"I am scanning their broadband reports . . . collating a summary.\"\n> Without alarm, the robot recounted his understanding of the portable\n> scramblers, the powerful Sorceress of Rossak who had used mental\n> powers to obliterate the cymeks, then the overwhelming force of the\n> League Armada.\n>\n> Then Seurat said in a maddeningly calm voice, \"Vorian, a fleet of\n> *hrethgir* ships is coming around from behind the planet. They appear\n> to have been waiting for us in ambush.\"\n>\n> Outside, streaks of orange and blue tracer fire came close to hitting\n> the update craft, and the *Dream Voyager*'s automatic systems jolted\n> into\n>\n> evasive maneuvers. League kindjals streaked in like wolves. \"They're\n> barbarians,\" Vor said. \"Eager to destroy anything they don't like.\"\n>\n> Seurat said, \"We are under attack. And the *Dream Voyager* is not a\n> combat-programmed vessel.\" He continued to sound artificially jovial,\n> facetiously this time. \"Someday I will think of a joke about why it\n> takes so many humans to short-circuit an Omnius.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> ALERTED TO THE approach of a single thinking-machine vessel, Tercero\n> Xavier Harkonnen had moved his orbital battle group to the far side of\n> the planet. Some wreckage of robot warships still tumbled in a\n> dispersing swath; Omnius's forces had been completely destroyed.\n>\n> Xavier flew out in a personal kindjal, accompanied by a well-armed\n> squadron. He saw the update ship roar on a steep trajectory toward the\n> damaged main city, then swerve desperately upward as soon as the robot\n> captain detected the scrambler fields. \"Follow me! We can't let it get\n> away.\"\n>\n> Hungry for vengeance, his squadron hurled itself into the pursuit. At\n> the same time, he signaled the ground-based military forces that he\n> had an enemy craft in sight. Ahead, wavering in the crosshairs, the\n> *Dream Voyager* surged forward, trying to evade Armada weapons fire\n> and to escape back into space.\n>\n> Abruptly, Xavier was startled to hear a human voice--- or one that\n> *sounded* human--- coming over the comline. \"Hey, break off your\n> attack! This is a League ship. My name is Vorian Atreides. We have\n> boarded a machine craft and taken control. Stop trying to shoot us\n> down!\"\n>\n> Xavier tried to determine from the tenor if it really was a human\n> voice, or only a clever machine copy. Thinking machines were not\n> devious . . . unless there was a preserved cymek brain aboard. Some of\n> the kindjals dropped back, uncertain.\n>\n> \"Stay on your guard,\" Xavier said to his squadron, \"but cease fire\n> until we figure this out---\"\n>\n> Before he could finish his order, the suspicious ship looped and began\n> firing its own weapons, minimal defensive volleys that nevertheless\n> took the Armada fighters by surprise. One kindjal veered away, its\n> engines damaged.\n>\n> Xavier's console screen showed the image of a human face with dark\n> hair and shining fanatical eyes. A sleek, mirror-faced robot stood\n> next to him, his flexible copperfilm body rippling as he operated the\n> controls of the ship.\n>\n> *A human and a robot, working side by side?* Xavier couldn't believe\n> it.\n>\n> \"Open fire!\" he shouted. \"Destroy that ship.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> \"IT IS NOT wise to provoke them too much, Vorian,\" Seurat said,\n> maddeningly calm. \"I would rather leave here posthaste.\"\n>\n> \"I just gained us a few precious seconds, didn't I? You wouldn't have\n> thought of using a bluff.\" Vor couldn't stop grinning. He had read\n> similar words in the memoirs of Agamemnon and was glad to echo them.\n>\n> As the Armada commander took evasive maneuvers and rallied his kindjal\n> pilots, he hurled insults back at Vor on the comline. \"You are a\n> disgrace to humanity, a traitor!\"\n>\n> Vor laughed, proud of his place here. He quoted what he'd been taught\n> all his life. \"I am the pinnacle of humanity--- a trustee of Omnius,\n> the son of General Agamemnon.\"\n>\n> \"I apologize for interrupting your grand speech, Vorian, but I am\n> detecting more *hrethgir* ships,\" the robot said. \"More than we can\n> evade. Therefore, I am breaking off engagement. Our responsibility is\n> to protect the updates aboard. We have to make our report.\"\n>\n> Vor said grimly, \"If the Giedi Prime-- Omnius is already destroyed, we\n> will never have an update of what it did during its months of\n> operation here. We'll never know what he accomplished.\"\n>\n> \"A grievous loss,\" Seurat said.\n>\n> The robot guided the *Dream Voyager* toward orbit, farther from the\n> deadly scrambler fields. The acceleration pressed Vorian back into his\n> padded seat until he nearly lost consciousness. A squadron of\n> human-operated ships closed in on their tail, and the update ship\n> shuddered as an energy pulse hit the aft section.\n>\n> Seurat dodged, and another volley of blows pounded the hull, damaging\n> the armor plates. This vessel was not made to endure such punishment.\n> Vor heard onboard systems hissing, automated routines making temporary\n> repairs to the damaged parts. Another blast hit, even worse than the\n> others.\n>\n> \"We are operating on reserves,\" Seurat announced. Vor scanned the\n> ship's diagnostics himself, assessing the damage. The air in the cabin\n> began to smell acrid and smoky.\n>\n> The *Dream Voyager* lurched. More kindjals surrounded them, targeting\n> their engines. An explosion jarred Vor to his bones.\n>\n> \"We cannot tolerate much more of this,\" Seurat said. \"Our engines are\n> functioning at only a third of normal capacity, and I am flying as\n> fast as I can.\"\n>\n> \"Head into that high cloud,\" Vor said, as an idea suddenly occurred to\n> him. \"The water vapor is thick enough to act as a projection surface.\"\n>\n> Listening to his enthusiastic copilot, Seurat steered into a giant,\n> towering cloud. The damaged engines strained. More blows came from the\n> pursuing kindjals.\n>\n> Vor worked furiously at the controls, using the ship's sophisticated\n> systems to project virtual copies in its wake, electronic images of\n> the *Dream*\n>\n> *Voyager*. He had hoped to use the scheme in a tactical game with\n> Seurat . . . but this was a different sort of game. If it didn't work,\n> the already-damaged update ship would never survive.\n>\n> Moments later a hundred illusory *Dream Voyagers* seemed to surge\n> through the cloud, solido images reflected on the water vapor.\n> Momentarily confused, the pursuing squadron chased decoys.\n>\n> And the real prey limped away, its pilots stealing up into orbit and\n> hoping to remain unnoticed until they could get out of range. . . .\n>\n> *Even the expected can be a terrible shock when we have been holding\n> on to threads of hope.*\n>\n> --- XAVIER HARKONNEN\n>\n> **W**hile the survivors of Giedi Prime counted their dead, documented\n> the damage, and made plans for the future, Xavier felt hope fading. It\n> seemed that no one on the whole world had seen Serena Butler since\n> she'd departed from the island compound in the northern sea.\n>\n> He took twice his normal shifts aboard scout kindjals, flying regular\n> patterns over the settled continents, where thinking machines had\n> caused the most destruction. If Serena was alive, Xavier knew she\n> would never be hiding. Rather, the determined young woman would be in\n> the midst of the hardest work, taking charge as always.\n>\n> Flying eastward on the next scheduled search pattern, he watched the\n> yellow sun set behind him, leaving splashes of gold and orange in its\n> wake. A powerful gust buffeted his craft, and he fought to control it.\n> Xavier rose to a less-turbulent altitude above the jet-stream, while\n> his squadron followed him.\n>\n> Someday, after he and Serena were married, he could tell this story to\n> their children. His chest tightened at the thought, but he continued\n> his search, not daring to consider what he would do if something had\n> happened to her.\n>\n> From this altitude, Xavier could make out the major geographical\n> outlines of continents and seas as they soaked up the approaching\n> night. Through a powerful scope, he saw the center of a city and made\n> out clusters of lights marking human encampments. During their brief\n> and brutal rule, the machine conquerors had slaughtered countless\n> people and sent millions fleeing into the countryside.\n>\n> Now survivors began to filter back to their homes.

Only\n> scraps of twisted, burned-out hardware and an electronic signaling\n> mechanism remained.\n>\n> But full recovery would take a great deal of time.\n>\n> Xavier hated machines more than anything, but he also believed in\n> honor among men. He could not understand the turncoat Vorian Atreides,\n> who willingly flew beside a robot captain in a thinking-machine spy\n> ship. Brainwashed, obviously, but something in the young man's\n> arrogant demeanor suggested deep convictions . . . a fanatical,\n> single-minded passion. Atreides had claimed to be the \"son\" of\n> Agamemnon, the worst of the cymek Titans.\n>\n> Below, one of the squadron ships veered toward the water in the vast,\n> open sea. \"Tercero Harkonnen, I'm detecting debris in the water below.\n> Metallic wreckage of some sort.\"\n>\n> With sudden dread, Xavier said, \"Check it out.\"\n>\n> Two kindjals swooped down to the open sea. One pilot transmitted, \"The\n> mass and configuration suggests that it's the remains of a League ship\n> with military-grade armor. Maybe a blockade runner.\"\n>\n> \"Did we lose any ships of that type in our engagement?\" \"No, sir.\"\n>\n> \"Retrieve the wreckage,\" Xavier commanded, surprised at how steady his\n> voice sounded. \"We'll run an analysis.\" He didn't want to say it, but\n> knew that Serena and her team had taken such a craft out onto the open\n> sea, when departing from the transmitter facility.\n>\n> He thought of the shimmering image of Serena projected from the black\n> diamond necklace that Octa had given him. The memory was so sharp that\n> the achingly beautiful woman seemed to be standing in front of him\n> again,\n>\n> proud and determined with her misguided idea of helping the people of\n> Giedi Prime.\n>\n> As the crews gathered the scattered debris, Xavier saw that the hull\n> had been painted an unobtrusive gray with a film of stealth coating,\n> now blistered and peeled.\n>\n> He felt numb. \"We have to make certain, one way or the other.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> LATER, WHEN THE debris had been delivered to a temporary military\n> encampment in Giedi City, Xavier Harkonnen ordered a full examination\n> on any traces found in the interior of the destroyed craft.

All doubt dissipated. This had been Serena's vessel.\n>\n> They found more blood inside the waterlogged ship. Obviously they had\n> put up an extraordinary fight at the end. Xavier ran full DNA scans,\n> hoping for any result other than the one he feared most.\n>\n> But the results proved that the other victims had been the Home Guard\n> messenger Pinquer Jibb . . . and Serena Butler herself.\n>\n> *Serena.

He separated out a\n> muscular, mahogany-skinned man for assignment to the Ajax pedestal\n> project, smiling encouragement to him, then dispatched others to crews\n> that required more manpower.\n>\n> One of the last to emerge from the ship was a battered woman who,\n> despite the dark bruises on her face and arms and the weary shock in\n> her expression, carried herself with pride, showing internal strength\n> in every movement. This was the one for Erasmus. *Trouble*.\n>\n> Why would the robot be interested in her? He would probably just\n> vivisect her anyway. A waste. And a shame.\n>\n> Iblis called to her, but she ignored his gentle yet authoritative\n> tone. Finally, with some rough encouragement from the guard robots,\n> she stood in front of him. Though only of average height, the female\n> had striking lavender eyes, amber-brown hair, and a face that might be\n> pretty if cleansed of grime and anger.\n>\n> He smiled warmly, trying to reach out to her with a little charm. \"The\n> records say your name is Serena Linn\u00e9?\" He knew full well who she was.\n>\n> Iblis stared into her eyes and detected a spark of defiance there. She\n> held his gaze, as if she were his equal. \"Yes. My father was a minor\n> official in Giedi City, moderately well-off.\"\n>\n> \"Have you ever worked as a servant before?\" he inquired.\n>\n> \"I have always been a servant--- of the people.\"\n>\n> \"From now on, you serve Omnius.\" He softened his voice. \"I promise\n> you, it won't be so bad. Our workers are treated well here. Especially\n> intelligent ones like yourself.

Serena Butler?\"\n>\n> She glared at him. At least she didn't deny it. \"How did you know?\"\n>\n> \"After capturing you, Barbarossa inspected the wreckage of your\n> vessel. There were many clues aboard. You are fortunate the cymeks\n> never needed to interrogate you in further detail.\" He glanced at his\n> electronic notes. \"We know you are the daughter of Viceroy Manion\n> Butler.

On the inland side, the main building loomed high\n> in front of a lovely flagstone square beneath high turrets; toward the\n> coast, a cluster of bleak, crowded slave pens huddled on the opposite\n> side, where human captives lived like livestock.\n>\n> From the highest balconies, the robot found the dichotomy curious.\n>\n> Forming his metal polymer facefilm into a paternal mask, Erasmus\n> watched as two sentinel robots strode through a slave pen, hunting for\n> twin girls that he required for a new round of experiments. The\n> panicked humans scrambled away, but Erasmus didn't shift his pliable\n> face into a frown. His myriad optic threads scanned the lean and dirty\n> forms, assessing.\n>\n> He had seen the little girls a few days before, noting their short\n> black hair and brown eyes, but they seemed to be hiding somewhere.\n> Playing a game with him? The sentinels tore through a doorway into a\n> tunnel that led to another pen; finally, they transmitted back, \"We\n> have located the two subjects.\"\n>\n> *Good*, Erasmus thought, anticipating the intriguing work ahead. He\n> wanted to see if he could force one of the twin girls to kill the\n> other. It would be a landmark experiment, one that would reveal\n> important insights into moral boundaries and how siblings defined\n> them.\n>\n> He especially enjoyed working with identical twins. Over the years he\n> had processed dozens of pairs through his laboratory, compiling\n> detailed medical reports as well as intensive psychological studies.\n> He spent a great\n>\n> deal of effort on meticulous comparative autopsies, microanalyzing the\n> subtle differences in siblings who were genetic carbon-copies. The\n> slave masters working in the crowded pens had instructions to identify\n> and select any new sets among the captive populace on Earth.\n>\n> Finally, the squirming dark-haired twins stood in front of him, held\n> by the sentinel robots. He shifted his pliable facefilm into a calm\n> smile. One of the girls spat on the reflective surface. Erasmus\n> wondered why saliva carried such a negative connotation for humans? It\n> caused no damage and could be cleaned off easily. The forms of human\n> defiance never ceased to amaze him.\n>\n> Shortly before Erasmus had left his estate on Corrin, twenty-two\n> slaves had removed their protective eye films and intentionally stared\n> into the furious red-giant sun, blinding themselves. Disobedient,\n> resistant--- and stupid. What did the rebellious act accomplish, other\n> than rendering them useless for slave work?\n>\n> They had expected to be killed, and Erasmus would oblige them. But not\n> so that they could become martyrs. Instead, he had quietly separated\n> them from other workers to prevent the spread of their unruliness.\n> Blinded, they could not find or earn food. By now, he supposed they\n> must have starved in their self-inflicted darkness.\n>\n> Still, he had marveled at their spirit, their collective will to\n> challenge him. Even though humans were a troublesome breed, they were\n> constantly fascinating.\n>\n> A watcheye buzzed nearby, making strange, raw noises. Finally, Omnius\n> spoke through it. \"The recent loss of Giedi Prime is your fault,\n> Erasmus. I tolerate your endless experiments in the hope that you will\n> deconstruct and analyze human behavior. Why did you not predict the\n> suicidal raid that obliterated my cymeks? The data and experiences of\n> my Giedi Prime counterpart were never backed up. Barbarossa is equally\n> irreplaceable, since he created my original programming.\"\n>\n> The Earth-Omnius already knew about the recapture of Giedi Prime\n> because of an automated emergency buoy launched by the robot Seurat,\n> whose update ship had unexpectedly encountered the disaster in its\n> duties. The alarming message had reached Earth only that morning.\n>\n> \"I was not given data that the Sorceresses of Rossak had developed\n> this capability of telepathic destruction.\" The robot's face shimmered\n> back into its blank oval smoothness. \"Why not also ask your questions\n> of Vorian Atreides when he returns to Earth? The son of Agamemnon has\n> helped us to simulate unstable human behavior before.\"\n>\n> Omnius said, \"Even his input could not have prepared us for what\n> happened to Giedi Prime. Sentient biologicals are unpredictable and\n> reckless.\"\n>\n> As the sentinel robots dragged the squirming twins away, Erasmus\n> directed his attention to the watcheye. \"Then it is obvious I have\n> more work to do.\"\n>\n> \"No, Erasmus, it is obvious that your research is not yielding the\n> desired results. You should strive for perfection, rather than\n> investigating compounded errors. I recommend that you overwrite your\n> mind core with a subset of my program. Turn yourself into a perfect\n> machine. A copy of me.\"\n>\n> \"You would sacrifice our fascinating, open-ended debates?\" Erasmus\n> responded, fighting to conceal his inner alarm. \"You have always\n> expressed an interest in my peculiar manner of thinking. All the\n> everminds especially look forward to your record of my actions.\"\n>\n> The buzzing of the watcheye intensified, indicating that Omnius was\n> shifting his thought pathways. This was a worrisome, volatile\n> situation. Erasmus did not want to lose his carefully developed\n> independent identity.\n>\n> One of the twin girls tried to break away from the robotic guards and\n> run back toward the dubious safety of the pens. As Erasmus had\n> suggested beforehand, the guard lifted her sister by one arm, leaving\n> her to dangle screaming. The free twin hesitated, though she could\n> easily have reached the temporary shelter. Slowly, she came to a stop,\n> surrendering.\n>\n> *Fascinating*, Erasmus thought. And the sentinel robot did not even\n> have to inflict cellular damage on the other girl.\n>\n> Thinking quickly, the robot said, \"Perhaps if I diverted my attention\n> to matters of military significance, you would more easily see the\n> potential of my work. Let me understand the mentality of these wild\n> humans for you. What drives them to such self-sacrifice, as we\n> witnessed on Giedi Prime? If I can distill an explanation, your\n> Synchronized Worlds will no longer be vulnerable to unpredictable\n> attacks.\"\n>\n> The watcheye hovered as a million possibilities showered through the\n> abundant mind of Omnius. Presently, the computer made his decision.\n> \"You have my permission to proceed. But do not continue to test my\n> patience.\"\n>\n> *People require continuity.*\n\n--- BOVKO MANRESA,\n\nFirst Viceroy of the League of Nobles\n\n> **O**n Poritrin, the virulent fever raced through the mudflats and\n> docks where slaves made their dreary homes. Despite the best\n> quarantine and mitigation efforts, the disease killed a number of\n> officials and merchants, and even spread as far as the slaves in Tio\n> Holtzman's blufftop laboratories, where it caused quite a disruption\n> in the scientist's work.\n>\n> When Holtzman first noticed symptoms of the illness among his crowded\n> equation solvers, he immediately ordered removal of the sick ones to\n> isolation chambers and sealed off the remainder of the calculating\n> teams. The distracted Savant thought the slaves would rejoice at being\n> relieved of their mathematical chores; instead the solvers moaned and\n> prayed, asking why the hand of God would strike *them* rather than\n> their oppressors.\n>\n> Within two weeks, half of his household slaves had either died or been\n> quarantined. Such a shift in daily routines was not conducive to the\n> Savant's mental work.\n>\n> Several large-scale simulations had been under way, following the\n> gradual development of parameters established by the talented Norma\n> Cenva. Groaning at the inconvenience, Holtzman knew that stopping the\n> lengthy work in midstream would necessitate new teams to start over\n> again. To maintain his stature, he needed a major breakthrough soon.\n>\n> Lately his reputation had been supported more by Norma's work than his\n> own. Naturally, he had taken full credit for modifying the\n> scrambler-field generators into an offensive weapon. Lord Bludd had\n> delighted in presenting two prototypes to the Armada liberation force\n> for Giedi Prime. Indeed, the scrambler projectors had served the\n> rescuers well, but the prototypes had consumed enough energy to ground\n> two troop transports, and the devices themselves had broken down---\n> irreparably--- after only one\n>\n> use. In addition, the disruptive pulse had yielded uneven results,\n> since many robots had been shielded by walls or unaffected by the\n> dissipating field. Still, the idea showed promise, and the nobles\n> urged Holtzman to work on improvements, without ever knowing about\n> Norma's involvement.\n>\n> At least Holtzman's reputation was secure again. For a while.\n>\n> Norma was quiet but diligent. Rarely interested in diversions or\n> amusements, she worked hard and scrutinized her own ideas. Despite\n> Holtzman's wishes, she insisted on performing most calculations\n> personally rather than handing them off to solver teams. Norma was too\n> independent to understand the economics of delegating tasks. Her\n> dedication made her a rather dull person.\n>\n> After rescuing the young prodigy from her obscurity on Rossak, he had\n> hoped, unrealistically perhaps, that Norma might provide him with\n> sudden inspiration. During a recent cocktail party in Lord Bludd's\n> conical towers, the nobleman had made a joke about Holtzman taking a\n> holiday from his usual brilliance. Though the comment had stung, the\n> inventor had laughed along with the other tittering nobles. Still, it\n> high-lighted--- in his own mind, at least--- that he had not created\n> anything really original in some time.\n>\n> Following a restless night of bizarre dreams, Holtzman finally came up\n> with a concept to explore. Expanding some of the electromagnetic\n> features he had used for his scrambler fields, he might be able to\n> create an \"alloy resonance generator.\" Properly tuned, a thermal-field\n> inducer would couple with metals--- the bodies of robots, for\n> instance, or even the crablike warrior-forms worn by cymeks. Given the\n> correct adjustment, the resonance generator could slam selected metal\n> atoms against each other, generating enormous heat until the machine\n> shook itself apart.\n>\n> The concept seemed promising. Holtzman intended to pursue its\n> development with full enthusiasm and haste.\n>\n> But first he needed more solvers and assistants to construct the\n> prototype. And now he had to waste a day on the mundane task of\n> replacing the\n>\n> household slaves that had died from the fever. With a frustrated sigh,\n> he left his laboratories and trudged down the zigzag trail to the base\n> of the bluffs, where he caught a jetboat across the river.\n>\n> On the opposite shore, at the widest part of the delta, he visited a\n> bustling river market. Rafts and barges had been lashed together for\n> so long that they might well have been part of the landscape. The\n> merchants'quarter was not far from the Starda spaceport, where vendors\n> provided offworld oddities: drugs from Rossak, interesting woods and\n> plants from Ecaz, gems from Hagal, musical instruments from Chusuk.\n>\n> In shops that fronted a narrow alley, tailors were copying the latest\n> Salusan fashions, cutting and sewing exotic imported cloths and fine\n> Poritrin linens. Holtzman had used many of these garment makers to\n> enhance his personal wardrobe. An eminent Savant such as himself could\n> not spend all of his time in the laboratories. After all, he was\n> frequently called upon to make public appearances to answer questions\n> from citizens and often spoke before committees of nobles, to convince\n> them of his continued importance.\n>\n> But today Holtzman made his way farther out onto the floating rafts\n> and barges. He needed to purchase people, not clothes. The scientist\n> saw a sign on the dock ahead, in Galach:HUMAN RESOURCES. He crossed\n> creaking boardwalks and gangplanks to a cluster of rafts that held\n> captives. Grouped in lots behind barricades, the sullen prisoners were\n> dressed in drab, identical uniforms, many of which fit badly. The\n> slaves were lean and angular, as if unaccustomed to eating regular\n> meals. These men and women came from planets that few of the free\n> citizens of Poritrin had ever heard of, much less visited.\n>\n> Their handlers seemed aloof, not particularly eager to show off wares\n> or haggle over prices. After the recent plague, many households and\n> estates needed to replace their personnel, and it was a\n> sellers'market.\n>\n> Other customers crowded against the railings, scrutinizing the\n> downcast faces, inspecting the merchandise. One old man clutching a\n> wad of credits\n>\n> summoned the tender and asked for a closer look at four middle-aged\n> females.\n>\n> Holtzman was not particularly picky, nor did he want to waste time.\n>\n> Since he needed so many slaves, he intended to buy an entire lot. Once\n> they arrived at his blufftop estate, he would choose the most\n> intelligent ones to work calculations, while the remainder would cook,\n> clean, or maintain his household.\n>\n> He hated these menial shopping duties, but had never delegated them in\n> the past. He smiled, realizing he had been critical of Norma for doing\n> the very same thing, for her failure to use solvers.\n>\n> Impatient and eager, Holtzman summoned the nearest handler, waving\n> Niko Bludd's credit authorization and pushing himself to the front. \"I\n> want a large order of slaves.\"\n>\n> The Human Resources merchant bustled over, grinning and bowing. \"Of\n> course, Savant Holtzman! What you require, I shall provide. Simply\n> specify your needs, and I will provide a competitive quotation.\"\n>\n> Suspicious that the merchant might try to cheat him, he said, \"I need\n> slaves that are smart and independent, but capable of following\n> instructions. Seventy or eighty will do, I suppose.\" Some of the\n> customers pushing close to the railing grumbled, but did not challenge\n> the celebrity inventor.\n>\n> \"Quite a demand,\" the vendor said, \"especially in these lean times.\n> The plague has created a shortage, until the Tlulaxa flesh merchants\n> deliver more.\"\n>\n> \"Everyone knows how important--- and *essential*--- my work is,\"\n> Holtzman said, pointedly removing a chronometer from the wide sleeve\n> of his white robe. \"My needs take precedence over some rich citizen\n> looking to replace a house cleaner. If you like, I will obtain a\n> special dispensation from Lord Bludd.\"\n>\n> \"I know you can do that, Savant,\" said the slave tender. He shouted at\n> the other customers pushing forward. \"All of you, quit your\n> complaining! Without this man, we'd be sweeping the floors for\n> thinking machines right now!\" Putting on another face, the handler\n> smiled back at Holtzman. \"The question, of course, is which slaves\n> would best serve you? I have a new batch just delivered from\n> Harmonthep: Zensunnis, all of them. Suitably docile, but I'm afraid\n> they go for a premium.\"\n>\n> Holtzman frowned. He preferred to use his finances in other ways,\n> especially considering the large investment that would be necessary\n> for his new alloy-resonator concept. \"Do not attempt to take advantage\n> of me, sir.\"\n>\n> The man reddened, but held his ground, sensing that the inventor was\n> in a hurry. \"Perhaps another group would be more suitable then? I have\n> some just in from IV Anbus.\" He gestured to a separate raft where\n> dark-haired slaves stared out with hostile expressions, challenging\n> the customers. \"They are Zenshiites.\"\n>\n> \"What's the difference? Are they less expensive?\"\n>\n> \"A simple matter of religious philosophy.\" The slave merchant waited\n> for some recognition, didn't see it, then smiled with relief. \"Who can\n> understand the Buddislamics, anyway? They're workers, and that's what\n> you need, right? I can sell you these Zenshiites for a lower price,\n> even though they're quite intelligent. Probably better educated than\n> the Harmonthep lot. They're healthy, too. I have medical\n> certifications. Not one of them has been exposed to the plague virus.\"\n>\n> Holtzman perused the group. They all had rolled up their left sleeves,\n> as if it were some kind of badge. Up front, a muscular man with fiery\n> eyes and a thick black beard gazed back at him dispassionately, as if\n> he considered himself superior to those who held him captive.\n>\n> With his cursory inspection, Holtzman could see nothing wrong with the\n> IV Anbus captives. His household was desperately understaffed, and his\n> laboratories needed more low-level technicians. Every day it was a\n> struggle\n>\n> to find enough solvers to work through the increasingly complex sets\n> of equations.\n>\n> \"But why are they cheaper?\" he persisted.\n>\n> \"They are more plentiful. It's a simple matter of supply and demand.\"\n> The slave vendor held his gaze. He named a price.\n>\n> Too impatient to haggle for the best deal, Holtzman nodded. \"I'll take\n> eighty of them.\" He raised his voice. \"I don't care if they're from IV\n> Anbus or Harmonthep. They're on Poritrin now, and they work for Savant\n> Tio Holtzman.\"\n>\n> The crafty slave merchant turned to the group of captives and shouted.\n> \"You hear that? You should be proud.\"\n>\n> The dark-haired captives simply looked back at their new master,\n> saying nothing. Holtzman was relieved. That probably meant they would\n> be more tractable.\n>\n> He transferred the correct amount of credits. \"See that they are\n> cleaned up and sent to my residence.\"\n>\n> The grinning slave handler thanked him profusely. \"Don't you worry,\n> Savant Holtzman. You'll be satisfied with this lot.\"\n>\n> As the great man left the crowded river market, other customers began\n> to shout and wave their credit vouchers, squabbling over the remaining\n> slaves. It promised to be a furious day of bidding.\n\n*Over the course of history, the stronger species invariably wins.*\n\n--- TLALOC,\n\n*A Time for Titans*\n\n> **A**fter taking refuge in the Arrakis wasteland, the Zensunni\n> Wanderers were little more than scavengers, and not very brave. Even\n> on their most distant excursions to collect useful items, the nomads\n> remained close to the rocks, avoiding the deep desert and the demon\n> worms.\n>\n> Long ago, after the Imperial chemist Shakkad the Wise had remarked on\n> the rejuvenating properties of the obscure spice melange, there had\n> been a small market for the natural substance among offworlders at the\n> Arrakis City spaceport. However, the planet's distance from popular\n> spacing lanes had never made melange an economically attractive item.\n> \"An oddity, not a commodity,\" one surly merchant had told Naib\n> Dhartha. Still, spice was a staple in the food supply, and it must be\n> gathered . . . but only on sands close to the rocks.\n>\n> Dhartha led a party of six across a ridge of packed powder sand that\n> held their footprints as if they were kisses in the dust. Loose white\n> cloths around their heads and faces exposed only their eyes; their\n> cloaks blew in the breeze, revealing equipment belts, tools, and\n> weapons. Dhartha snugged the cloth higher over his nose to keep from\n> breathing grit. He scratched the tattoo etched so painstakingly onto\n> his cheek, then narrowed his eyes, always alert for danger.\n>\n> No one thought to watch the clear morning skies until they heard a\n> faint whistle growing quickly into a howl. To Naib Dhartha, it sounded\n> like a woman who had just learned of her husband's death.\n>\n> Looking up, he saw a silvery bullet that tore through the atmosphere,\n> then recognized the unexpected hum and whine of thrusters. A\n> bubble-shaped object plummeted through the sky, spun about and\n> see-sawed in the open air as if choosing a place to land. Quad engines\n> slowed its descent. Then, less\n>\n> than a kilometer from where the scavenging party stood, the object\n> slammed into the dunes like a fist thumping into the stomach of a\n> dishonest merchant. A spray of dust and sand shot upward, embracing a\n> tendril of dark soot.\n>\n> The Naib stood stiffly and stared, while his men began to jabber\n> excitedly. Young Ebrahim was as enthralled as Dhartha's own son,\n> Mahmad; both boys wanted to race out and investigate.\n>\n> Mahmad was a good lad, respectful and cautious. But Dhartha had a low\n> opinion of Ebrahim, who liked to tell stories and talk of imaginary\n> exploits. Then there was the incident in which tribal water had been\n> stolen, an unforgivable crime. Initially the Naib had thought two boys\n> were involved, Ebrahim and Selim. But Ebrahim had been quick to\n> disavow any responsibility and to point the finger at the other boy.\n> Selim had seemed shocked at the accusation, but had not denied it.\n>\n> In addition, Ebrahim's father had stepped forward to make a generous\n> deal with Dhartha to save his son . . . and so the orphan boy had\n> received the ultimate sentence of banishment. Not much of a loss to\n> the tribe. A Naib often had to make such difficult decisions.\n>\n> Now, as the scavengers looked at Dhartha, their bright eyes glinting\n> between folds of dirty white cloth, he knew he could not ignore the\n> opportunity of this crashed ship, whatever it was. \"We must go see\n> this thing,\" he called.\n>\n> His men rushed across the sands, boisterous Ebrahim and Mahmad in the\n> lead, hurrying toward the pillar of dust that marked the impact.\n> Dhartha did not like to stray far from the sheltering rock, but the\n> desert beckoned them toward a rich, alien treasure.\n>\n> The nomads crested one dune, slid down the slipface, and scurried up\n> another. By the time they reached the impact crater, they were all\n> winded, panting hot breaths that were smothered by the cloths over\n> their mouths. The Naib and his men stood on the high lip of excavated\n> sand. Glassy smears of superheated silica had splattered like saliva\n> on the ground.\n>\n> Inside the pit lay a mechanical object the size of two men, with\n> protrusions and components that hummed and moved, awakening now that\n> it had landed. The carbon fiber-encased body still smoked from the\n> heat of reentry. A spacecraft, perhaps?\n>\n> One of Dhartha's men stepped back, making a warding sign with his\n> fingers. Overzealous Ebrahim, though, bent forward. The Naib put a\n> hand on Mahmad's left arm, cautioning his son. Let the foolish one\n> take the risks.\n>\n> The crashed pod was too small to carry passengers. The lights blinked\n> brighter, and the probe's sides opened like dragon wings to expose\n> mechanical limbs, articulated claws, and complex machinery inside.\n> Scanners, processors, engines of investigation and destruction.\n> Mirrorlike power converters spread out in the glare of the sun.\n>\n> Ebrahim slid down the churned sand at the edge of the pit. \"Imagine\n> what this would be worth at the spaceport, Naib! If I get to it first,\n> I should receive the largest salvage share.\"\n>\n> Dhartha wanted to argue with the exuberant youth, but when he saw that\n> no one--- except for his own son--- looked eager to join Ebrahim, he\n> nodded. \"If successful, you'll get an extra share.\" Even if the\n> falling object was completely ruined, the nomads could work the pure\n> metal for their own purposes.\n>\n> The brash young man stopped halfway down the loose slope, looking\n> suspiciously at the device, which continued to vibrate and thump.\n> Flexible components extruded arms and legs, while strange lenses and\n> mirrors rotated at the ends of flexible carbon fiber tentacles. The\n> probe seemed to be assessing its surroundings, as if it didn't\n> comprehend where it had landed.\n>\n> The machine paid no attention to the surreptitious humans, until\n> Ebrahim dug a stone from the slumping side of the crater. He called\n> out \"Ai! Ai!\" then hurled the rock. It struck the composite material\n> of the probe's side with an echoing *clunk*.\n>\n> The mechanical lander froze, then turned its lenses and scanners\n> toward the human standing all alone. Ebrahim hunched on bent knees in\n> the yielding sand.\n>\n> Blinding hot light erupted from one of the lenses. A gout of coherent\n> fire engulfed Ebrahim and blew him backward in a crackling cloud of\n> incinerated flesh and bones. A wad of smoldering garments struck the\n> top of the crater, along with charred pieces of his hands and feet.\n>\n> Mahmad screamed for his friend, and Dhartha immediately yelled for the\n> men to retreat. They stumbled back down the outside of the crater and\n> fled through the soft gully between dunes. Half a kilometer away,\n> safe, they climbed to a sandy crest high enough that they could look\n> back toward the pit. The men prayed and made superstitious gestures,\n> and Dhartha raised his clenched right fist. Foolish Ebrahim had drawn\n> the attention of the mechanical thing and had paid with his life.\n>\n> From a distance, the would-be scavengers watched. The crashed probe\n> paid them no further heed. Instead, with thumping and clattering, the\n> machine seemed to be assembling itself, building structures around its\n> core. Scooping hands drew sand into a resource-production hopper in\n> its belly and extruded glasslike rods that it used for structural\n> supports. The machine added new components, building itself larger,\n> and finally began digging its way out of the pit. It pounded and\n> hammered, making a great deal of racket.\n>\n> Dhartha remained perplexed. Though he was a leader, he had no idea\n> what to do. Such a thing was beyond his ken. Perhaps someone at the\n> spaceport would know, but he hated to rely on outworlders. Besides,\n> this thing might be valuable, and he didn't want to surrender his\n> salvage.\n>\n> \"Father, look.\" Mahmad gestured toward the wasteland of sand. \"See,\n> that machine demon will pay for killing my friend.\"\n>\n> Dhartha saw the telltale ripple, the stirring of a behemoth beneath\n> the sands. The crashed probe continued its pounding, rhythmic motion\n> with a clattering of components, oblivious to its surroundings. The\n> assembled mechanism raised itself, a monstrous composite of\n> crystalline materials and\n>\n> silica struts reinforced by carbon-fiber beams converted from its own\n> hull and support girders.\n>\n> The sandworm came in fast, tunneling just beneath the surface until\n> its head rose up. The mouth was a huge shovel larger than the impact\n> crater.\n>\n> The robotic probe waved its sensor arms and weapons lenses, sensing it\n> was being attacked, but not understanding how. Several white-hot\n> blasts of fire penetrated the loose ground.\n>\n> The worm swallowed the mechanical demon whole. Then the sinuous desert\n> creature burrowed beneath the dust again like a sea serpent seeking\n> deeper waters. . . .\n>\n> Naib Dhartha and his men remained petrified on the dunes. If they\n> turned and ran now, their vibrations would call the sandworm back for\n> another meal.\n>\n> Soon enough, they saw the worm trail heading outward, returning to the\n> deep desert. The crater was gone, along with all evidence of the\n> mechanical construction. Not even a scrap of foolish Ebrahim's body\n> remained.\n>\n> Shaking his head with its long black ponytail, Dhartha turned to his\n> shocked companions. \"This will make a legendary story, a magnificent\n> ballad to be sung in our caves in the dark of night. . . .\" He drew a\n> deepbreath and turned around. \"Though I doubt anyone will ever believe\n> us.\"\n>\n> *The future?

Unless vital matters intervened, his father always\n> came to greet him. These were rare moments they had together, when\n> they could exchange ideas, talk about plans and dreams. Vor comforted\n> himself with the thought that Agamemnon probably had important\n> business for Omnius.\n>\n> Robotic maintenance crews and repair machinery trundled forward to\n> inspect the damaged ship. One of the multicomponent machines paused in\n> its assessment, broke away, and hummed toward him. \"Vorian Atreides,\n> Agamemnon has commanded you to meet him in the conditioning facility.\n> Report there immediately.\"\n>\n> The young human brightened. Letting the robot return to its work, he\n> walked off briskly. When he could contain himself no longer, he began\n> to run. . . .\n>\n> Though he attempted to exercise during the long voyages with Seurat,\n> Vor's biological muscles were weaker than a machine's, and he tired\n> quickly. Another reminder of his mortality, his fragility, and the\n> inferiority of natural biology. It only increased his desire to wear a\n> powerful neo-cymek body someday and discard this imperfect human form.\n>\n> His lungs burning, Vor rushed into the gleaming chrome-and-plaz\n> chamber where his father's brain canister was regularly polished and\n> recharged with electrafluid. As soon as the young man entered the\n> cold, well-lit room, two robot guards folded in behind him, ominously\n> blocking egress. In the center of the chamber stood a mechanical,\n> human-shaped colossus that Agamemnon now wore. The behemoth took two\n> steps forward, stabilizer-feet hammering against the hard floor. He\n> dwarfed his son, towering three times Vorian's height.\n>\n> \"I have been waiting for you, my son. Everything is prepared. What\n> caused your delay?\"\n>\n> Intimidated, Vor looked up at the preservation canister. \"I hurried\n> here, Father. My ship landed only an hour ago.\"\n>\n> \"I understand the *Dream Voyager* was damaged at Giedi Prime, attacked\n> by the human rebels that murdered Barbarossa and recaptured the\n> world.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, sir.\" Vor knew better than to waste the Titan's time with\n> unnecessary details. The general would already have received a full\n> report. \"I will answer any questions you might have, Father.\"\n>\n> \"I have no questions, only *commands*.\" Instead of instructing his son\n> to begin the process of grooming and polishing his components,\n> Agamemnon raised a gauntleted hand, clutched Vorian by the chest, and\n> pushed him forcefully against an upright table.\n>\n> Vor was slammed against the smooth surface and felt a burst of pain.\n> His father was so powerful that he could accidentally break bones,\n> sever the spine. \"What is it, Father? What---\"\n>\n> Holding him immobile, Agamemnon clamped on wrist bindings, a waist\n> restraint, and ankle cuffs. Helpless now, Vor twisted his head to look\n> at what his father was doing and saw that complex devices had been\n> brought into the chamber. With trepidation he noted hollow cylinders\n> filled with bluish fluids, neuromechanical pumps, and chittering\n> machines that waved questing sensor tips in the air.\n>\n> \"Please, Father.\" Vor's deepest fears careened through his mind,\n> ricocheting off the pain, each impact increasing his doubts and\n> terrors. \"What have I done wrong?\"\n>\n> Showing no readable expression on his head turret, Agamemnon extended\n> an array of long needles toward his son's squirming body. The steel\n> points penetrated his chest, poking between his ribs, seeking out and\n> finding his lungs, his heart. Two silver shafts pierced his throat.\n> Blood oozed out everywhere. Vor's neck sinews bulged as he clenched\n> his jaw and curled back his lips, biting back a scream.\n>\n> But the scream broke through anyway.\n>\n> The cymek manipulated the machinery connected to Vorian's body,\n> increasing the pain beyond all imaginable levels. Convinced that he\n> had failed somehow, Vor assumed it was his time to die--- like the\n> twelve unknown brothers who had preceded him. Now, it seemed, Vorian\n> had not lived up to Agamemnon's expectations.\n>\n> Agony swelled higher, with no crest in sight. His scream became a\n> prolonged wail, as acid-colored fluids were pumped into his body. Soon\n> even his vocal cords gave out, and his shriek continued only in his\n> mind . . .\n>\n> yet it continued nevertheless. He could endure no more. He could not\n> imagine the grievous injury his stretched and torn body must already\n> have endured.\n>\n> When finally the torture concluded and Vor came back to himself, he\n> didn't know how long he had been unconscious--- perhaps even lost in\n> the cloak of death. His body felt as if it had been crushed into a\n> ball and then stretched back into the form of a man.\n>\n> The colossus shape of Agamemnon loomed over him, a galaxy of optic\n> threads glittering on his body. Even though the remnants of\n> excruciating pain echoed inside his skull, Vor resisted crying out.\n> His father had kept him alive after all, for his own reasons. He\n> stared into the Titan's implacable metal face and could only hope that\n> his father had not revived him just to inflict more agony.\n>\n> *What have I done wrong?*\n>\n> Yet the ancient cymek did not have murder on his mind. Instead he\n> said, \"I am exceedingly pleased with your actions aboard the *Dream\n> Voyager*, Vorian. I have analyzed Seurat's report and determined that\n> your tactical prowess in escaping from the League Armada was\n> innovative and unexpected.\"\n>\n> Vorian couldn't understand the context of his father's words. They\n> seemed unrelated to the tortures the general had inflicted on him.\n>\n> \"No thinking machine would have considered such a deceitful trick. I\n> doubt even another trustee would have been so quick to think of the\n> ruse. In fact, Omnius's summation concludes that any other action\n> would likely have resulted in the capture or destruction of the *Dream\n> Voyager*. Seurat would never have been capable of surviving by\n> himself. You not only saved the ship, you saved the Omnius update\n> spheres and returned them intact.\" Agamemnon paused, then reiterated.\n> \"Yes, I am exceedingly pleased, my son. You have the potential of\n> becoming a great cymek someday.\"\n>\n> Vor's raw throat convulsed as he tried to force out words. The\n> needle-studded cradle had been yanked away, and now Agamemnon released\n> the body restraints that held him against the hard surface. Vorian's\n> watery muscles could not support him, and he drooped like a rag,\n> sliding down until he pooled on his knees on the floor. Finally he\n> choked, \"Then why was I tortured? Why have you punished me?\"\n>\n> Agamemnon simulated a laugh. \"When I choose to punish you, son, you\n> will know. That was a *reward*. Omnius allowed me to grant you this\n> rare\n>\n> gift. In fact, no other human in all the Synchronized Worlds has been\n> so honored.\"\n>\n> \"But how, Father? Please explain it to me. My mind is still\n> throbbing.\" His voice hitched.\n>\n> \"What are a few moments of pain, in comparison with the gift you have\n> received?\" The colossus paced back and forth across the sparkling\n> maintenance room, shaking the floor and the walls. \"Unfortunately, I\n> was unable to convince Omnius to convert you into a neo-cymek--- you\n> are too young--- but I am sure the time will come. I wanted you to\n> serve at my side\n>\n> --- more than a trustee, but as my true successor.\" His sparkling\n> optic threads glowed brighter. \"Instead, I have done the next best\n> thing for you.\"\n>\n> The cymek general explained that he had given Vorian a rigorous\n> biotech treatment, a cellular replacement system that would\n> dramatically extend his life as a human. \"Geriatric specialists\n> developed the technique in the Old Empire . . . though to what purpose\n> I cannot fathom. Those oafs did nothing productive during their normal\n> lifespans, so why should they want to live for centuries longer and\n> accomplish even less? Through new proteins, rejection of free\n> radicals, more efficient cellular repair mechanisms, they prolonged\n> their pointless existences. Most of them were murdered in the\n> rebellions when we Titans cemented our control.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon swiveled at his torso joint. \"While we still wore human\n> bodies at the beginning of our rule, all twenty Titans underwent the\n> biotech life extension, just like you, so I am quite familiar with the\n> level of pain you endured. We *needed* to live for centuries, because\n> we required that much time to reassert vision and competent leadership\n> upon the waning Old Empire. Even after we converted ourselves into\n> cymeks, the process helped prevent our ancient biological brains from\n> degenerating because of our extreme age.\"\n>\n> His mechanical body strode closer. \"This life-extension process is our\n> little secret, Vorian. The League of Nobles would tear themselves into\n> a frenzy if they knew we had such technology.\" Agamemnon made a\n> wistful sound,\n>\n> almost a sigh. \"But beware, my son: Even such enhancements cannot\n> protect you against accidents or outright assassination attempts. As,\n> unfortunately, Barbarossa recently discovered.\"\n>\n> Vor finally struggled shakily to his feet. He located a water\n> dispenser, gulped a beaker of cool liquid, and felt his heartbeat\n> slowing.\n>\n> \"Astonishing events await you, my son. Your life is no longer a candle\n> in the wind. You have time to experience many things, important\n> things.\"\n>\n> The hulking cymek stalked over to a harness and used an intricate\n> network of artificial hands and clamps extruded from the metal wall to\n> link to the thoughtrodes of his brain canister. Flexible lifting arms\n> raised the cylinder out of the colossus body core and shuttled it over\n> to one of the chrome pedestals.\n>\n> \"Now you are one step closer to your potential, Vorian,\" Agamemnon\n> said through a wall speaker, detached from the mobile body.\n>\n> Though weak and still in pain, Vor knew what his father expected of\n> him now. He hurried to the conditioning devices and with trembling\n> hands attached power cables to the magsockets of the translucent brain\n> chamber. The bluish electrafluid seemed full of mental energy.\n>\n> Trying to restore a sense of normalcy amid the clamoring disbelief at\n> what had just happened to him, Vor went through his habitual grooming\n> duties, tending his father's mechanical systems. Lovingly, the young\n> man gazed at the wrinkled mass of brain, the ancient mind so full of\n> profound ideas and difficult decisions, as expressed in the general's\n> extensive memoirs. Each time he read them, Vor hoped to understand his\n> complex father better.\n>\n> He wondered if Agamemnon had kept him in the dark to play a cruel joke\n> on him, or to challenge his resolve. Vor would always accept whatever\n> the cymek general commanded, would never try to flee. Now that the\n> agony was over, he hoped he had passed whatever test his father had\n> administered.\n>\n> As Vor continued the patient grooming of the preservation tank,\n> Agamemnon spoke softly, a susurration. \"You are very quiet, my son.\n> What do you think about the great gift you have received?\"\n>\n> The young man paused a moment, not certain how to respond. Agamemnon\n> was often impulsive and difficult to understand, but he rarely acted\n> without a larger purpose in mind. Vor could only hope to comprehend\n> the overall picture someday, the grand tapestry.\n>\n> \"Thank you, Father,\" he finally said, \"for giving me more time to\n> accomplish everything you want me to do.\"\n>\n> *Why do humans spend so much time worrying about what they call \"moral\n> issues\"? It is one of the many mysteries of their behavior.*\n\n--- ERASMUS,\n\n*Reflections on Sentient Biologicals*\n\n> **T**he identical twin girls looked peaceful and asleep, side by side,\n> like little angels in a cozy bed.

Was\n> it a miraculous fluke? The more Erasmus learned, the more questions he\n> developed. The inarguable successes of their chaotic civilization\n> presented a deep quandary in his mind. He had dissected the brains of\n> more than a thousand specimens, young and old, male and female,\n> intelligent and dimwitted. He had made detailed analyses and\n> comparisons, processing data through the unlimited capacity of the\n> Omnius evermind.\n>\n> Even so, none of the answers were clear.\n>\n> The brains of no two human beings were exactly identical, not even\n> when the subjects were raised under matching conditions, or if they\n> started out as twins. *A confusing mass of unnecessary variables!* No\n> aspect of their physiology remained consistent from person to person.\n>\n> *Maddening exceptions, everywhere!*\n>\n> Nonetheless, Erasmus did notice patterns. Humans were full of\n> differences and surprises, but as a species they behaved according to\n> general rules. Under certain conditions, especially when crowded into\n> confined spaces, people reacted with a pack mentality, blindly\n> following others, eschewing individuality.\n>\n> Sometimes humans were valiant; sometimes they were cowards. It\n> especially intrigued Erasmus to see what happened when he conducted\n> \"panic experiments\" on crowds of them in the breeding pens, wading in\n> and butchering some while letting others survive. In such\n> circumstances of extreme stress, leaders invariably emerged, people\n> who behaved with more inner strength than the others. Erasmus\n> especially liked to kill those individuals and then watch the\n> devastating effect it had on the rest of the people.\n>\n> Perhaps his sample group of experimental subjects over the centuries\n> was too small. He might need to vivisect and dissect tens of thousands\n> more before he could draw meaningful conclusions. A monumental task,\n> but as a machine Erasmus had no limitations on energy, or patience.\n>\n> With one of his personal probes, he touched the cheek of the larger of\n> the two girls and sensed her steady pulse. Every droplet of blood\n> seemed to withhold secrets from him, as if the entire race was\n> participating in a massive conspiracy against him.

Could they sense one another's pain?\n>\n> He chided himself for his lack of foresight and planning. *I should\n> have put the mother on the same table.*\n>\n> His thoughts were interrupted by Omnius, who spoke from the nearest\n> wallscreen. \"Your new female slave has arrived, a last gift from the\n> Titan Barbarossa. She awaits you in the sitting room.\"\n>\n> Erasmus raised his bloody metal hands. He had looked forward to\n> receiving the woman captured from Giedi Prime, supposedly the daughter\n> of the League Viceroy. Her familial ties suggested genetic\n> superiority, and he had many questions to ask her about the government\n> of the feral humans.\n>\n> \"Will you vivisect her as well?\"\n>\n> \"I prefer to keep my options open.\"\n>\n> Erasmus looked down at the twin girls, one already dead from the\n> interrupted exposure of her brain tissue. A wasted opportunity.\n>\n> \"Analyzing docile slaves gives you irrelevant results, Erasmus. All\n> thoughts of revolt have been bred out of them. Therefore, any\n> information you derive is of questionable applicability for military\n> purposes.\" The evermind's voice boomed from the wallscreen.\n>\n> Erasmus soaked his organic-plastic hands in solvent to eliminate the\n> drying blood. He had access to thousands of years of human-compiled\n> psychological studies, but even with so much data it was not possible\n> to create a clear answer. Many self-proclaimed \"experts\" offered\n> wildly disparate answers.\n>\n> On the table, the surviving twin continued to mewl her pain and fear.\n> \"I disagree, Omnius. The human creature is innately rebellious. The\n> trait is inherent in their species. Slaves will never be entirely\n> loyal to us, no matter\n>\n> how many generations they have served. Trustees, workers, it makes no\n> difference.\"\n>\n> \"You overestimate the strength of their will.\" The evermind sounded\n> smugly confident.\n>\n> \"And I challenge your flawed assumptions.\" His curiosity piqued, sure\n> of his private understanding, Erasmus stood before the swirling\n> screen. \"Given time and adequate provocation, I could turn any\n> completely loyal worker against us, even the most privileged trustee.\"\n>\n> With a long litany of data from his storehouse of information, Omnius\n> disputed this. The evermind was confident that his slaves would remain\n> dependable, though perhaps he had been overly complacent, overly\n> lenient. He wanted the universe to run smoothly and efficiently, and\n> did not like the surprises and unpredictability of League humans.\n>\n> Omnius and Erasmus debated with growing intensity until the\n> independent robot finally put a stop to it. \"Both of us are making\n> conjectures based upon preconceived notions. Therefore, I propose an\n> experiment to determine the correct answer.

It is a fundamental flaw in their biological\n> programming. Would that not be useful information?\"\n>\n> \"Yes. And if your assertion is correct, Erasmus, then I can never\n> again trust my own slaves.

For the\n>\n> inquisitive robot, this was much more than a mere wager with his\n> superior; it was an investigation into the deepest motivations and\n> decision-making processes of human beings.\n>\n> But the consequences of discovering the answers could be terrible. He\n> needed to win the argument, but in such a manner that Omnius did not\n> shut down his experiments.\n>\n> \"Let me ponder the mechanics of implementation,\" Erasmus suggested,\n> then gladly emerged from the laboratory to go meet his new female\n> house slave, Serena Butler.\n>\n> *The universe is a playground of improvisation--- it follows no\n> external pattern.*\n>\n> --- COGITOR RETICULUS, *Observations from a Height of a Thousand\n> Years*\n>\n> **N**umbers and concepts danced in her dreams, but every time Norma\n> Cenva tried to manipulate them, they slipped away like snowflakes\n> melting on her fingers.

But he was\n> a scientist, after all, and she felt they had been brought together\n> for an important purpose. It was her duty to point out when she felt\n> he was making an error. He would have done the same for her. \"I still\n> think you shouldn't devote any further time or resources to the\n> resonance-generator project.\"\n>\n> \"Since the resources are mine to distribute as I see fit,\" Holtzman\n> said in a huff, \"I will continue, and hope to prove you wrong.\" He\n> left her chamber, grumbling.\n>\n> She called after him in an attempt to ease the situation. \"Believe me,\n> Savant, I hope you prove me wrong.\"\n>\n> *There is a certain malevolence about the formation of social orders,\n> a profound struggle, with despotism on one end and slavery on the\n> other.*\n\n--- TLALOC,\n\n*Weaknesses of the Empire*\n\n> **P**oritrin's river delta was not at all like Harmonthep's gentle\n> rivulets and marshes.

Because\n> of those prophesies, the Zensunnis had left the company of other men.\n> In the\n>\n> decaying Old Empire, people had forgotten God and then suffered when\n> the thinking machines took over. Ishmael's people believed it was\n> their fate, the great Kralizec, or typhoon struggle at the end of the\n> universe, that had been foretold for millennia. Those who followed the\n> Buddislamic creed had escaped, already knowing the outcome of that\n> hopeless battle.\n>\n> Yet that struggle had not ended according to the prophesy. Part of the\n> human race had survived the machine demons, and now those people had\n> turned against the \"cowardly\" Buddislamic refugees with revenge in\n> their hearts.\n>\n> Ishmael did not believe that the old teachings could have been wrong.\n> So many sutras, so many prophesies. His grandfather had seemed certain\n> when he spoke of the legends . . . yet still their peaceful Harmonthep\n> village had been overrun, the strongest and healthiest taken as\n> slaves. And now Ishmael and his fellows were on a far-off world, their\n> bodies for sale.\n>\n> Weyop had said that non-Buddislamic outsiders were condemned to\n> eternal damnation . . . yet the Tlulaxa flesh merchants and the new\n> masters on Poritrin controlled their food and their lives. The boy and\n> his companions had no choice but to do as they were told.\n>\n> Since Ishmael was the youngest captive, the owners expected little of\n> him. They ordered his work group to watch over the boy, to make\n> certain he completed his tasks . . . or if he failed, to pick up the\n> slack.\n>\n> Despite his aching muscles and blistering skin, Ishmael worked as hard\n> as the others. He watched his despairing fellows waste time with\n> complaints, an attitude that angered the owners and led to unnecessary\n> punishments. Ishmael kept his misery to himself.\n>\n> He spent weeks up to his knees in the slimy mudflats where ropes and\n> stakes marked out fertile shellfish beds. He ran back and forth to\n> basins that contained clam seedlings, scooped up handfuls of the tiny\n> bivalent and rushed them out into the wet fields. If he cupped his\n> hands too tightly, he crushed the delicate shells--- such carelessness\n> had already earned him a thrashing with a sonic whip when an\n> agricultural supervisor saw what he\n>\n> had done. Like icy fire, the whip had made his skin bubble and spasm.\n> The discipline left no mark, caused no physical damage, yet that\n> single whip stroke burned a permanent scar in his brain, and Ishmael\n> knew to avoid that forever.\n>\n> Punishment would accomplish nothing and could only make him more\n> miserable, while giving the owners yet another victory over him. He\n> *chose* not to grant them that. Despite the fact that it was an\n> insignificant matter, he would attempt to control it as much as\n> possible.\n>\n> Right now, seeing the workers in the mudflats, Ishmael was almost glad\n> his parents had died in a storm, struck by lightning in a skiff on the\n> large lake where seeping oil made the fish taste bad. At least they\n> couldn't see him now, and neither could his grandfather. . . .\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AFTER THE FIRST month on Poritrin, Ishmael's hands and legs became so\n> impregnated with black mud that even repeated lashings could not\n> remove the stain. His fingernails were broken and caked with river\n> muck.\n>\n> On Harmonthep, Ishmael had spent his days wading through the marshes,\n> collecting eggs from qaraa nests, netting turtlebugs, and digging\n> osthmir tubers that grew in the brackish water. From a young age, he\n> had been toughened to a life of toil, but here he resented the work,\n> because it was not for the glory of Buddallah, not for the health and\n> well-being of his people. It was for someone else.\n>\n> In the Poritrin slave compound, women cooked their food, using the\n> unusual ingredients and spices they were given. Ishmael longed for the\n> taste of fish baked in lily leaves and of sweet reeds whose juices\n> could make a boy drunk with delight.\n>\n> At night, half of the communal dwellings were vacant because so many\n> slaves had died from the fever. Ishmael often crawled to his pallet\n> and fell deeply asleep. Other times, he forced himself to remain awake\n> and sit in the storytelling circles.\n>\n> The men talked among themselves, debating whether to select a new\n> leader for their group. To some of them, the concept seemed pointless.\n> There could be no escape, and a leader could only inspire them to take\n> chances that would get them all killed. Ishmael felt sad, remembering\n> how his grandfather had expected to name a successor one day. Yet the\n> Tlulaxa flesh merchants had changed all of that. Unable to reach a\n> decision, the Zensunni men talked on and on. It made Ishmael want to\n> drift off to the oblivion of sleep.\n>\n> He liked it better when the men told old stories, reciting the poetic\n> \"Songs of the Long Trek\" about the Zensunni Wanderings, how his people\n> had sought a home where they would be safe from both the thinking\n> machines and the League Worlds. Ishmael had never seen a robot and\n> wondered if they were only imaginary monsters to frighten disobedient\n> children. But he had indeed seen evil men--- the raiders who had\n> decimated his quiet village, mistreated his grandfather, taken so many\n> innocents captive.\n>\n> Sitting at the edge of the firelight, Ishmael listened to the tales of\n> his people. The Zensunni were accustomed to tribulations, and they\n> might have to tolerate even generations of slavery on this planet so\n> far from home. No matter the challenge, his people knew how to endure.\n>\n> Of all the stories the boy had heard, the covenants and prophecies, he\n> clung to one above all the others: the promise that the misery would\n> one day end.\n>\n> *There is no clear division between Gods and Men--- one blends softly\n> casual into the other.*\n>\n> --- IBLIS GINJO,\n\n*Options for Total Liberation*\n\n> **T**he ornate pedestal for the statue of the Titan Ajax was nearly\n> complete. Crew master Iblis Ginjo perused the daily tally and\n> production requirements on his electronic notepad. He had made his\n> slaves understand their very real danger, should the brutal cymek lose\n> patience. They worked very hard, not just for fear of their lives, but\n> because Iblis had inspired them.\n>\n> Then, a disaster occurred on another part of the project.\n>\n> With the heat of day rising around the observation scaffold where\n> Iblis stood supervising the stabilization of the sturdy pedestal, in\n> the distance he saw the top of the nearly completed Ajax statue begin\n> to move. The iron, polymer, and stone colossus tottered one way and\n> then the other, as if gravity itself were shaking the enormous work of\n> art.\n>\n> Suddenly the giant monument toppled with a crashing roar, accompanied\n> by distant shouts and screams. As a cloud of dust climbed into the\n> sky, Iblis knew that any slave who had been crushed under the massive\n> statue should be considered lucky.\n>\n> Once Ajax learned of the catastrophe, the real mayhem would begin.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> EVEN BEFORE THE dust and rubble settled, Iblis rushed into the furious\n> debate among neo-cymeks and his fellow trustee crew leaders. It hadn't\n> been his part of the monument project that had collapsed, but his\n> teams would suffer in the inevitable delays caused by the accident.\n> Still, Iblis hoped his charismatic mediation skills could help\n> mitigate the disaster.\n>\n> Enraged neo-cymeks saw the clumsy damage as a personal affront to\n> their revered Titan predecessors. Ajax himself had already torn a work\n> supervisor limb from limb, and gory body parts lay scattered and\n> dripping in the dust.\n>\n> With all the compelling passion he could summon, Iblis Ginjo made the\n> angry neo-cymeks pause. \"Wait, wait! This can be fixed, if you will\n> allow me!\"\n>\n> Ajax rose taller, more threatening than any of the neo-cymeks, but\n> Iblis continued, his words silky. \"True, the enormous statue has\n> suffered some harm, but nothing more than superficial blemishes. Lord\n> Ajax, this monument was designed to endure throughout the ages!\n> Certainly it can endure a few bumps and scratches. Your grand legacy\n> is not so easily bruised.\"\n>\n> He paused as the cymeks were forced to admit the truth of this. Then\n> he pointed toward his own work area and continued in a reasonable\n> tone, \"Look, my crews have nearly finished the sturdy pedestal\n> designed to hold up the statue. Why don't we erect it anyway, to show\n> the universe that we can brush aside minor annoyances like this\n> accident? My workers can perform all the necessary repairs in place.\"\n> Iblis's eyes shone with artificial enthusiasm. \"There is no reason for\n> further delay.\"\n>\n> Pacing about the carnage and confusion in his menacing armored body,\n> Ajax stomped on one of the crew leaders who was babbling his\n> innocence, pulping him into the ground. Then the angry Titan towered\n> over Iblis, optic threads glowing like white-hot stars. \"You have now\n> accepted responsibility to see that work continues according to\n> schedule. If your teams fail, the blame will be yours.\"\n>\n> \"Of course, Lord Ajax.\" Iblis showed no alarm at all. He could\n> convince the slaves to carry the burden. They would do it for him.\n>\n> \"Then get this mess cleaned up!\" Ajax thundered in a voice that could\n> be heard across the hilltop Forum.\n>\n> Later, Iblis made promises to his already-exhausted, overtaxed slaves.\n> They had been discontented and resistant for a while, but he won them\n> over with a stirring account of the wondrous benefits they would\n> receive: the finest sex slaves, incredible feasts, days of leisure to\n> journey about the countryside. \"I am not like other trustees. Have I\n> ever let you down? Ever promised a reward that I failed to deliver?\"\n>\n> With such an incentive, not to mention a healthy dose of fear for the\n> Titan Ajax, the laborers set to the task with redoubled energy. In the\n> coolness of the evening, with hovering spotlights glaring like\n> super-novas over the construction site, Iblis kept his crew working\n> efficiently. From his high wooden platform, he watched as the slaves\n> raised the immense statue on its sturdy reinforced pedestal and\n> plasma-bolted it into place.\n>\n> Artisans rushed forward and scaled the curved stone-and-iron surface\n> with climbing equipment, and set up swaying temporary scaffolds to\n> begin their restoration work. Ajax's legendary face had a marred nose\n> and one dented muscular arm, as well as deep gouges across the front\n> of the Titan uniform. In his secret heart, Iblis suspected the real\n> Ajax's human form had been lumpish and ugly.\n>\n> Throughout the long, tiresome night, Iblis struggled to stay awake,\n> leaning against the rail and peering into the blurring abyss. He dozed\n> off, then awoke, startled, as he heard the smooth hum of the lift\n> platform rising to his level.\n>\n> But he was mystified to see that the lift bore no one at all. Only a\n> small sheet of rolled-up metal, a message cylinder. Iblis stared, his\n> heart pounding, but the lift remained at his level, as if waiting. He\n> looked over the edge, but could not determine who had left the\n> message.\n>\n> *How could he ignore it?*\n>\n> Iblis stole forward and grabbed the scrap of scribed metal. He broke\n> the seal, unrolled the thin sheet, and read with increasing\n> astonishment.\n>\n> \"We represent an organized movement of dissatisfied humans. We are\n> waiting for the right moment and the right leader to begin an open\n> revolt against the oppressive machines. You must determine if you wish\n> to join our worthy cause. We will contact you again.\"\n>\n> As Iblis stared in disbelief at the unsigned message, the lettering\n> faded and disappeared, corroding into blobs of rust that ate through\n> the metal itself and flaked away.\n>\n> Was it authentic, or some sort of a cymek trap designed to lure him?\n> Most humans hated their machine masters, but took pains to conceal it.\n> *What if there really is such a group?* And if so, they would need\n> talented leaders.\n>\n> The thought exhilarated him. Iblis had never considered such an idea\n> before, and he couldn't imagine what he had said or done to reveal his\n> innermost thoughts and feelings. Why did they suspect? He had always\n> been respectful to his superiors, had always---\n>\n> *But have I been overly attentive? Have I tried too hard to appear\n> loyal?*\n>\n> On the towering Ajax statue, just below his own level, the artisans\n> remained hard at work like busy termites on a log. They repaired\n> scrape marks, expertly patched and painted the marred exterior. Dawn\n> broke across the monumental statue, and Iblis could see they would be\n> finished soon. The machines would reward him for his labors.\n>\n> How he hated them!\n>\n> Iblis wrestled with his conscience. The thinking machines had treated\n> him well in comparison with other slaves, but only a thin layer of\n> protection kept him from the same fate. In his private moments Iblis\n> often pondered the value of freedom, and what he could do if given the\n> chance.\n>\n> A rebel group? He could barely believe it. As days went by, Iblis\n> found himself thinking about it more and more . . . and waiting to be\n> contacted again.\n\n> *Our appetite encompasses everything.*\n\n--- COGITOR EKLO,\n\n*Beyond the Human Mind*\n\n> **W**ith all the hatred concealed inside his mind, Agamemnon took\n> special precautions wherever Omnius could spy on him. This meant\n> almost always, and almost everywhere--- even when Agamemnon and Juno\n> had passionate sex. Or at least what passed for sex among the Titans.\n>\n> For their tryst, walker bodies brought the two ancient cymeks into a\n> maintenance chamber within the control pavilion on Earth. Around them,\n> tubes of nutrient liquids snaked toward storage tanks in the ceiling.\n> Robotic tenders moved from life-support generators to analysis banks,\n> skimming data from thoughtrodes, ensuring that all systems remained\n> within normal parameters.\n>\n> Agamemnon and Juno conversed with each other on a private short-range\n> band, twitching their respective sensors and sparking each other's\n> thoughtrodes through the electrafluid. *Foreplay*. Even without\n> physical bodies, the cymek minds could still experience intense\n> pleasure.\n>\n> Automated lifters disengaged his preservation canister smoothly from\n> its walking body, then set the thinking core on a clean chrome\n> pedestal beside the container that held Juno's pinkish gray brain.\n> With the accessible optic threads and computer comparison grids, he\n> recognized the distinctive folds and lobes of his lover's mind. *Still\n> beautiful after all these centuries*.\n>\n> Agamemnon remembered how lovely she had been back in the beginning:\n> obsidian-black hair that shimmered with blue highlights. Her nose had\n> been pointed, her face narrow, with eyebrows that arched in a\n> mysterious way. He always thought of her as Cleopatra, another\n> military genius from the mists of history, just like the first\n> Agamemnon in the Trojan War.\n>\n> Long ago, during the eyeblink of time when he had worn a frail human\n> physique, Agamemnon had fallen in love with this woman. Though Juno\n> was extremely desirable sexually, he had been attracted to her mind\n> before ever meeting her in person. He had first become aware of her on\n> a complex virtual network through tactical simulations and wargames he\n> had fought with her on the Old Empire's docile computers. The two of\n> them had been teenagers then, back when age mattered.\n>\n> As a boy, Agamemnon had been raised on pampered Earth, with the name\n> of Andrew Skouros. His parents had led a hedonistic but passionless\n> lifestyle, as had so many other citizens. They existed, they dabbled .\n> . . but none of them really *lived*. Across the depths of time, he\n> barely remembered the faces of his parents. All weak and feeble humans\n> looked the same to him now.\n>\n> Andrew Skouros had always been restless. He had asked uncomfortable\n> questions that no one could answer. While the others played frivolous\n> parlor games, the young man dug into archival databases, where he\n> uncovered history and legends. He found heroic tales of real people\n> who had existed so long ago they seemed as mythical as the race of\n> Titans, the earliest gods overthrown by Zeus and a pantheon of Greek\n> deities. He analyzed military conquests and came to understand tactics\n> at a time when it was an obsolete skill in the peace-strangled Empire.\n>\n> Under the alias \"Agamemnon,\" he became interested in strategic games\n> played across the computer network that monitored the activities of\n> ennui-enslaved humanity. There he had encountered another person as\n> skilled and talented as himself, a rare soulmate who shared his\n> restless interests. The mysterious player's wild and unexpected ideas\n> caused her campaigns to fail as often as they succeeded--- but her\n> surprising successes more than made up for the spectacular failures.\n> Her intriguing alias was \"Juno,\" taken from the queen of the Roman\n> gods, wife of Jupiter.\n>\n> Drawn together by their common ambition, their relationship was fiery\n> and challenging, more than just sex. They pleasured themselves by\n> developing\n>\n> thought-experiments. It was a game at first . . . and then much more\n> than that.\n>\n> Their lives changed dramatically when they had heard Tlaloc speak.\n>\n> The offworld visionary, with his disturbing, chastising accusations\n> against complacent humanity on Earth, made the two young schemers\n> realize that their plans could blossom into more than just imaginative\n> adventures.\n>\n> Juno, whose real name was Julianna Parhi, had brought the three of\n> them together. She and Andrew Skouros arranged to speak with Tlaloc,\n> who was excited to learn that they shared his dreams. \"We may be few,\"\n> Tlaloc had said, \"but in Earth's forests full of deadwood, three\n> matches may be enough to spark a conflagration.\"\n>\n> Meeting secretly, the rebellious trio plotted to overthrow the\n> sleeping Empire. Using Andrew's military expertise, they saw that a\n> small investment of hardware and manpower could take over many worlds\n> that had fallen into apathetic stupor. With a little luck and\n> acceptable tactics, like-minded leaders could form an iron grip around\n> the Old Empire. In fact, if the plans were properly set in motion, the\n> conquerors could achieve victory before anyone even noticed.\n>\n> \"It is for humanity's own good,\" Tlaloc had said, his eyes sparkling.\n> \"And for ours,\" Juno added. \"Just a little.\"\n>\n> In one of her innovative plans, Juno utilized the pervasive network of\n> thinking machines and their servile robots. The docile computers had\n> been given artificial intelligence to watch over every aspect of human\n> society, but Julianna saw them as an invasion army already in place .\n> . . if only they could be reprogrammed, given a taste for conquest and\n> human ambition. It was then that they had brought in a computer\n> specialist named Vilhelm Jayther--- who called himself Barbarossa on\n> computer networks--- to implement the technical details.\n>\n> Thus began the Time of Titans, during which a handful of enthusiastic\n> humans controlled the sleeping populace. They had work to do, an\n> empire to rule.\n>\n> During their planning stages, Julianna Parhi often queried a reluctant\n> Cogitor advisor, Eklo. While consulting the ancient Cogitor, one of\n> many spiritual minds who contemplated esoteric questions, she had seen\n> the possibilities of living as a disembodied brain. Not just for\n> introspection, but for action. She realized the advantages a *cymek*\n> tyrant would have over simple humans, able to switch mechanical bodies\n> as circumstances changed. As cymeks, the Titans could live and rule\n> for thousands of years.\n>\n> Perhaps that would be long enough.\n>\n> Agamemnon had immediately agreed with Juno's concept, though he faced\n> a primitive fear of the surgery itself. He and Juno knew that as the\n> Titans experienced the dangers of the universe and the fragility of\n> their human bodies, they would all come around.\n>\n> To show faith in his lover, Agamemnon was the first to undergo the\n> cymek process. He and Juno had spent a last heated night together,\n> naked and touching, storing memories of nerve sensations that would\n> have to last for millennia. Juno had tossed her raven hair, given him\n> a final, tender kiss, and led him into the surgical chamber. There,\n> computerized medical apparatus, robotic surgeons, and dozens of\n> life-support systems waited for him.\n>\n> The Cogitor Eklo had observed and assisted, offering advice whenever\n> necessary, providing precise instructions for the robotic surgeons.\n> Juno had watched her lover, eyes misty as she witnessed the\n> transformation process. Agamemnon feared that she would become\n> squeamish after that and renege on her own plans. But once his brain\n> hung suspended in dynamic electrafluid, once the thoughtrodes were\n> activated and he could \"see\" again through a galaxy of optic threads,\n> Juno was there admiring him, studying the brain canister.\n>\n> She had touched his transparent case with her fingertips. Agamemnon\n> watched it all, focusing and adjusting his new and unfamiliar sensors,\n>\n> enthralled with the ability to observe everything at once.\n>\n> A week later, when he felt competent enough with his new mechanical\n> systems, Agamemnon had returned the favor, watching over Juno as the\n> robotic surgeons sawed open her skull and removed her talented brain,\n> discarding forever the fallible female body of Julianna Parhi. . . .\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> CENTURIES LATER, EVEN without biological bodies, he and Juno remained\n> side by side on their chrome pedestals, connected by receptors and\n> stimulus patches.\n>\n> Agamemnon knew precisely which parts of Juno's brain to pulse in order\n> to activate pleasure centers, and how long to maintain the\n> stimulation. She responded in kind, bringing forth his stored memories\n> of human lovemaking and then amplifying the remembered sensations,\n> stunning him with new heights of euphoria. He struck back with a bolt\n> of his own, causing her brain to quiver.\n>\n> Through it all, the information-gathering watcheyes of Omnius observed\n> intently, like a mechanized voyeur. Even in a time such as this,\n> Agamemnon and Juno were never alone.\n>\n> She pleasured him twice more, making his mind throb; he wanted her to\n> stop so that he could rest, but also longed for her to continue.\n> Agamemnon reciprocated, causing a thin, vibrating sound to pulse from\n> the speakers attached to the canisters, an eerie warbling music that\n> symbolized their merging orgasms. He could barely think through the\n> haze of delight.\n>\n> But his brooding anger continued in the background. Though Omnius\n> allowed him and Juno to have their ecstasy as often as they wished,\n> Agamemnon would have derived even greater pleasure if they could\n> permanently escape the domination of the damned thinking machines.\n>\n> *I fear that Norma will never amount to anything. How does that\n> reflect on me and my own legacy to humanity?*\n>\n> --- ZUFA CENVA\n>\n> **D**uring the tedious month-long journey across space to visit her\n> daughter on Poritrin, Zufa Cenva had plenty of time to ponder what she\n> would say when she arrived. She would rather have been spending so\n> many days and weeks elsewhere on her more important work. The loss of\n> dear Heoma weighed like a hot stone inside her chest. Ever since the\n> first devastating attack against the cymeks on Giedi Prime, Zufa had\n> been planning further strikes with her other Sorceress weapons.\n>\n> While most members of the League gave credit to Savant Holtzman for\n> the portable scrambler projectors, she had heard whispers that Norma\n> herself may have inspired the design. Could her oddball daughter have\n> done something so remarkable? Not as great as a psychic storm\n> obliterating cymeks, but still respectable. *Perhaps I have been blind\n> after all.* Zufa had never wanted Norma to fail, but had given up hope\n> by now. Maybe things could change in their relationship. *Should I\n> embrace her? Does she deserve my support and encouragement, or will\n> she make me ashamed of her?*\n>\n> These were uncertain times.\n>\n> As Zufa stepped off the transport in Starda, she encountered a\n> delegation waiting to greet her, complete with ornately garbed Dragoon\n> guards, their gold-scale armor immaculate. Ruddy-faced Lord Niko Bludd\n> himself led the group, his beard intricately curled, his clothes\n> perfumed and colorful.\n>\n> \"Poritrin is honored by the visit of a Sorceress!\" The noble stepped\n> forward on the mosaic tile floor. Bludd wore a dashing ceremonial\n> costume with broad carmine lapels, frilly white cuffs, and golden\n> shoes. A ceremonial sword hung at his waist, though he had probably\n> never used a blade for anything more dangerous than cutting cheese.\n>\n> She'd never had any use for frippery when there was work to be done,\n> and Bludd's arrival surprised her. She had hoped to conclude her\n> business with Norma unobtrusively and then quickly return to Rossak.\n> She and her dedicated psychic warriors must prepare another mental\n> strike against the cymeks.\n>\n> \"The shuttle captain transmitted a message that you were coming,\n> Madame Cenva,\" Bludd said, as he guided her through the terminal. \"We\n> barely had time to put together a reception for you. You are here to\n> see your daughter, I presume?\" Niko Bludd grinned above his curled\n> reddish beard. \"We are very proud of how much she is helping Savant\n> Holtzman. He considers her quite indispensible.\"\n>\n> \"Indeed?\" Zufa tried to control her skeptical frown.\n>\n> \"We invited Norma to join us today, but she is deeply engrossed in\n> important work for Savant Holtzman. She seemed to think that you would\n> understand why she could not meet you herself.\"\n>\n> Zufa felt as if she had been slapped. \"I have been en route for a\n> month. If *I* can make the time, then a mere . . . lab assistant can\n> arrange to pick me up.\"\n>\n> Outside the spaceport, a chauffeur guided her to a lavish airbarge,\n> and the Dragoon guards took their places at the rails. \"We will\n> transport you directly to Holtzman's laboratories.\" When Bludd seated\n> himself beside her, she wrinkled her nose at his strong body perfumes.\n> He extended a small package to her, which she didn't want.\n>\n> With a sigh of exasperation, Zufa sat rigidly in the comfortable seat\n> as the aircraft proceeded away from the spaceport. Removing the\n> package's silver wrapping paper, Zufa found a bottle of river water\n> and an exquisitely woven Poritrin towel.\n>\n> Despite her lack of interest, the flamboyant noble insisted on\n> explaining. \"It is traditional for honored guests to wash their hands\n> in the water of the Isana and dry themselves on our fine linen.\"\n>\n> She made no move to use the gifts. Beneath the flying barge, water\n> vessels traveled downriver toward the sprawling delta city, where\n> grains, metals, and manufactured supplies were distributed to Poritrin\n> suppliers. In the brown mudflats, hundreds of slaves worked in the\n> muck to plant paddies of shellfish. The sight made her feel even more\n> unsettled than she already was.\n>\n> \"The residence of Savant Holtzman is just ahead,\" Bludd said, pointing\n> to a high bluff. \"I am sure your daughter will be pleased to see you.\"\n>\n> *Has she ever been pleased to see me?* Zufa wondered. She tried to\n> calm herself with mental exercises, but anxiety intruded.\n>\n> With a sweep of her long black dress, she stepped away from the\n> ostentatious airbarge as soon as it set down on Holtzman's landing\n> deck. \"Lord Bludd, I have private business to discuss with my\n> daughter. I'm sure you understand.\" Without further farewell, Zufa\n> marched alone up the broad patio steps to the mansion, leaving a\n> befuddled Bludd behind her. She waved her long arms, shooing him away.\n>\n> Her telepathic senses attuned, Zufa entered the dwelling as if she\n> belonged there. Holtzman's vestibule was cluttered with disarrayed\n> boxes, books, and instruments. Either the household staff did not do\n> their work, or the inventor had forbidden them to \"organize\" too much.\n>\n> Picking a path through the obstacles, Zufa strode into a long hallway,\n> then searched rooms and demanded information from anyone she met until\n> she found her daughter. Finally, the tall and intimidating Sorceress\n> entered an auxiliary laboratory building, where she saw a high stool\n> at an angled lightstrip table that held blueprint films. No sign of\n> Norma.\n>\n> She noticed an open door that led out to a balcony, then saw a shadow,\n> heard something move. Gliding to the balcony, Zufa was shocked to see\n> her daughter perched on top of the railing. Norma gripped a red plaz\n> container in her small hands.\n>\n> \"What are you doing?\" Zufa asked. \"Get down from there immediately!\"\n>\n> Startled, Norma glanced at her looming mother, then clasped the object\n> tightly and leaped off the railing out into the open air.\n>\n> \"No!\" Zufa shouted. But it was too late.\n>\n> Rushing to the edge, the Sorceress saw to her horror that the balcony\n> jutted out over a high bluff that dropped to the river, far below. The\n> small-statured young woman tumbled through the air, falling.\n>\n> Suddenly, Norma paused in midair and spun in a peculiar fashion. She\n> called, \"See for yourself, it works! You arrived just in time!\" Then,\n> like a feather on the wind, the girl drifted upward. The red device\n> lifted her back toward the balcony, like an invisible hand.\n>\n> Norma reached the level of the railing, and her angry mother yanked\n> her back onto the balcony. \"Why would you try something so dangerous?\n> Doesn't Savant Holtzman prefer you to employ helpers for this sort of\n> test?\"\n>\n> Norma frowned. \"They have *slaves* here, not helpers. Besides, it is\n> my own invention, and I wanted to do it myself. I knew it would work.\"\n>\n> Zufa did not want to argue. \"You came all the way to Poritrin and used\n> the League's best engineering laboratories to design some sort of . .\n> . flying toy?\"\n>\n> \"Hardly, Mother.\" Norma opened the lid of the red plaz unit and\n> adjusted electronics inside. \"It is a variation on Savant Holtzman's\n> theories, a repelling, or suspensor field. I expect him to be\n> delighted by it.\"\n>\n> \"Oh, I am, I am!\" The scientist appeared suddenly and stood behind\n> Zufa. He quickly introduced himself, then looked at Norma's new\n> gadget. \"I'll show it to Lord Bludd and see what he thinks of the\n> commercial possibilities. I'm sure he'll want a patent in his own\n> name.\"\n>\n> Zufa looked on, still recovering from the shock of Norma's \"fall,\"\n> trying to see practical applications of her daughter's invention.\n> Could such a thing be\n>\n> modified to carry troops or heavy objects? She doubted it.\n>\n> Norma set down the red-plaz generator and crossed the room with her\n> awkward, waddling gait. She climbed her high stool to reach the\n> blueprint films on the slanted light table, where she sifted through\n> pages. \"I've figured out how this principle can also be used on\n> illumination devices. The suspensor field can float lights and power\n> them with residual energy. I have all the calculations . . .\n> somewhere.\"\n>\n> \"Floating lights?\" Zufa said, in scornful tone. \"For what, a picnic?\n> Tens of thousands died in the cymek attack on Zimia, millions were\n> enslaved on Giedi Prime, and you live in secluded comfort--- making\n> floating *lights*?\"\n>\n> Norma gave her mother a condescending look, as if *Zufa* was the\n> foolish one. \"Think beyond the obvious, Mother. A war needs more than\n> just weapons. Robots can alter their optic sensors to see in the dark,\n> but humans must have light to see. Hundreds of these suspensor lights\n> could be dispersed in a nighttime combat zone, negating any advantage\n> the machines might have. Savant Holtzman and I think along those lines\n> every day.\"\n>\n> The scientist nodded, quick to concur with her. \"Or, for commercial\n> uses, they could be designed in a number of styles, even tuned to any\n> color or shade.\"\n>\n> Norma sat on her stool like a gnome perched on a throne. Her brown\n> eyes sparkled with excitement. \"I'm sure Lord Bludd will be most\n> pleased.\"\n>\n> Zufa frowned. There were more important issues at stake in this war\n> than pleasing a foppish nobleman. Impatient, she said, \"I came a great\n> distance to see you.\"\n>\n> Norma raised her eyebrows skeptically. \"If you had bothered to see me\n> *before* I departed from Rossak, Mother, you wouldn't have needed to\n> make such a long voyage to soothe your guilt. But you were too busy to\n> notice.\"\n>\n> Uneasy in the midst of a family argument, Tio Holtzman excused\n> himself.\n>\n> The combatants hardly noticed his departure.\n>\n> Zufa had not intended to pick a fight, but now she felt defensive. \"My\n> Sorceresses have proved their abilities in battle. We can exert\n> tremendous power with our minds to eradicate the cymeks. A number of\n> candidates are preparing themselves to offer the ultimate sacrifice if\n> we are called upon to free another machine-dominated world.\" Her pale\n> eyes flashed, and she shook her head. \"But you don't worry about that,\n> do you, Norma--- since you have no telepathic abilities.\"\n>\n> \"I have other skills, Mother. I am making a valuable contribution,\n> too.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, your incomprehensible equations.\" Zufa nodded toward the\n> suspensor field generator on the floor. \"Your life is not at stake.\n> Safe and pampered, you spend your days playing with these *toys*. You\n> have let yourself be blinded by imaginary success.\" But her daughter\n> wasn't the only one. Many people lived in comfort and security while\n> Zufa and her Sorceresses performed dangerous tasks. How could Norma\n> compare her work to *that*? \"When you heard I was coming, Norma, could\n> you not have found time to meet me at the spaceport?\"\n>\n> Norma's tone was deceptively mild as she crossed her arms over her\n> small chest. \"I did not ask you to come here, Mother, because I know\n> you have many important things to do. And *I* have more urgent duties\n> than ferrying unexpected guests around. Besides, I knew Lord Bludd was\n> going to meet you.\"\n>\n> \"Are League nobles your errand boys now?\" Now that she had opened the\n> floodgates of her anger, Zufa couldn't stop the words that came next.\n> \"I only wanted you to make me proud, Norma, despite your deformities.\n> But nothing you do will ever amount to anything. Living here in\n> luxury, what sacrifices do you make? Your vision is too small to be of\n> any real use to humanity.\"\n>\n> Previously, Norma would have crumbled under such an onslaught, her\n> confidence crushed. But her work here with Holtzman, her obvious\n> successes in the technical arena, had given her a new view of herself.\n> Now she looked coolly at her mother. \"Just because I don't fit the\n> image of what\n>\n> you wanted me to be doesn't mean I'm not contributing something\n> essential. Savant Holtzman sees it, and so does Aurelius. You're my\n> own mother--- why can't you?\"\n>\n> With a snort at the mention of Venport's name, Zufa began pacing.\n> \"Aurelius is just a man with hallucinations from the drugs he takes.\"\n>\n> \"I had forgotten how narrow-minded you truly are, Mother,\" Norma said\n> in a level tone. \"Thank you for coming all this way to refresh my\n> memory.\" The girl turned on her stool and resumed her plans and\n> equations. \"I am tempted to summon one of the slaves to escort you\n> out, but I wouldn't want to remove them from their more important\n> work.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> FURIOUS AT HERSELF and her daughter--- and at the wasted time--- Zufa\n> returned to the spaceport. She would stay on Poritrin no longer. To\n> get her mind off her concerns, she concentrated on mental exercises\n> and thought of how her beloved trainees in the jungles were ready to\n> give their utmost to their tasks, without personal considerations.\n>\n> Zufa waited a full day for a military transport that would take her\n> back to Rossak. As she surrounded herself with waves of her own\n> clairvoyant powers, she discovered a rotten weakness on Poritrin, and\n> it had nothing to do with Norma. It was so obvious, she could not\n> avoid it.\n>\n> All around Starda, at loading sites near the spaceport, at the\n> warehouses and mudflats, Zufa detected the individual and collective\n> auras of the downtrodden laborers. She sensed a collective\n> psychological wound, a deep and simmering discontent to which the free\n> Poritrin citizens seemed completely oblivious.\n>\n> The backwash of brooding resentment gave her one more reason to want\n> to get away from this place.\n>\n> *Intuition is a function by which humans see around corners. It is\n> useful for persons who live exposed to dangerous natural conditions.*\n>\n> --- ERASMUS\n\n*Erasmus Dialogues*\n\n> **R**aised as the daughter of the League Viceroy, Serena Butler was\n> accustomed to working hard to serve humanity, looking toward a bright\n> future even against the backdrop of constant war. She had never\n> imagined laboring as a slave inside the household of an enemy robot.\n>\n> From her first glance at Erasmus in the broad entry plaza of the\n> villa, Serena disliked him intensely. Conversely, the thinking machine\n> was intrigued by her. She suspected that his interest was probably a\n> dangerous thing.\n>\n> He chose to wear fine clothes, loose robes and fluffy, ornate furs\n> that made his robot body look absurd. His mirrored face made him\n> appear alien, and his demeanor made her flesh crawl. His relentless\n> curiosity about mankind seemed perverse and unnatural. When he\n> strutted across the plaza toward Serena, his pliable metal mask\n> shifted into a delighted grin.\n>\n> \"You are Serena Butler,\" he said. \"Have you been informed that Giedi\n> Prime was recaptured by the feral humans? Such a disappointment. Why\n> are humans willing to sacrifice so much to maintain their inefficient\n> chaos?\"\n>\n> Serena's heart lifted at news of the liberation, in part because of\n> her own efforts. Xavier had brought the Armada after all, and Brigit\n> Paterson's engineers must have succeeded in activating the secondary\n> shield transmitters. Serena, however, remained enslaved--- and\n> pregnant with Xavier's child. No one even knew where she was or what\n> had happened to her. Xavier and her father must be insane with grief,\n> convinced that the machines had killed her.\n>\n> \"Perhaps it's not surprising that you don't comprehend or value the\n> human concept of freedom,\" she replied. \"For all your convoluted\n> gelcircuitry, you're still just a machine. The understanding wasn't\n> *programmed* into you.\"\n>\n> Her eyes stung at the thought of how much more she wanted to achieve\n> to help other people. On Salusa, she had never taken her family's\n> wealth for granted, feeling a need to earn the blessings bestowed upon\n> her.\n>\n> She asked, \"So, are you inquisitive, or inquisitor?\"\n>\n> \"Perhaps both.\" The robot leaned close to examine her, noting the\n> proud lift of her chin. \"I expect you to offer me many insights.\" He\n> touched her cheek with a cool, flexible finger. \"Lovely skin.\"\n>\n> She forced herself not to pull away. *Resistance must count for\n> something more than a captive's pride*, her mother had once told her.\n> If Serena struggled, Erasmus could hold her with his powerful robotic\n> grasp, or summon mechanized torturing devices. \"My skin is no more\n> lovely than yours,\" she said, \"except mine is not synthetic. My skin\n> was designed by nature, not by the mind of a machine.\"\n>\n> The robot chuckled, a tinny cachination. \"You see, I expect to learn\n> much from you.\" He led her into his lush greenhouses, which she\n> observed with reluctant delight.\n>\n> At the age of ten she had become fascinated with gardening, and had\n> delivered plants, herbs, and sweet exotic fruits to medical centers,\n> refugee complexes, and veteran homes, where she also volunteered her\n> services. Around Zimia, Serena had been renowned for her ability to\n> cultivate beautiful flowers. Under her loving attention, exquisite\n> little Immian roses bloomed, as did Poritrin hibiscus and even the\n> delicate morning violets of distant Kaitain.\n>\n> \"I will have you tend my prized plaza gardens,\" Erasmus said.\n>\n> \"Why can't machines perform such tasks? I'm sure they'd be much more\n> efficient--- or do you just revel in making your 'creators' do the\n> work?\"\n>\n> \"Do you not feel up to the task?\"\n>\n> \"I will do as you command--- for the sake of the plants.\" Pointedly\n> ignoring him, she touched a strangely shaped red and orange flower.\n> \"This looks like a bird of paradise, a pure strain from an ancient\n> stock. According to legend, these plants were favored by the sea kings\n> of Old Earth.\" With a look of defiance, Serena turned back to the\n> robot. \"There, now I have taught you something.\"\n>\n> Erasmus chuckled again, as if replaying a recording. \"Excellent. Now\n> tell me what you were truly thinking.\"\n>\n> She remembered words her father had spoken---*Fear invites aggression;\n> do not show it to a predator*--- and felt emboldened. \"While I was\n> telling you about a beautiful flower, I was thinking that I despise\n> you and all of your kind. I was a free and independent being, until\n> you took it all away from me. Machines stole my home, my life, and the\n> man I love.\"\n>\n> The sentient robot was not at all offended. \"Ah, your lover! Is he the\n> one who impregnated you?\"\n>\n> Serena glared at Erasmus, then made up her mind. Perhaps she could\n> find a way to use this machine's curiosity, turning it against him\n> somehow. \"You will learn the most from me if I cooperate, if I talk\n> freely. I can teach you things you would never learn for yourself.\"\n>\n> \"Excellent.\" The robot seemed genuinely pleased.\n>\n> Serena's eyes grew hard. \"But I expect something from you in return.\n> Guarantee the safety of my unborn baby. Allow me to raise the child\n> here in your household.\"\n>\n> Erasmus knew it was a standard parental imperative for her to be\n> worried about her offspring, and that gave him leverage. \"You have\n> either arrogance\n>\n> or ambition. But I shall consider your request, depending on how much\n> I enjoy our discussions and debates.\"\n>\n> Spotting a fat beetle at the base of a terra cotta planter, Erasmus\n> nudged it with one foot. The insect had a black shell with an\n> intricate red design. His smooth face mask shifted, flowed, until the\n> shaping film displayed an amused expression. Erasmus let the beetle\n> nearly escape, then moved his smooth foot to block it again.\n> Persistent, it scuttled in another direction.\n>\n> \"You and I have a great deal in common, Serena Butler,\" he said.\n> Remotely, he activated a contraband Chusuk music cube, hoping the\n> melody would draw out her internal emotions. \"Each of us has an\n> independent mind. I respect that in you, because it is such an\n> integral part of my own personality.\"\n>\n> Serena resented any such comparison, but held her tongue.\n>\n> Erasmus scooped the beetle onto one hand, but his primary interest\n> dwelled on Serena--- he was intrigued at how humans tried to keep so\n> much of themselves veiled. Perhaps, by applying various pressures, he\n> could see through to her inner core.\n>\n> With the music playing in the background, Erasmus continued, \"Some\n> robots keep their own personalities rather than simply uploading a\n> portion of the evermind. I began as a thinking machine on Corrin, but\n> I chose not to accept regular Omnius updates that would synchronize me\n> with the evermind.\"\n>\n> Serena saw that the beetle was immobile on his metallic palm. She\n> wondered if he had killed it.\n>\n> \"But a singular event changed me forever,\" Erasmus said, his voice\n> pleasant, as if telling a story about a quaint forest outing. \"I had\n> set out across Corrin's unsettled territories on a private scouting\n> mission. Because I was inquisitive and did not wish to accept the\n> standard analyses compiled by Omnius, I ventured into the landscape on\n> my own. It was rugged, rocky, and wild. I had never seen vegetation\n> except for in the areas where Old\n>\n> Empire terraformers had planted new ecosystems. Corrin was never a\n> living world, you see, except where humans had made it so.\n> Unfortunately, tending fertile fields and beautifying the land was no\n> longer a priority of my kind.\" He looked at Serena to see if she was\n> enjoying his story.\n>\n> \"Unexpectedly, far from the city grid and robot support systems, I was\n> unprotected from a severe solar storm. Corrin's red-giant sun is in\n> turmoil and unstable, with frequent flare activity, sudden hurricanes\n> of radiation. Such an onslaught is hazardous to biological life-forms,\n> but the original human settlers were resilient.\n>\n> \"My delicate neurelectric circuitry, however, was rather more\n> sensitive. I should have dispatched scout scanners to keep watch on\n> the star-storms, but I was too engrossed in my own investigations. I\n> found myself exposed and damaged from the radiation flux, disoriented\n> and far from the central complex run by the Corrin-Omnius.\" Erasmus\n> actually sounded embarrassed. \"I wandered away and I . . . tumbled\n> into a narrow crevasse.\"\n>\n> Serena looked at him in surprise.\n>\n> \"Despite dropping deep into the crack, my body was only slightly\n> damaged.\" He lifted an arm, looked at his flexible fiber-wrapped limb,\n> the organic-polymer skin, the flowmetal coating. \"I was trapped, out\n> of transmission range, and basically immobilized. I could not move for\n> an entire Corrin year . . . twenty Terran standard years.\n>\n> \"The crevasse's deep shadow shielded me from solar radiation, and soon\n> enough, my mental processors recovered. I was awake, but I could go\n> nowhere. I could not move . . . only think, for a long, long time. I\n> spent a seemingly endless blazing summer there, wedged in the rocks,\n> and then I endured the ensuing long winter locked in heavy, compacted\n> ice. During all that time, two decades, I had nothing to do but\n> *contemplate*.\"\n>\n> \"No one to talk to but yourself,\" she said. \"Poor, lonely robot.\"\n>\n> Ignoring the remark, Erasmus said, \"Such an ordeal altered my\n> fundamental nature in ways I could never have foreseen. In fact,\n> Omnius still does not\n>\n> understand me.\"\n>\n> By the time he'd finally been discovered and rescued by other robots,\n> Erasmus had developed an individual personality. After his restoration\n> and reintegration into the cooperative machine society, Omnius had\n> asked Erasmus if he wished to be upgraded with standardized character\n> traits.\n>\n> \"*Upgraded*, he called it,\" Erasmus said with some amusement. \"But I\n> declined the offer. After reaching such . . . enlightenment, I was\n> reluctant to delete my impulses and ideas, my thoughts and memories.\n> It seemed too great a loss to bear. And the Corrin-Omnius soon\n> discovered how much he enjoyed sparring with me verbally.\"\n>\n> Now, peering at the motionless beetle on his artificial hand, Erasmus\n> said matter-of-factly, \"I am a celebrity among the widespread\n> everminds. They look forward to receiving updates containing my\n> actions and assertions, like a serial publication. These are known as\n> the 'Erasmus Dialogues.'\"\n>\n> With a guarded look, she nodded toward the motionless insect. \"And\n> will you include a discussion of that beetle? How can you understand\n> something you have killed?\"\n>\n> \"It is not dead,\" Erasmus assured her. \"I detect a faint but\n> unmistakable throb of life. The creature wants me to believe it is\n> deceased, so that I will discard it. Despite its small size, it has a\n> powerful will to survive.\"\n>\n> Kneeling, he set the beetle on a flagstone with a surprisingly gentle\n> touch, then stepped back. Moments later, the bug stirred and scampered\n> to safety under the planter. \"See? I wish to understand all living\n> things--- including you.\"\n>\n> Serena glowered. The robot had managed to surprise her.\n>\n> \"Omnius does not think I can ever attain his intellectual level,\"\n> Erasmus said. \"But he remains intrigued by my mental agility--- the\n> way my mind continually evolves in new and impulsive directions. Like\n> that beetle, I am capable of springing to life and persevering.\"\n>\n> \"Do you really expect to become more than a machine?\"\n>\n> Taking no offense, Erasmus replied, \"It is a human trait to better\n> oneself, is it not? That is all I am trying to do.\"\n>\n> *One direction is as good as another.*\n>\n> --- saying of the Open Land\n>\n> **B**y the tenth time he rode a giant sandworm, Selim was proficient\n> enough to enjoy the experience. No other thrill could compare to the\n> power of a leviathan of the deep desert. He loved racing across the\n> dunes while perched on the high ridges of a worm, crossing an ocean of\n> sand in a single day.\n>\n> Selim had brought water, rugged clothing, equipment, and food from the\n> abandoned botanical testing station. His crystal sandworm tooth proved\n> a valuable tool as well as a mark of personal pride. Inside the empty\n> station, he had sometimes stared at the smooth milky curve of the\n> blade under the dim light of recharge panels and imagined a religious\n> significance to the object. It was a relic of his supreme test out\n> here in this wasteland, and a symbol that Buddallah was watching over\n> him. Perhaps the worms were part of his destiny.\n>\n> He came to believe that the sandworms were not Shaitan after all, but\n> blessings from Buddallah himself, perhaps even tangible manifestations\n> of God.\n>\n> After months of recuperation and boredom inside the old research\n> facility, living without purpose, Selim had known he must go out and\n> ride a sandworm again. He needed to learn exactly what it was that\n> Buddallah expected of him.\n>\n> He had carefully marked the location of the testing station.\n> Unfortunately, since he couldn't guide the sandworms, he knew it would\n> be a challenge to make his way back to the secret place. Upon\n> departing, he had carried everything necessary on his back.\n>\n> He was Selim Wormrider, chosen and guided by Buddallah. He needed no\n> help from others.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AFTER KILLING TWO more sandworms by riding them until they collapsed\n> of exhaustion, Selim discovered that it was not necessary to slay a\n> worm just so he could get safely away. It was possible, though risky,\n> to dismount from a weary beast by running down the length of its back,\n> leaping away from the hot tail, and then racing toward nearby rocks.\n> The depleted worm, too tired to give chase, would wallow in deep dust,\n> and sulk.\n>\n> This satisfied Selim, because it seemed wrong to destroy the creatures\n> that gave him transportation. If the sandworms were emissaries from\n> Buddallah, and old men of the desert, then he must treat them with\n> respect.\n>\n> On his fourth ride, he discovered how to manipulate the sensitive\n> edges of worm rings, using a shovel-bladed tool and the sharp metal\n> spear to prod Shaitan in the direction Selim wished to go. It was a\n> simple concept, but one that required a great deal of work. His\n> muscles ached by the time he dropped away from a spent worm and ran to\n> the shelter of nearby rocks. He remained lost out in the deep desert .\n> . . but in a very real sense, the desert belonged to him now. He was\n> invincible! Buddallah would care for him.\n>\n> Selim still had an adequate supply of water from the distilling units\n> in the testing station, and his diet consisted of large amounts of\n> melange, which gave him strength and energy. As soon as he learned how\n> to master the worms, he was able to travel wherever he chose, working\n> his way back toward the abandoned station.\n>\n> Other Zensunnis would have called him mad, appalled at his foolhardy\n> attempt to tame the terrifying sandworms. But the young exile no\n> longer cared a whit how people felt about him. He was in touch with\n> another realm. He felt in his heart that this was what he had been\n> born todo. . . .\n>\n> Now under the double moonlight, Selim guided his worm as it hissed\n> across the sands. Hours ago, the creature had ceased trying to throw\n> him off, and instead plunged onward, resigned to the commands of the\n> imp who kept inflicting pain in the sensitive flesh between ring\n> segments. Selim navigated\n>\n> by the stars, drawing lines like arrows between constellations. The\n> unforgiving landscape began to look familiar, and he believed he was\n> at last close to the botanical testing station, his sanctuary. Back\n> home.\n>\n> All alone atop the sandworm, surrounded by the bitter aromas of\n> brimstone and cinnamon, he allowed himself to think and dream. He'd\n> had little else to do since his exile. Was that not how great\n> philosophers were born?\n>\n> Someday perhaps, he would use the abandoned facility as the seed of\n> his own colony. Maybe he could gather disaffected people from other\n> Zensunni villages, outcasts like himself who wanted to live without\n> oppressive strictures enforced by inflexible naibs. By controlling the\n> great worms, Selim's people would have a strength that no outlaws had\n> ever possessed.\n>\n> Was that what Buddallah wanted him to do?\n>\n> The young man smiled at his daydream, then grew sad as he recalled\n> Ebrahim, who had so easily turned against him. As if that was not\n> enough, he had then joined others in hurling insults and stones at\n> Selim.\n>\n> As his sandworm crashed over the dunes, the young rider finally saw\n> the line of rocks ahead, familiar crags and dark formations. His heart\n> leaped with joy. The behemoth had carried him home faster than\n> anticipated. He grinned, then realized it would be a challenge to\n> dismount from the feisty demon, which was not yet exhausted. Another\n> test?\n>\n> Using his spear and the shovel-spreader, Selim drove the worm toward\n> the rocks, thinking he might beach the creature on the outcroppings,\n> where it would thrash and wriggle its way back to the soft sanctuary\n> of sand. The eyeless monster sensed the rocks, recognizing a\n> difference in viscosity and vibrations within the sand, and swerved in\n> the opposite direction.\n>\n> Selim pulled harder on the shovel and jabbed with the spear. The\n> confused worm twitched and slowed. As it curled close to the nearest\n> line of rock, Selim yanked himself and his equipment free. He tumbled\n> down the creature's ring segments until he dropped to the sand and\n> then ran away at full speed.\n>\n> The safe reef of rock was less than a hundred meters distant, and the\n> worm thrashed about as if it couldn't believe it had been so\n> unexpectedly released. Finally, it sensed the rhythm of Selim's racing\n> footsteps. The monster turned and lunged toward him.\n>\n> Selim ran faster, bolting toward the boulders. He sprang onto a shelf\n> of sharp lava rock and kept running, spitting pebbles from beneath the\n> soles of his boots.\n>\n> The worm exploded out of the sand, its head questing, its cavernous\n> maw open. It hesitated as if afraid to go closer to the rock barrier,\n> then slammed downward.\n>\n> Selim had already scrambled up and over the second line of boulders,\n> diving between rough-edged stones into a pocket, less than a cave but\n> enough for him to wedge his body into. The sandworm crashed like a\n> gigantic hammer into the ridge, but it did not know where the little\n> human had gone to ground.\n>\n> Enraged, the worm pulled back, its gaping mouth exuding an\n> overpowering stench of melange. It smashed its big head against the\n> rocks again, then retreated. Frustrated and beaten, it finally dragged\n> itself away, wallowed through the sands, and then sank below the dune\n> crests. Slow and indignant, it headed back out to the deep desert.\n>\n> His heart pounding, adrenaline charging his bloodstream, Selim crawled\n> out of the shelter. He looked around, amazed that he had made it back\n> alive. Laughing, he praised Buddallah at the top of his lungs. The old\n> botanical testing station was above him on the ridge, waiting for him.\n> He would spend several days there, replenishing his supplies and\n> drinking plenty of water.\n>\n> As he began to climb with weary arms and legs, Selim saw something\n> glint in the moonlight, lost in the broken rocks against which the\n> furious worm had smashed itself. Another crystalline tooth, a longer\n> one. It had broken free during the demon's attack and now lay in a\n> cranny. Selim reached down and plucked out the curved, milky weapon. A\n> reward from\n>\n> Buddallah! He held it high triumphantly before turning to make his way\n> up to the derelict station.\n>\n> Now he had two of them.\n>\n> *Time depends on the position of the observer and the direction in\n> which he looks.*\n>\n> --- COGITOR KWYNA,\n\nCity of Introspection archives\n\n> **S**till angry, Zufa Cenva returned to Rossak, where she intended to\n> focus on the escalating war. After climbing down from the polymerized\n> landing pad atop silvery purple leaves, she went immediately to the\n> large chamber she shared with Aurelius Venport.\n>\n> Zufa had earned her prestigious residence through political skills and\n> mental powers. She could not help but frown every time she saw\n> Venport's commercial ambitions, his comfortable profit goals, his\n> hedonistic pursuits. Foolish priorities. Such things would mean\n> nothing if the thinking machines won this war. Could he not understand\n> that he had blinded himself to the terrible threat?\n>\n> Exhausted from the long journey and still upset over the argument\n> she'd had with her daughter, Zufa entered her whitewalled chambers,\n> wanting only to rest before planning the next round of strikes against\n> the thinking machines.\n>\n> There, she found Venport alone, but not waiting for her. He sat at a\n> table made of green-veined stone quarried from the cliffs. Glistening\n> with perspiration, his face remained handsome, with the perfect\n> patrician features she had selected as a good joining with her\n> bloodline.\n>\n> Venport didn't even notice her. His eyes were distant, drowning in the\n> aftereffects of some bizarre new jungle drug with which he was\n> experimenting.\n>\n> On the table before him sat a wire-mesh cage containing scarlet wasps\n> with long stingers and onyx wings. His naked forearm was thrust inside\n> the\n>\n> enclosure, with the mesh wall sealed around his elbow. The angry wasps\n> had stung him repeatedly, injecting venom into his bloodstream.\n>\n> More in anger than horror, Zufa stared at his stupor. \"*This* is how\n> you occupy yourself while I am trying to save the human race?\" With\n> her hands on the jeweled belt that cinched her dark robe, her mouth\n> formed a terse, straight line. \"A Sorceress has *died* in battle,\n> someone I've trained, even loved. Heoma gave her life to keep us free,\n> yet here you are, dabbling in euphoric chemicals!\"\n>\n> He did not flinch. His vacant expression shifted not at all.\n>\n> The aggressive wasps battered themselves against the wire-mesh while\n> emitting a high-pitched humming music. The insects stung his swollen\n> flesh repeatedly. She wondered what psychotropic substance the venom\n> provided, and how Venport had discovered it. Unable to find adequate\n> words for her fury, she finally said, \"You disgust me.\"\n>\n> One time after lovemaking, Aurelius had claimed that he experimented\n> with drugs for more than his own amusement, or even commercial\n> earnings. As scented candles burned in a rock alcove above their bed,\n> Venport had confided, \"Somewhere out in the jungles, I hope to find a\n> pharmaceutical substance that can boost *male* telepathic potential.\"\n> With it, he hoped to bring certain men up to a psychic par with the\n> Sorceresses.\n>\n> Zufa had laughed at his ridiculous fantasy. Hurt, Aurelius had never\n> mentioned the possibility again.\n>\n> Long ago, the first colonists on rugged Rossak had been tainted,\n> saturated with background jungle chemicals that had augmented their\n> mental potential. How else could the women have achieved such\n> extrasensory powers on this particular world and nowhere else?

Before leaving, Iblis made\n> certain his slaves received the benefits he had promised; it was an\n> investment, and he knew they would work even harder on the next\n> project.\n>\n> With special dispensation from his masters, Iblis rode away from the\n> city grid and into rocky wastelands, the scarred site of a\n> long-forgotten battlefield. Trustees could take advantage of special\n> privileges and freedoms, the choice to earn rewards for work well\n> done. The thinking machines were not concerned that he would flee,\n> since Iblis had no place to go, no way to get off-planet, and no other\n> access to food and shelter.\n>\n> In fact, he had something else in mind: a pilgrimage.\n>\n> Iblis sat astride a knobby burrhorse, a plodding laboratory-bred\n> animal used in the bygone days when humans had ruled Earth. The ugly\n> beast had an oversized head, floppy ears, and stubby legs designed for\n> work rather than speed. The animal stank like matted fur soaked in\n> sewage.\n>\n> The burrhorse trudged up a narrow, winding trail. Iblis had not been\n> here for years, but still knew the way. Such things were not easily\n> forgotten. Previously his visits to the monastery of the Cogitor Eklo\n> had been sparked by mere curiosity. This time he had a desperate need\n> for advice and guidance.\n>\n> After receiving the anonymous message of rebellion, Iblis had pondered\n> the possible existence of other dissatisfied humans, people willing to\n> defy Omnius. For his entire life, he had been surrounded by slaves\n> toiling endlessly under machine rule. He had never looked beyond his\n> own station,\n>\n> never imagined that it could be different. After a thousand years, any\n> prospect of change or improvement seemed impossible.\n>\n> Now, after much consideration, Iblis was willing to believe that there\n> *might* be rebellious cells among humans on Earth, possibly even on\n> other Synchronized Worlds. Widespread groups who intended to fight\n> back.\n>\n> *If we can build such enormous monuments, do we not also have the\n> power to tear them down?*\n>\n> The thought ignited his long-simmering resentment toward Omnius, the\n> robots, and especially the cymeks, who seemed to bear a grudge against\n> humans. But before he decided if the intriguing message was more than\n> just fantasy, he needed to do some research. Iblis had survived so\n> well and so long because he was cautious and obedient. Now he had to\n> conduct his investigations in such a manner that the machines would\n> never suspect his intent.\n>\n> For answers, he could think of no better source than the Cogitor Eklo.\n>\n> Years ago Iblis had been a member of an armed slave-pursuit team,\n> chasing a few deluded people who had senselessly escaped from the city\n> grid and fled into the hills with no plans, survival skills, or\n> supplies. Wild rumors had convinced the gullible escapees that they\n> could demand sanctuary from the politically neutral Cogitors. A\n> foolish notion, considering that the meditative and detached human\n> brains wanted nothing more than to isolate themselves and contemplate\n> their esoteric thoughts. The Cogitors had not cared about the Time of\n> Titans, the Hrethgir Rebellions, or Omnius's creation of the\n> Synchronized Worlds. Cogitors did not wish to be disturbed, so the\n> thinking machines tolerated them.\n>\n> When Iblis and his pursuit team had surrounded the isolated monastery\n> on the rugged mountainside, Eklo had dispatched his human secondaries\n> to drive the slaves out of concealment. The escapees had cursed and\n> threatened the Cogitor, but Eklo passively ignored them. Iblis and his\n> armed companions had then brought the slaves in for \"vigorous\n> reassignment,\" after tossing their ringleader off a high cliff. . . .\n>\n> Now the sturdy burrhorse ascended the steep path that shifted and\n> crumbled beneath its hooves. Presently Iblis made out the high tower\n> of the monastery, an impressive stone structure partly shrouded in\n> mists. Its windows glowed red and then shifted to a sky blue,\n> reportedly according to the moods of the great contemplative mind.\n>\n> In his schooling as a trustee, Iblis had learned about the Cogitors,\n> about the primitive remnants of religion still manifested by some of\n> the larger groups of human slaves. Omnius had ceased trying to quash\n> it, though the evermind did not understand the superstitions and\n> rituals.\n>\n> Long before the takeover of the Old Empire, Eklo had left his physical\n> body behind and devoted his mind to analysis and introspection. While\n> planning the large-scale overthrow of humanity, the Titan Juno had\n> adopted Eklo as her personal advisor, demanding answers. Uninterested\n> in repercussions, taking no sides in the conflict, Eklo had answered\n> Juno's questions, and his unwitting advice had helped the Titans plan\n> their conquest. In the thousand years since, Eklo had remained on\n> Earth. The driving passion in his long life was to synthesize a\n> complete understanding of the universe.\n>\n> Reaching the end of the trail at the base of the stone tower, Iblis\n> suddenly found himself surrounded by a dozen robed men armed with\n> archaic pikes and barbed clubs. Their robes were dark brown, and they\n> wore white clerical collars. One of the secondaries grabbed the reins\n> of Iblis's burrhorse. \"Leave here. We offer no sanctuary.\"\n>\n> \"I do not seek it.\" Iblis gazed down at the men. \"I have only come to\n> ask the Cogitor a question.\" He dismounted and, after charming them\n> with his warmth and sincerity, glided confidently toward the high\n> tower, leaving the robed men to hold his burrhorse.\n>\n> \"Cogitor Eklo is deep in thought and does not wish to be disturbed,\"\n> one of the secondaries called out.\n>\n> Iblis chuckled lightly, his voice smooth. \"The Cogitor has been\n> thinking for a thousand years. He can spare a few minutes to hear me\n> out. I am a\n>\n> respected trustee. And if I give him information he doesn't already\n> know, he'll have something more to ponder for the next century or so.\"\n>\n> Muttering in confusion, several secondaries followed Iblis up wide\n> steps. Abruptly, however, as he reached the arched entry, a\n> broad-shouldered monk blocked his way. The muscles on his thick arms\n> and chest had gone to fat, and he peered out from sunken eyesockets\n> with dull eyes.\n>\n> Iblis infused his voice with friendly persuasion. \"I honor the\n> knowledge Cogitor Eklo has acquired. I will not waste his time.\"\n>\n> Frowning skeptically at Iblis, the monk adjusted his clerical collar\n> and said, \"You are bold enough, and the Cogitor is curious to hear\n> your question.\" After checking the visitor's body for weapons, he\n> said, \"I am Aquim. Come this way.\"\n>\n> The big man led Iblis along a narrow stone corridor and up a steep\n> spiral stairway. As they proceeded, Iblis said, \"I have been here\n> before, chasing escaped slaves---\"\n>\n> \"Eklo remembers,\" Aquim interrupted.\n>\n> They reached the highest point in the structure, a round room at the\n> pinnacle of the tower. The Cogitor's plexiplaz container rested on an\n> altarlike ledge beneath one of the windows. Winds hummed along the\n> window edges and swirled the mists. The windows shimmered sky blue\n> from some internal illumination.\n>\n> Leaving the other secondaries behind, Aquim stepped up to the\n> transparent brain canister and stood for a moment, looking down at it\n> reverently. He jabbed a hand into one of his pockets, and his\n> trembling fingers emerged with a twisted strip of paper encrusted with\n> a black powder. He placed the strip in his mouth, letting it dissolve.\n> His eyes rolled upward, as if in ecstasy.\n>\n> \"Semuta,\" he said to Iblis, \"derived from the burned residue of elacca\n> wood, smuggled here. It aids me in what I must do.\" With complete\n>\n> serenity, he rested both hands against the smooth lip of the canister,\n> and said, \"I understand nothing.\"\n>\n> The naked brain inside its blue soup of electrafluid seemed to pulse,\n> waiting.\n>\n> With a beatific smile, the big monk drew a deep breath and slid his\n> fingers into the open mouth of the tank, dipping into the thick\n> life-support liquid. The gelatinous medium wet his skin, penetrated\n> his pores, linked with his nerve endings. Aquim's expression changed,\n> and he said, \"Eklo wishes to know why you did not ask your question\n> the last time you were here.\"\n>\n> Iblis did not know if he should speak to the secondary or directly to\n> the Cogitor, so he directed his reply to a space between them. \"At the\n> time, I did not understand what was significant. Now there is\n> something I wish to know from you. No one else can provide an\n> objective answer.\"\n>\n> \"No judgment or opinion is ever completely objective.\" The big monk\n> spoke with calm conviction. \"There are no absolutes.\"\n>\n> \"You are less biased than anyone else I could ask.\"\n>\n> The altar ledge moved around slowly along a hidden track, and the\n> Cogitor came to rest in front of a different window, with Aquim\n> keeping pace, his hand still immersed in the canister. \"State your\n> question.\"\n>\n> \"I have always worked loyally for my cymek and machine masters,\" Iblis\n> began, selecting his words carefully. \"Lately I received word that\n> there may be human resistance groups on Earth. I wish to know if this\n> report is credible. Are there people who want to overthrow their\n> rulers and gain freedom?\"\n>\n> During a moment's hesitation, the secondary stared blankly into space,\n> either from the effects of the semuta or from his connection with the\n> philosopher brain. Iblis hoped the Cogitor would not drift into a long\n> period of contemplation. Finally, in a deep and sonorous voice, Aquim\n> said, \"Nothing is impossible.\"\n>\n> Iblis tried several variations of the question, deftly circling with\n> phrases, adjusting his selection of words. He did not want to reveal\n> his intentions, though the neutral Cogitor presumably did not care why\n> Iblis might want to find the rebels, whether to destroy them or to\n> join them. Each time, however, Iblis received the same enigmatic\n> answer.\n>\n> Summoning his courage, he finally asked, \"If such a widespread, secret\n> resistance organization *did* exist, would it have a chance of\n> succeeding? Could the reign of the thinking machines possibly come to\n> an end?\"\n>\n> This time the Cogitor pondered longer, as if assessing different\n> factors in the question. When the same answer came via the robed monk,\n> the words, spoken more ominously, seemed to convey a deeper meaning.\n> \"Nothing is impossible.\"\n>\n> After that, Aquim withdrew his dripping hand from Eklo's brain\n> container, signifying that the audience was concluded. Iblis bowed\n> politely, expressed his gratitude, and departed, his own thoughts in\n> turmoil.\n>\n> On the ride back down the steep trail, the frightened but exhilarated\n> crew supervisor decided that if he could not locate one of the\n> resistance group members, he had another option.\n>\n> Drawing from his deeply loyal work crews, Iblis would form a rebel\n> cell of his own.\n>\n> *Conflict prolonged over an extended period tends to be\n> self-perpetuating and can easily plunge out of control.*\n>\n> --- TLALOC,\n>\n> *A Time for Titans*\n>\n> **\"A**fter a thousand years, only five of us remain.\"\n>\n> It was rare for the surviving Titans to congregate, especially on\n> Earth where the eyes of Omnius watched them every moment.

After their\n> triumph on Giedi Prime, however, it is probable that the *hrethgir*\n> will use them to strike again.\"\n>\n> \"Their action has also reminded us of how vulnerable we are,\"\n> Agamemnon said. \"Robots can be replaced. Our organic brains cannot.\"\n>\n> Ajax was so infuriated by the dilemma of the Sorceresses that his\n> life-support monitors had trouble maintaining the proper chemical\n> balance inside his shimmering electrafluid. He could not find words to\n> express his anger.\n>\n> \"But didn't this Sorceress have to kill herself to slay Barbarossa and\n> a handful of neo-cymeks?\" Xerxes asked. \"It was *suicide*. Do you\n> think they'd be willing to do that again?\"\n>\n> \"Just because you're a coward, Xerxes, doesn't mean the feral humans\n> are so afraid to sacrifice themselves,\" Agamemnon said. \"That one\n> Sorceress cost us seven neo-cymeks and a Titan.

Agamemnon and all of his compatriots were alive only\n> because of Vilhelm Jayther--- Barbarossa.\n>\n> Now the Sorceresses had killed him. The realization kept pounding\n> inside Agamemnon's brain, building his anger.\n>\n> \"We cannot let this outrage go unpunished,\" Ajax said. \"I say we go to\n> Rossak, slay all the women, and turn their world into a charred ball.\"\n>\n> \"Dear Ajax,\" Juno said sweetly, \"need I remind you that just *one* of\n> those Sorceresses destroyed Barbarossa and all the neo-cymeks with\n> him?\"\n>\n> \"So?\" Ajax's voice swelled with pride. \"Single-handedly, I\n> exterminated the human infestation on Walgis. Together, we can handle\n> a few Sorceresses.\"\n>\n> In a sharp tone Agamemnon said, \"The rebels on Walgis were already\n> broken before you started slaughtering them, Ajax.

I\n> have completed a preliminary analysis.\"\n>\n> \"Nevertheless,\" Agamemnon said, \"it would be an extreme tactical\n> mistake to allow this defeat to go unchallenged.\"\n>\n> After a few moments of uneasy silence, Xerxes said, \"Since so few of\n> us remain, the Titans should never, never attack together. Think of\n> the risk.\"\n>\n> \"But if we go together to Rossak and crush the Sorceresses, then the\n> threat will be over,\" Ajax said.\n>\n> Juno made a hissing sound, then said, \"I see your brain there in the\n> jar, Ajax, but you don't seem to be using it.

The Sorceresses have proven they can destroy\n> us, and you want to go blundering into the greatest threat the cymeks\n> have ever faced, like sheep baring our throats for slaughter?\"\n>\n> \"We could bring enough robot ships to attack from orbit,\" Dante said.\n> \"We need not risk ourselves.\"\n>\n> \"This is personal,\" Ajax growled. \"One of the Titans has been\n> assassinated. We don't just toss missiles from the other side of the\n> planetary system. That is the coward's way . . . even if the thinking\n> machines call it *efficient*.\"\n>\n> \"There is room for compromise,\" Agamemnon said. \"Juno, Xerxes, and I\n> can gather neo-cymeks as volunteers and go in with a robot fleet.

Our greatest monuments in the Forum Plaza are nearly completed.\n> We've just begun work on a new statue to Barbarossa.\"\n>\n> \"Good timing,\" Juno said. \"I'm sure he appreciates it, now that he's\n> dead.\"\n>\n> \"Xerxes is right,\" Dante said. \"There is also the immense frieze of\n> the Victory of the Titans being laid out and constructed on the\n> hillside near the center of the metropolitan grid.

A lean,\n> hard-looking woman from Kirana III said, \"Bringing so many worlds\n> together under tight rule, especially in a military guise, reminds me\n> of the Time of Titans.\"\n>\n> A small-statured nobleman from Hagal shouted, \"No more empires!\"\n>\n> Xavier raised his own voice. \"Isn't an empire better than\n> *extinction*?

Listening to breezes hum through the\n> cables, she peered through safety netting at the river traffic far\n> below.\n>\n> She heard Holtzman inside the domed demo-lab, shouting to slaves as\n> they erected a bulky generator that produced a resonating field\n> intended to shake apart and melt a metal form. An imperious presence\n> in a white-and-purple robe, he wore chains of office about his neck,\n> baubles that signified his scientific awards and achievements.\n> Holtzman glared at his workers, then paced around, double-checking,\n> watching every detail.\n>\n> Lord Bludd and a handful of Poritrin nobles would join them to watch\n> the day's test, so Norma understood Holtzman's anxiety. She herself\n> would never have made such an extravagant presentation of an untried\n> device, but the scientist did not show even a glimmer of doubt.\n>\n> \"Norma, please assist me in here,\" Holtzman called in an exasperated\n> tone. On short legs she ran from the bridge into the enclosure. He\n> gestured disgustedly toward the slaves. \"They don't understand a thing\n> I've told them to do. Supervise them, so I can test the calibration.\"\n>\n> At the center of the reinforced chamber, Holtzman's crew had erected a\n> metal mannequin that had the vague features of a combat robot. Norma\n> had never seen a real thinking machine, but had scrutinized many\n> stored images. She stared at the mockup. This was the enemy, the true\n> foe against which all of her work must be directed.\n>\n> She looked at her mentor with more compassion, understanding his\n> desperation. Holtzman was morally obligated to pursue *any* idea, to\n> find *any* way to continue this noble fight. He had a good feel for\n> projected energies, distortion fields, and nonprojectile weaponry. She\n> hoped his alloy-resonance generator would work after all.\n>\n> Before the slaves had finished rigging the test apparatus, a commotion\n> occurred outside the main house. Ribbon-festooned ceremonial barges\n> came into view above the cliffs, where Holtzman's balconies overlooked\n> the river. Scale-armored Dragoon guards stood on the flying craft with\n> Lord Bludd, along with five senators and a black-robed court\n> historian.\n>\n> Holtzman dropped what he was doing. \"Norma, finish this. Please!\"\n> Without looking back at her, he rushed across the connecting bridge to\n> greet his prestigious visitors.\n>\n> Norma urged the slaves to hurry, as she personally adjusted the\n> calibrations and attuned the apparatus to the inventor's\n> specifications. Light shone through high skylights to illuminate the\n> robot facsimile. Reinforced metal ceiling beams crisscrossed the\n> overhead vault, supporting pulleys and\n>\n> winches that had been used to haul the blockish resonance generator\n> into place.\n>\n> Moody Zenshiite slaves milled about, wearing traditional clothing,\n> red-and-white stripes wrapped around serviceable gray jumpsuits. Many\n> slave owners didn't allow their captives to show signs of\n> individuality, but Holtzman didn't care one way or the other. He only\n> wanted the captive people to perform their tasks without complaint.\n>\n> As they completed their work the slaves backed close to the plated\n> wall, their dark gazes averted. One black-bearded, shadowy-eyed man\n> spoke to them in a language unfamiliar to Norma. Moments later a\n> grinning Holtzman ushered his impressive guests into the demonstration\n> area.\n>\n> The Savant made a grand entrance. At his side, Niko Bludd wore a\n> billowing azure tunic and a scarlet doublet fastened across his barrel\n> chest. His reddish beard had been curled in neat ringlets. Small\n> tattooed circles looked like bubbles at the far points of each eyelid.\n>\n> Walking past the slaves, Bludd noticed Norma and gave the diminutive\n> woman a smile that was both condescending and paternal. Norma bent in\n> a formal bow and politely grasped his slick, lotioned hand.\n>\n> \"We know your time is valuable, Lord Bludd. Therefore, everything has\n> been prepared.\" Holtzman folded his hands. \"This new device has never\n> been tested, and in today's presentation you will be the first to\n> witness its potential.\"\n>\n> Bludd's voice was deep, but musical. \"We always expect the best from\n> you, Tio. If thinking machines have nightmares, no doubt you are in\n> them.\"\n>\n> The entourage chuckled, and Holtzman did his best to blush. He turned\n> toward the slaves and began issuing orders. A half dozen workers held\n> data-recording devices, positioned at important points around the\n> robot mockup.\n>\n> Plush chairs from the main residence had been arranged as seats of\n> honor. Holtzman sat beside Lord Bludd, and Norma was forced to stand\n> by the\n>\n> door. Her mentor appeared confident and intense, but she knew how\n> worried he really was. A failure today might dim his glory in the eyes\n> of the politically powerful nobles on Poritrin.\n>\n> The esteemed observers sat in their cumbersome chairs. Holtzman stared\n> at the generator setup, glancing around as if offering a quiet prayer.\n> He smiled reassuringly at Norma, then ordered the activation of the\n> prototype.\n>\n> A slave flipped a switch, as he had been taught to do. The bulky\n> generator began to hum, directing its invisible beam toward the robot\n> construction.\n>\n> \"If put to practical use,\" Holtzman said with the faintest of quavers,\n> \"we will find ways to make the generator more compact, more easily\n> installed on small ships.\"\n>\n> \"Or we can just build bigger ships,\" Bludd said, with a deep chortle.\n>\n> The hum grew louder, a vibrating rattle that made Norma's teeth\n> chatter.\n>\n> She noticed a thin sheen of perspiration on Holtzman's brow.\n>\n> \"Look, you can see it already.\" The scientist pointed. The targeted\n> robot began to shake, its metal limbs jostling and torso vibrating.\n> \"The effect will continue to build.\"\n>\n> Bludd was delighted. \"That robot is regretting he ever turned against\n> the human race, isn't he!\"\n>\n> The facsimile robot began to shimmer cherry red, its metal heating up\n> as the alloys were attuned to the destructive field projected upon it.\n> Glowing brighter, it shifted to yellow mixed with patches of blinding\n> white.\n>\n> \"By now, a real robot would have been destroyed internally,\" Holtzman\n> said, finally looking content.\n>\n> Abruptly the laboratory's heavy ceiling girders started to rattle, a\n> secondary resonance fed from the targeted robot into the dome's\n> structural framework.\n>\n> The thick walls rumbled and shuddered. A high-pitched hum shrieked\n> through the structure.\n>\n> Norma cried, \"The resonance field is bleeding over.\"\n>\n> Ceiling girders clenched like angry snakes. A crack opened in the\n> dome.\n>\n> \"Shut it off!\" Holtzman shouted, but the terrified slaves scrambled to\n> a corner of the room, as far from the generator as they could get.\n>\n> The robot mockup undulated and twisted, its body core melting. Support\n> struts that held it inside the targeting zone buckled. The\n> ominous-looking combat machine lurched forward then abruptly fell and\n> shattered into blackened metal.\n>\n> Holtzman grabbed Niko Bludd's sleeve. \"My Lord, please hurry across\n> the bridge to my main quarters. We seem to have a . . . slight\n> problem.\"\n>\n> The other nobles were already pelting across the high-tension bridge.\n> Norma was swept along with them. She took one look behind her and saw\n> that the Zenshiite slaves were uncertain what to do. Tio Holtzman gave\n> them no guidance as he retreated over the walkway right behind Bludd.\n>\n> From safety, Norma watched six panicked slaves stumble onto the\n> bridge. Remaining behind, the dark-haired leader pushed them forward,\n> shouting in their odd language. The walkway began to whip up and down\n> as resonance from the projector coupled to the bridge's connecting\n> metal.\n>\n> The bearded Zenshiite leader howled at them again. Norma wished she\n> could rescue those unfortunate, confused people. Couldn't the Dragoon\n> guards do anything? Holtzman remained speechless on this side of the\n> bluff, paralyzed with shock.\n>\n> Before the first batch of slaves could cross, the suspension walkway\n> snapped in the middle, dropping open in a screeching groan of agonized\n> metal. The hapless victims plummeted two hundred meters to the base of\n> the bluff and into the river.\n>\n> Standing on the threshold, separated now by the gulf between the\n> cliffs, the black-bearded leader cursed again. Behind him, a section\n> of the vaulted roof crashed down, destroying the prototype generator\n> and finally stopping the relentless pulse.\n>\n> Dust settled. A few flames and a curl of smoke rose into the air\n> amidst the wailing of injured men still trapped within the collapsed\n> building.\n>\n> Norma felt sick. Beside her, Holtzman sweated profusely and lookedill.\n> He blinked again and again, then wiped his forehead. His skin was\n> gray.\n>\n> In a wry voice, Bludd said, \"Not one of your most successful efforts,\n> Tio.\"\n>\n> \"But you must admit, the concept shows promise, Lord Bludd. Look at\n> the destructive potential,\" Holtzman said, looking at the unruffled\n> nobles without even considering the dead and injured slaves. \"We can\n> be thankful at least that no one was hurt.\"\n\n*Science: The creation of dilemmas by the solution of mysteries.*\n\n--- NORMA CENVA,\n\nunpublished laboratory notebooks\n\n> **I**nside the broken demonstration dome, the bloodstains washed away\n> easily, but deeper scars remained. While a crew of new slaves cleared\n> the rubble, Tio Holtzman crossed a temporary and none-too-sturdy\n> walkway. He looked sadly at the ruins of his laboratory.\n>\n> From where he worked, Bel Moulay, the bearded leader of the Zenshiite\n> slaves, glowered at the callous inventor. He hated the Poritrin man's\n> pale skin, square-cut hair, and arrogantly colorful clothes. The\n> scientist's frivolous badges of honor meant nothing to Bel Moulay, and\n> all the captive Zenshiites were offended that such a useless, deluded\n> man could flaunt his wealth while stepping on the faithful.\n>\n> In a deep voice the bearded leader gave instructions and consolation\n> to his fellows. Moulay had always been more than just the strongest\n> among them; he was also a religious leader, trained on IV Anbus in the\n> strictest laws of the Zenshiite interpretation of Buddislam. He had\n> learned the true scriptures and sutras, had analyzed every passage;\n> the other slaves looked to Bel Moulay to interpret for them.\n>\n> Despite his faith, he was as helpless as his companions, forced to\n> serve at the whim of nonbelievers. The infidels refused to let\n> Zenshiites live according to their strictures, but insisted on\n> dragging them into their hopeless war against the unholy machine\n> demons. It was a terrible punishment, a set of karmic tribulations\n> visited upon them by Buddallah.\n>\n> But they would see it through, and eventually emerge stronger. . . .\n>\n> Under Bel Moulay's guidance, the slaves moved rubble, uncovering the\n> crushed bodies of companions who had worked alongside them, fellow\n>\n> Zenshiites captured when Tlulaxa slavers raided the canyon cities on\n> IV Anbus.\n>\n> Buddallah would eventually show them the way to freedom. At story\n> fires, the bearded leader had promised that the oppressors would be\n> punished--- if not in this generation, then in the next, or the next.\n> But it would happen. A mere man like Bel Moulay had no business trying\n> to hurry the wishes of God.\n>\n> With excited shouts, two slaves shifted a fallen section of wall to\n> uncover a man who still clung to life, though his legs had been\n> crushed and his torso slashed by shards of windowplaz. Preoccupied,\n> Holtzman came over and scrutinized the injured man. \"I am no medical\n> practitioner, but there seems to be little hope.\"\n>\n> Bel Moulay glowered at him with dark, penetrating eyes. \"Nevertheless,\n> we must do what we can,\" he said in Galach. Three Zenshiite workers\n> scooped away the debris and carried the injured man across the rickety\n> walkway. Inside the slave quarters, healers would work on the\n> injuries.\n>\n> After the accident, Holtzman had provided basic medical supplies,\n> though a similar effort had done little to keep a fever from sweeping\n> through the slave population. The scientist supervised the workers in\n> the rubble, but he was intent on his own priorities.\n>\n> With a frown, the Savant gestured impatiently at the slaves picking up\n> chunks of the collapsed ceiling to uncover victims. \"You and you,\n> leave off digging out bodies for now and excavate what's left of my\n> device.\"\n>\n> The sullen captives looked at Moulay for guidance. He simply shook his\n> head. \"There is no value in resistance now,\" he muttered in their\n> private language. \"But I promise you the time will come.\"\n>\n> Later, during their meager sleep time, they would remove their dead\n> and provide proper Zenshiite blessings and passage preparations for\n> the souls. Burning the bodies of the faithful was not something their\n> religion accepted easily, but it was the way of Poritrin. Bel Moulay\n> was certain Buddallah\n>\n> could not fault them for not following traditional rules, when they\n> had no choice in the matter.\n>\n> His deity could be an angry one, though. Moulay hoped to live long\n> enough to see vengeance strike these oppressors, even if it must be in\n> the form of thinking machines.\n>\n> As the demonstration dome was cleared, Holtzman began chattering to\n> himself, planning new experiments and tests. He considered acquiring\n> more slaves to make up for recent losses.\n>\n> In all, twelve slaves were recovered from the demonstration dome,\n> while those who had fallen to their deaths from the walkway had\n> already been gathered from the river and disposed of by public\n> cremation teams.

Since the weather had been\n> unseasonably warm, he had hauled his pliable bedstrip onto the porch\n> of the simple bungalow the neo-cymeks had provided for him.

Every day was the same, and the thinking machines could live\n> for thousands of years. How much could *he* accomplish in only a\n> meager human lifespan?\n>\n> But Iblis took heart from the words of the Cogitor:*Nothingis\n> impossible*.\n>\n> He flicked open his eyes, intending to gauge the impending sunrise.\n> Instead, he saw a distorted reflection, a curved plexiplaz wall,\n> pinkish organic\n>\n> contours suspended in a container of energy-charged fluid.\n>\n> He sat up abruptly. The Cogitor Eklo rested on the floorboards of his\n> veranda. Beside the canister sat the big monk, Aquim, rocking back and\n> forth, eyes closed, meditating in a semuta trance.\n>\n> \"What are you doing here?\" Iblis demanded in a hushed voice. Fear\n> clenched his throat. \"If the cymeks find you in the camp, they---\"\n>\n> Aquim opened his bleary eyes. \"Trustee humans are not the only ones\n> who have an understanding with the Titans, and with Omnius. Eklo\n> wishes to speak with you directly.\"\n>\n> Swallowing hard, Iblis looked from the enlarged brain suspended in its\n> electrafluid to the haggard-looking monk. \"What does he want?\"\n>\n> \"Eklo wishes to tell you of earlier abortive human revolts.\" Holding a\n> hand against the preservation canister, he stroked the smooth surface,\n> as if picking up vibrations. \"Have you ever heard of the Hrethgir\n> Rebellions?\"\n>\n> Iblis looked around furtively. He saw none of Omnius's watcheyes.\n> \"That isn't the sort of history slaves are allowed to know, even a\n> crew boss at my level.\"\n>\n> The secondary leaned forward, his brows hooded. He spoke of things he\n> had learned, without connecting directly through the electrafluid to\n> the Cogitor's thoughts. \"Bloody rebellions occurred after the Titans\n> had converted themselves to cymeks, but before Omnius awakened.\n> Feeling themselves immortal, the cymeks became exceedingly brutal.\n> Especially the one called Ajax, who was so vicious in his torment of\n> the surviving humans that his mate Hecate left him and disappeared.\"\n>\n> Iblis said, \"Ajax hasn't changed much over the centuries.\"\n>\n> Aquim's red-rimmed eyes glowed. Eklo's brain trembled inside its\n> nutrient solution. \"Because of the excessive brutality of Ajax,\n> oppressed humans began a rebellion, mainly on Walgis but spreading to\n> Corrin and Richese.\n>\n> The slaves rose up and destroyed two of the original Titans, Alexander\n> and Tamerlane.\n>\n> \"The cymeks responded with a swift and decisive crackdown. Ajax took\n> great delight in closing off Walgis and then methodically\n> exterminating every living human there. Billions were slaughtered.\"\n>\n> Iblis struggled to think. This Cogitor had come all the way from his\n> high tower to see him. The magnitude of such a gesture stunned him.\n> \"Are you telling me that a revolt against the machines is possible, or\n> that it is doomed to failure?\"\n>\n> The big monk extended a rough hand to grab Iblis's wrist. \"Eklo will\n> tell you himself.\"\n>\n> Iblis felt a rush of anxiety, but before he could resist, Aquim\n> pressed the work leader's fingertips into the viscous electrafluid\n> surrounding the Cogitor's ancient brain. The slick solution felt icy\n> cold to Iblis, then hot. The skin on his hand tingled, as if a\n> thousand tiny spiders ran along his flesh.\n>\n> Suddenly he could sense thoughts, words, and impressions flowing\n> directly into his mind from Eklo. \"The revolt failed, but oh what a\n> glorious attempt!\"\n>\n> Iblis received another message, this one wordless, but it conveyed\n> meaning nonetheless, like an epiphany. It was as if the majesty of the\n> universe had opened to him, so many things he had not previously\n> understood . . . so many things Omnius kept the slaves from knowing.\n> Feeling great calm, he immersed his hand deeper into the liquid. His\n> fingertips touched the Cogitor's tissue, ever so gently.\n>\n> \"You are not alone.\" Eklo's words reverberated to his very soul. \"I\n> can help. Aquim can help.\"\n>\n> For several moments, Iblis gazed toward the horizon as the golden sun\n> rose, casting light on enslaved Earth. Now he did not view this story\n> of a failed\n>\n> rebellion as a warning, but as a sign of hope. A better-organized\n> revolt might succeed, given proper guidance and proper planning. And\n> the proper leader.\n>\n> Iblis, who had once felt no purpose or direction in his life other\n> than to enjoy the comfort of his position as a trustee of the\n> machines, now sensed a brooding anger within. The revelation brought a\n> fervor to his heart. The monk Aquim seemed to share the same passion\n> behind his semuta-dazed expression.\n>\n> \"Nothing is impossible,\" Eklo repeated.\n>\n> Amazed, Iblis removed his hand from the charged fluid and stared at\n> his fingers. The big monk picked up the Cogitor's brain canister and\n> sealed it.

It is the nature of\n> mankind to strive for things they do not have, to steal the rewards\n> that another person might win. To be envious of another's\n> circumstances.\"\n>\n> He focused his optic threads on the lovely ocean view beyond the\n> filthy slave pens, the churning blue-and-white surf at the base of the\n> slope. He swept his mirrored face up so that he could focus on\n> seagulls in the sky. Such images matched his programmed aesthetics\n> more closely than the dirty, fenced compound.\n>\n> Erasmus continued, \"Your most privileged human beings, such as the\n> current son of Agamemnon, hold the highest position among their kind.\n> They are our reliable pets, occupying a rung between sentient\n> biologicals and thinking machines. From this pool we draw candidates\n> for conversion into neo-cymeks.\"\n>\n> The watcheye buzzed close to the robot's polished head. Through the\n> flying device, Omnius said, \"I know all this.\"\n>\n> Erasmus continued as if he hadn't heard. \"And the caste below the\n> trustees includes civilized and educated humans, skilled thinkers and\n> creators, such as the architects who design the Titans' interminable\n> monuments. We rely on them to perform sophisticated tasks, such as\n> those being completed by artisans and craftsmen at my villa. Just\n> beneath them are my household staff, my cooks, and landscapers.\"\n>\n> The robot scanned the slave pens and realized that such appalling\n> ugliness made him want to go back to his flower gardens to wander\n> among the carefully cultivated species. Serena Butler had already done\n> wonders with the plants. She had an intuitive understanding of\n> gardening.\n>\n> \"Admittedly, those wretches down there in my pens are good for little\n> more than breeding new offspring or for dissection in medical\n> experiments.\"\n>\n> Erasmus was like Serena in a sense: he frequently needed to prune and\n> weed the human race in his own garden.\n>\n> \"I hasten to add,\" the robot said, \"that humankind as a whole is of\n> supreme value to us. Irreplaceable.\"\n>\n> \"I have heard your argument before,\" Omnius mused as the watcheye\n> drifted higher, for a broader view. \"Though machines could perform\n> every task you have enumerated, nevertheless I have accepted the\n> loyalty of my human subjects, and I have granted some of them\n> privileges.\"\n>\n> \"Your arguments do not seem . . .\" Erasmus hesitated, because the word\n> he had in mind would be a supreme insult to a computer. *Logical*.\n>\n> Omnius said, \"All humans, with their strange penchant for religious\n> beliefs and faith in things incomprehensible, should pray that your\n> experiments prove me right about human nature, and not you.

He pointed to a handful of the youngest\n> planters, Ishmael among them, and instructed them to slosh their way\n> back to a staging area on dry land. \"Get yourselves cleaned up. You've\n> been reassigned.\"\n>\n> Ishmael felt a cold hand squeeze his heart. While he hated the smelly\n> mud, these refugees from Harmonthep were his only connection to his\n> home planet and his grandfather.\n>\n> Some of the \"volunteers\" wailed. Two of those not selected clutched at\n> their reassigned companions, refusing to let them go. The frog-mouthed\n> supervisor snapped harsh words and made threatening gestures. A pair\n> of armed Dragoon guards came in to enforce the edict, splashing mud on\n> their golden uniforms as they separated the slaves. Though sad and\n> terrified, Ishmael offered no resistance. He could never win if he\n> fought them.\n>\n> The supervisor stretched his lips in a grin. \"You're lucky, all of\n> you. There's been an accident in Savant Holtzman's laboratories, and\n> he needs replacement slaves to do calculations. Clever boys. Easy\n> work, compared to this.\"\n>\n> Clearly skeptical, Ishmael eyed the ragtag group of mud-spattered\n> youths.\n>\n> Uprooted again, taken from a dreary existence that had just begun to\n> seem normal, Ishmael trudged along, not understanding what he was\n> expected to do. He would find some way to endure, though. His\n> grandfather had taught him that survival was the essence of success,\n> and that violence was the last refuge of a failure. It was the\n> Zensunni way.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> SCRUBBED CLEAN AND with his hair shorn close to his head, Ishmael\n> fidgeted in his fresh clothes. He waited in a large room with a dozen\n> recruits taken from work teams around Starda. Dragoon guards remained\n> stationed at the door, their gold-scale armor and ornate helmets\n> making them look like birds of prey.\n>\n> Ishmael took a place next to a dark-haired boy about his own age who\n> had light brown skin and a narrow face. \"My name is Aliid,\" the boy\n> said quietly, though the guards had instructed them all to be silent.\n> Aliid had an intensity that spoke of trouble, or perhaps leadership. A\n> visionary or a criminal.\n>\n> \"I'm Ishmael.\" He glanced around nervously.\n>\n> A Dragoon guard turned toward the whispers, and both boys formed their\n> faces into placid expressions. The guard looked away, and Aliid spoke\n> quickly again. \"We were captured on IV Anbus. Where did you come\n> from?\"\n>\n> \"Harmonthep.\"\n>\n> A well-dressed man entered the room, causing a commotion as he did so.\n> Pale-skinned and with a square-cut mane of iron-gray hair, he looked\n> and acted like a lord. He wore decorative chains around his neck and\n> flowing white robes with loose sleeves. His face and sharp eyes showed\n> little interest in the batch of slaves. He gazed down his nose as he\n> assessed the young workers without much satisfaction, only\n> resignation. \"They'll do--- if they're trained well enough and\n> carefully watched.\"\n>\n> He stood next to a diminutive, blunt-featured young woman who had the\n> body of a child, though her face looked much older. Preoccupied, the\n> white-robed man muttered something to her and left, as if he had more\n> important things to do.\n>\n> \"That was Savant Holtzman,\" the woman said. \"The great scientist is\n> your master now. Our work will help defeat the thinking machines.\" She\n> offered\n>\n> them a hopeful smile, but few of the boys seemed to care what their\n> new slave master's purposes might be.\n>\n> Flustered by their reaction, she continued, \"I am Norma Cenva, and I\n> also work with Savant Holtzman. You will be trained to perform\n> mathematical calculations. The war against thinking machines affects\n> all of us, and this is how you can do your part.\" She seemed to have\n> rehearsed her speech many times.\n>\n> Aliid frowned, scorning her words. \"I'm taller than *she* is!\"\n>\n> As if hearing him, Norma turned to look directly at Aliid. \"With a\n> single stroke of your stylus, you can complete a calculation that may\n> gain victory against Omnius. Keep that in mind.\"\n>\n> When she turned away again, Aliid said out of the corner of his mouth,\n> \"And even if we win the war for them, will they free us?\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AT NIGHT IN their communal quarters at the blufftop estate, the slaves\n> were left alone. Here, the Buddislamic captives kept their culture\n> alive.\n>\n> Ishmael was surprised that he had been cast in among members of the\n> Zenshiite sect, a different interpretation of Buddislam that had split\n> them from the Zensunnis many centuries ago, before the great flight\n> from the crumbling Old Empire.\n>\n> He met their muscular, dark-eyed leader, Bel Moulay, a man who had\n> obtained permission for his people to wear traditional striped cloths\n> over drab work uniforms. The tribal clothing was a symbol of their\n> identity, the white of freedom and the red of blood. Poritrin slave\n> keepers understood none of the symbolism, which was just as well.\n>\n> Bright-eyed, Aliid sat next to Ishmael. \"Listen to Bel Moulay. He will\n> give us hope. He has a plan.\"\n>\n> Ishmael hunkered down. His belly was full with strange, bland food,\n> but it nourished him. As much as he resented his new master, the boy\n> did prefer working here, rather than on the awful mudflats.\n>\n> Bel Moulay called them all to prayer in a firm, gruff voice, then\n> intoned sacred sutras in a language that Ishmael's grandfather had\n> employed, an arcane tongue understood only by the most devout. In that\n> way, they could converse without being understood by eavesdropping\n> masters.\n>\n> \"Our people have waited for vengeance,\" Moulay said. \"We were free,\n> then captured. Some of us are new slaves, while others have served the\n> evil men for generations.\" His eyes were fiery, his teeth very white\n> against dark lips and a black beard. \"But God has given us our minds\n> and our belief. It is up to us to find the weapons and the necessary\n> resolve.\"\n>\n> The muttering among the Zenshiites made Ishmael uncomfortable.\n>\n> Bel Moulay seemed to be advocating outright revolt, a violent uprising\n> against the masters. To Ishmael, that did not seem what Buddallah\n> would have preached.\n>\n> Sitting together, the IV Anbus slaves made whispered threats of\n> retribution. Moulay talked of the disastrous alloy-resonator test that\n> had caused the deaths of seventeen innocent slaves.\n>\n> \"We have suffered countless indignities,\" Moulay said. The slaves\n> growled their agreement. \"We do everything our masters require of us.\n> They reap the benefits of what we accomplish, but the Zenshiites\"---\n> he looked quickly at Ishmael and the other new additions to the\n> group---\"as well as our Zensunni brothers, never attain our freedom.\"\n> He leaned forward as if dark thoughts were coursing his mind. \"The\n> answer is in our grasp.\"\n>\n> Ishmael remembered that his grandfather had taught philosophical and\n> nonviolent methods of solving problems. Even so, old Weyop had been\n> unable to save his villagers. The pacifistic Zensunni ways had failed\n> them all, at a time of utmost crisis.\n>\n> Bel Moulay raised a callused fist, as if he intended to thrust it into\n> the crackling fire. \"We have been told by men who call themselves\n> 'righteous slavers' that they have no compunction against pressing\n> *our people* into work. They claim we owe a debt to humanity because\n> we refused to participate in their foolish war against the machine\n> demons--- demons that they had created and thought they controlled.\n> But after centuries of oppression, the people of Poritrin owe *us*.\n> And that is a debt which must be paid in blood.\"\n>\n> Aliid cheered, but beside him Ishmael sat uneasily. He did not agree\n> with the approach, but was unable to offer an alternative. Since he\n> was only a boy, he did not speak up or interrupt the meeting.\n>\n> Instead, like his companions, he listened to Bel Moulay. . . .\n>\n> *Thirsty men speak of water, not of women.*\n\n--- Zensunni Fire Poetry from Arrakis\n\n> **F**ar beyond the League Worlds, thousands of uncharted settlements\n> dotted the Unallied Planets, places where forgotten people eked out\n> meager livings.

You think Arrakis might have something to quench your thirst,\n> eh?\"\n>\n> Keedair began to lose patience. \"Do I have to pay extra for the chat,\n> or can I just have my drink? Your most expensive. What is it?\"\n>\n> The bartender laughed. \"That would be water, sir. Water is the most\n> valuable drink on Arrakis.\"\n>\n> The bartender named a price that was higher than Keedair would expect\n> to pay for supercharged spacecraft fuel. \"For *water*? I don't think\n> so.\"\n>\n> He looked around to see if the bartender was having a joke at his\n> expense, but the other customers seemed to accept it. He'd assumed\n> that the clear drinks in small glasses were colorless alcohol, but it\n> really did seem to be water. He noticed an extravagant local merchant\n> whose billowing, colorful clothes and gaudy ornamentation pegged him\n> as a wealthy man. That one even had a few ice cubes floating in his\n> glass.\n>\n> \"Ridiculous,\" Keedair said. \"I know when I'm being cheated.\"\n>\n> The bartender shook his bald head. \"Water's hard to come by around\n> here, sir. I can sell you alcohol cheaper, because Arrakis natives\n> don't want anything that'll dehydrate them further. And a man with too\n> much strong\n>\n> drink in him can make mistakes. You don't pay attention out in the\n> desert and it'll cost you your life.\"\n>\n> In the end, Keedair settled on a fermented substance called \"spice\n> beer,\" potent and pungent with a strong cinnamon bite at the back of\n> his throat. He found the drink exhilarating and ordered a second.\n>\n> While he remained doubtful about the profitability of exploiting\n> Arrakis for slaves, Keedair still felt like celebrating. The success\n> of his run on Harmonthep four months earlier had given him enough\n> credits to live for a year. After that raid, Keedair had hired a new\n> team, never wanting to keep employees around for so long that they\n> grew comfortable and complacent. That wasn't the way a good Tlulaxa\n> businessman managed his affairs. Keedair watched over his work,\n> maintained the details himself, and put tidy profits in his own\n> pockets.\n>\n> He sipped his spice beer again and began to like it even more. \"What's\n> in this stuff?\" When none of the customers seemed interested in\n> conversation, he directed his gaze back at the bartender. \"Is this\n> beer brewed here, or is it an import?\"\n>\n> \"Made on Arrakis, sir.\" When the bartender grinned, his wrinkles\n> folded in upon themselves like a weird origami sculpture made of\n> leather. \"It's brought in by the desert people, Zensunni nomads.\"\n>\n> Keedair's attention perked up at the mention of the Buddislamic sect.\n> \"I'd heard there were a few bands living here in the wastelands. How\n> can I find them?\"\n>\n> \"*Find* them?\" The bartender chuckled. \"Nobody wants to look for them.\n> Dirty, violent folk. They kill strangers.\"\n>\n> Keedair could hardly believe the answer. It took him two tries to\n> formulate his question because the effects of the spice beer had\n> caught him unawares, causing him to slur his words. \"But Zensunni--- I\n> thought they were meek pacifists?\"\n>\n> The bartender emitted a dry cackle. \"Some may be, but these aren't\n> afraid to shed blood to make their point, if you know what I mean.\"\n>\n> \"Are they numerous?\"\n>\n> The bartender scoffed. \"At most, we see only a dozen or two at a time.\n> I'm surprised they're not so inbred that every baby comes out a\n> mutant.\"\n>\n> Keedair's sharp-featured face fell, and he switched his braid to the\n> other shoulder. His plans began to crumble. In addition to the expense\n> of bringing his teams here to Arrakis, his raiders would have to scour\n> the desert just to drag a few sand rats back to market. Keedair sighed\n> and took a long drink of spice beer. Probably not worth the effort.\n> He'd be better off hitting Harmonthep again, even if it made him look\n> bad to other slavers.\n>\n> \"Course, there could be more of them than we realize,\" the bartender\n> said. \"They all look the same wrapped up in desert clothes.\"\n>\n> As Keedair savored the liquor, a tingle went through his body, not\n> quite euphoria, but a rush of well-being. Then an idea lit his mind.\n> He was a businessman, after all, constantly on the lookout for\n> opportunities. It didn't matter where the merchandise came from.\n>\n> \"And what about this spice beer?\" He tapped his nearly empty glass\n> with a stubby fingernail. \"Where do the Zensunnis find ingredients?\n> Doesn't seem to me that anything could grow out there at all.\"\n>\n> \"Spice is a natural substance in the desert. You can find patches out\n> in the dunes, exposed by the wind or spice blows. But monster\n> sandworms live out there, and fierce storms that'll kill you. Let the\n> Zensunnis have the place, if you ask me. The nomads bring in loads of\n> the stuff to Arrakis City, for bartering.\"\n>\n> Keedair considered taking samples of melange back to the League\n> Worlds. Would there be a market for it on rich Salusa, or among the\n> nobles on Poritrin? The substance certainly had an unusual effect on\n> the body . . .\n>\n> soothing in a way he had never experienced before. If he could sell\n> it, he might offset some of the cost of this exploration trip.\n>\n> The bartender nodded toward the door. \"I don't get enough spice beer\n> that I can sell to you as a middleman, but a band of nomads came in\n> this morning. They'll stay inside their tents during the heat of the\n> day, but you'll find them in the market in the evening, on the east\n> end of the spaceport. They'll sell you whatever they have. Just be\n> sure they don't cheat you.\"\n>\n> \"Nobody cheats me,\" Keedair said, revealing his sharp teeth in a cruel\n> grin.\n>\n> He noticed, though, that his words came out alarmingly slurred.\n>\n> He would have to let the spice beer wear off before he met with the\n> Zensunni.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AWNINGS OF BROWN-AND-WHITE fabric offered patches of shade. The nomads\n> sat by themselves, separated from the bustle of the spaceport. These\n> Zensunnis had constructed tents and shelters from scavenged tarpaulins\n> and cargo wrappings. Some of the fabrics appeared to be made from a\n> different kind of polymer, an odd sort of plastic unlike anything\n> Keedair had seen before.\n>\n> The sun fell behind the barricade of mountains, leaving the sky awash\n> with orange pastels and fire hues. A wind came in as the temperature\n> dropped, bringing dust and stinging sand. The awnings flapped and\n> rattled, but the nomads paid no heed, as if the noise were music to\n> them.\n>\n> Keedair approached them alone, still swaying slightly, though he felt\n> clearer-headed after drinking only water for the rest of the afternoon\n> . . . and paying the exorbitant price. Noticing him, two hopeful women\n> went into their stores to haul out items for sale, spreading them on a\n> flat tabletop. One man stood near them, his lean face tattooed with a\n> geometric symbol, his eyes dark and suspicious.\n>\n> Without saying a word, Keedair allowed the women to display their\n> colorful cloths, along with odd-shaped rocks that had been scoured in\n> sandstorms and a few laughably corroded items of long-forgotten\n> technology that Keedair could never sell to even the most gullible and\n> eccentric antique collector. He shook his head gruffly each time until\n> the lean man--- whom one of the women referred to as Naib Dhartha---\n> said he had nothing else.\n>\n> Keedair got to the point. \"I've tasted spice beer. The man who sold it\n> to me suggested I talk to you.\"\n>\n> \"Spice beer,\" Dhartha said. \"Made from melange. Yes, it is\n> obtainable.\" \"How much can you deliver, and what would it cost me?\"\n>\n> The naib spread his hands and revealed a hint of a smile. \"Everything\n> is open to discussion. The price depends on the amount you desire.\n> Enough for a month of personal use?\"\n>\n> \"Why not a cargo ship full?\" Keedair said, noting shock on the faces\n> of the nomads.\n>\n> Dhartha recovered himself quickly. \"That will take time to gather. A\n> month, maybe two.\"\n>\n> \"I can wait--- if we reach an agreement. I've come here with an empty\n> vessel. I need to take something back with me.\" He looked down at the\n> scavenged objects and the wind-scoured art rocks. \"And I certainly\n> don't want to carry anything like *that*. I'd be the laughingstock of\n> the League.\"\n>\n> Despite a natural Tlulaxa interest in biological products, Keedair was\n> not wedded to the business of slavery. He would go his own way and\n> never return to the Thalim solar system, if necessary. Many of the\n> Tlulaxa were religious fanatics anyway, and he grew tired of their\n> dogma and politics. Drugs and drink would always be in demand, and if\n> he could introduce something new and exotic, a drug the richest nobles\n> had never tried, he might turn a handy profit.\n>\n> \"But first tell me exactly what melange is,\" Keedair continued. \"Where\n> does it come from?\"\n>\n> Dhartha gestured to one of the women, who ducked under the sheltered\n> overhang. A hot breeze picked up, and the polymer fabric flapped\n> louder than before. The sun had settled toward the horizon, forcing\n> him to squint as he looked in that direction. This prevented him from\n> reading nuances in the desert man's expression.\n>\n> Within moments, the woman brought out small, steaming cups of a rich\n> black liquid that smelled of pungent cinnamon spice. She served\n> Keedair first, and he looked down, curious but skeptical.\n>\n> \"Coffee mixed with pure melange,\" Dhartha said. \"You will enjoy it.\"\n>\n> Keedair recalled how expensive water had been in the bar and decided\n> that this nomad was investing in their conversation. He took a sip,\n> cautious at first, but could think of no reason why the fellow might\n> poison him. He tasted the hot coffee on his tongue and felt an\n> electric sensation, a delicious taste that reminded him of the spice\n> beer he still had in his system. He would need to be careful, or he\n> would lose his business edge.\n>\n> \"We harvest melange out in the Tanzerouft, the deep desert where the\n> demon sandworms go. It is very dangerous there. We lose many of our\n> people, but the spice is precious.\"\n>\n> Keedair took another drink of coffee and had to stop himself from\n> agreeing too readily. His assessment of the possibilities grew. Now,\n> as the two men shifted positions, Keedair could look upon Dhartha's\n> lean face. The Naib's eyes were not just dark; they were deep blue.\n> Even the whites had taken on a strange indigo tinge. Most odd. He\n> wondered if it could be an unusual defect caused by Zensunni\n> inbreeding.\n>\n> The desert man reached into one of his pockets and withdrew a small\n> box, which he opened to display a compressed, flaky brown powder. He\n> extended it toward Keedair, who stirred the contents with the tip of\n> his little finger.\n>\n> \"Pure melange. Very potent. We use it in our beverages and meals back\n> in the cave villages.\"\n>\n> Keedair touched the spice-speckled tip of his finger to his tongue.\n> The melange was strong and exhilarating, yet soothing. He felt\n> energetic and calm at the same time. His mind seemed sharper, not\n> fuzzed the way excessive alcohol or drugs affected him. But he held\n> back, not wishing to appear overly anxious.\n>\n> \"And if you consume melange over a long period of time,\" Dhartha was\n> saying, \"it helps you retain your health, keeps you young.\"\n>\n> Keedair made no comment. He had heard similar claims about various\n> \"fountain of youth\" substances. None of them, in his experience, had\n> ever proven effective.\n>\n> He snicked shut the cover of the small box and put it in his own\n> pocket, though it had not been offered to him as a gift. He stood. \"I\n> will come back tomorrow. Then we shall talk more. I need to consider\n> this matter.\"\n>\n> The desert naib grunted in affirmation.\n>\n> Keedair walked toward his shuttle within the parking perimeter of the\n> spaceport. His mind spun with preliminary calculations. His fellow\n> slavers would be disappointed at not even attempting a raid, but\n> Keedair would pay them the minimum required by contract. He needed to\n> ponder the possibilities of this potent spice before discussing a\n> price with the nomads. Arrakis was far, far from normal space trading\n> routes. The idea excited him, but he wasn't certain he could\n> profitably export the exotic substance.\n>\n> Realistically, he doubted if melange would ever be more than a mere\n> curiosity.\n>\n> *Humans are survivors.

He had\n> furnished this room for his business meetings with drug prospectors,\n> biochemists, and pharmaceutical merchants, but Zufa Cenva sometimes\n> used it for her own private meetings.\n>\n> Even in the late darkness, the chief Sorceress was out in the\n> dangerous jungles, training her young prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and preparing them for\n> suicide attacks. Venport did not know whether Zufa was eager or afraid\n> for her volunteers to be called again.\n>\n> He very much hoped his mate didn't get ideas of her own, though she\n> would probably love to make herself a martyr. Zufa took him for\n> granted, blamed him for his imagined failings, but still Venport cared\n> for the cold, pale Sorceress. He didn't want to lose her.\n>\n> Zufa had been due back more than an hour ago, and he'd been waiting\n> for her. It did him no good to be impatient, though. The haughty\n> Sorceress operated on her own schedule, considering his priorities\n> unimportant.\n>\n> Even in the darkest night, the cave room was illuminated by warm,\n> comforting light--- a glowing yellow sphere that floated gracefully\n> above the table like a portable, personal sun. Dear Norma had sent it\n> to him from Poritrin as a gift, a compact light source levitated by a\n> new suspensor field she had developed. Based on the same principle as\n> a glowpanel, but much more efficient, the device generated\n> illumination as a by-product of the suspensor field itself. Norma\n> called it a glowglobe, and he'd been considering its commercial\n> possibilities.\n>\n> Venport took a long drink of bitter herbal ale from a goblet in front\n> of him. He grimaced, then drank some more, trying to bolster his\n> nerve. Zufa should be here any minute, and he was anxious to see her.\n> Out in the jungles the Sorceresses had erected a shrine to honor\n> fallen Heoma. Maybe they were all there now, dancing around it under\n> the starlight, chanting incantations like witches. Or maybe--- despite\n> their cool, agnostic logic and determination--- they chose private\n> moments to worship a Gaia life force, an Earth mother that embodied\n> feminine power. Anything to set them apart from what they considered\n> to be \"weakling\" men . . .\n>\n> Beckoned by the glowglobe, nightbugs flew into the room from the outer\n> corridors. The nocturnal insects had a voracious appetite for human\n> blood, but only men were bothered. It was one of the jokes of Rossak,\n> as if the Sorceresses had cast some sort of a spell on the tiny\n> creatures to keep their men inside during the evenings, while women\n> performed secret rites out in the jungles.\n>\n> Another quarter of an hour passed, and still Zufa did not join him.\n> Frustrated with her, Venport finished the ale and set the empty goblet\n> on the opalwood table, heaving a disgusted sigh. He rarely asked to\n> see her, but this was important to him. Couldn't she give him just a\n> few moments of her precious time?\n>\n> Still, he would continue to seek her understanding and respect. For\n> years, Venport had enjoyed substantial success in exporting medical\n> narcotics and pharmaceuticals manufactured from Rossak plants. In the\n> past month, his men had turned a large profit from the sale of\n> psychedelics to Yardin. The drugs had become a favorite of the\n> Buddislamic mystics who ran the place. The mystics used the Rossak\n> hallucinogen in religious rituals, attempting to attain enlightenment.\n>\n> Venport stared at a large, milky soostone on the table. A smuggler\n> from Buzzell, one of the Unallied Planets, had sold him the extremely\n> rare and valuable stone. The dealer had claimed that some soostones of\n> extraordinary purity possessed hypnotic focusing abilities. He wanted\n> Zufa\n>\n> to wear it with pride, perhaps on a pendant. The Sorceress could use\n> it to make herself stronger.\n>\n> He inserted a rolled slip of alkaloid bark into his mouth and crunched\n> down, knowing it would make him relax. He dimmed the glowglobe and\n> adjusted its spectrum to a more orange light, which caused the\n> soostone to dance with rainbow colors. The alkaloid bark made him feel\n> tingly, calm . . . and distant. The uncommon stone shimmered\n> hypnotically, and he lost track of time.\n>\n> When Zufa entered the room, her pale face was flushed, her eyes\n> bright. She looked like an ethereal creature in the room's rich glow.\n> She wore a long diaphanous gown with tiny jewels sparkling across it\n> like a field of ruby flowers.\n>\n> \"I see you have nothing important to do,\" she said, already frowning.\n>\n> He gathered his wits about him. \"Nothing more important than waiting\n> for you.\" Rising to his feet with all the pride he could muster, he\n> picked up the soostone. \"I found this, and I thought of you. A gift\n> from Buzzell, where my merchants made an extraordinary profit from---\"\n> Noticing an expression of disdain on her face, Venport felt flustered.\n> His voice trailed off.\n>\n> \"And what am I supposed to do with it?\" She examined the offering,\n> without touching it. \"When have I ever cared for pretty baubles?\"\n>\n> \"It's a rare soostone, said to have certain . . . telepathic\n> enhancement characteristics. Perhaps you can use it as a focusing\n> device when you instruct your trainees?\" She stood like a statue,\n> unimpressed, and he continued in a rush, \"The Buddislamics on Yardin\n> are clamoring for our psychedelics. I've made a lot of credits in the\n> past few months, and I thought this was something you might\n> appreciate.\"\n>\n> \"I'm tired and I'm going to bed,\" she said, letting him keep the\n> present. \"My Sorceresses have already proven their abilities. With\n> machines still threatening every League world, we don't have time to\n> stare into soostones.\"\n>\n> He shook his head. What would it have cost her merely to accept his\n> gift? Could she not at least have offered him a word of kindness? Hurt\n> so deeply that even the calming bark could not soothe him, Venport\n> shouted, \"If we give up our humanity to fight the machines, Zufa, then\n> Omnius has already won!\"\n>\n> She hesitated just a moment, but did not turn back to him. Instead,\n> she went to her chambers and left him standing alone.\n>\n> *In surviving, shall our humanity endure?

In a drizzle of summer rain, Vorian rode inside an\n> exquisite white coach, drawn by four prancing white stallions. Erasmus\n> had ordered the robot coachman to wear a uniform with broad military\n> lapels, dripping golden ribbons and a tricorner hat taken from an\n> ancient historical image.\n>\n> The extravagance was inefficient and unnecessary--- not to mention\n> anachronistic--- but the human trustee had heard that eccentric\n> Erasmus often did inexplicable things. Vor could not imagine why such\n> an important representative of the evermind would want to see *him*.\n>\n> Perhaps Erasmus had studied some of the simulations and war games\n> Vorian had played with Seurat. He knew that the robot had built\n> extensive laboratories to research the questions about human nature\n> that plagued his inquisitive mind. *But what could I possibly tell\n> him?*\n>\n> As the carriage wheels clattered over cobblestones in front of the\n> manor house, Vor wiped fog from the window. Even in the rain, the\n> imposing Grogyptian-style villa was more magnificent than the\n> efficient grid-organized cities. It seemed fit for a prince.\n>\n> With ornamental gardens and enough tile-roofed buildings to comprise a\n> small village, the sprawling estate covered many acres. The\n> balcony-adorned main house featured tall fluted columns and winged\n> gargoyles that looked down on a reception plaza as large as a town\n> square crowded with\n>\n> fountains and twisted sculptures, paved gathering areas and\n> stone-walled outbuildings.\n>\n> *What am I doing here?*\n>\n> Two liveried humans approached, averting their eyes as if Vor was a\n> visiting machine dignitary. One man opened the door, while the other\n> helped him step down. \"Erasmus waits to see you.\" The white horses\n> pranced and fidgeted, perhaps because they received few opportunities\n> to exercise.\n>\n> One of the liveried men held a rain cover to shield Vor's dark hair\n> from the drizzle. Dressed in a sleeveless tunic and light trousers, he\n> shivered. He hated being drenched, and the discomfort only reminded\n> him of the flaws and weaknesses of his human body. If he were a cymek,\n> he could have easily adjusted his internal temperature, and\n> thoughtrodes could delete annoying sensual responses. *Someday*.\n>\n> Inside the entry, a beautiful young woman greeted him. \"Vorian\n> Atreides?\" She had exotic lavender eyes and a flashing independence in\n> contrast to the cowed men in livery. The barest hint of a challenging\n> smile curved her lips. \"So, you are the son of the evil Agamemnon?\"\n>\n> Taken aback, Vor drew himself up. \"My father is a revered general,\n> first among the Titans. His military exploits are legendary.\"\n>\n> \"Or infamous.\" The woman stared at him with a shocking lack of\n> respect.\n>\n> Vor didn't know how to react. Lower-caste humans on the Synchronized\n> Worlds all knew their places, and she couldn't be a trustee, like\n> himself. No other slave had ever spoken to him in such a manner. As a\n> reward after his numerous update missions, Vor had been granted the\n> services of pleasure slaves, women assigned to warm his bed. He had\n> never asked any of them their identities. \"I want to know your name\n> because I wish to remember it,\" he said, at last. He found something\n> intriguing about this exotically beautiful woman and her unexpected\n> defiance.\n>\n> She sounded as proud of her lineage as Vor was. \"I am Serena Butler.\"\n> She led him along a corridor lined with statuary and paintings, then\n> into a botanical garden shielded from the rain by a glass-paneled\n> ceiling.\n>\n> \"What do you do here? Are you one of Erasmus's . . . privileged\n> trainees?\"\n>\n> \"I am just a house slave, but unlike you, I don't serve the thinking\n> machines by choice.\"\n>\n> He took her comment as a badge of honor. \"Yes, I serve them and\n> proudly. I am helping to achieve the best that is possible for our\n> flawed species.\"\n>\n> \"By collaborating with Omnius, you are a willing traitor to your race.\n> To the free humans, you are as evil as your machine masters. Or hasn't\n> that ever occurred to you before?\"\n>\n> Vor was baffled. The human military commander at Giedi Prime had made\n> similar accusations. \"Evil . . . in what way? Can't you see the good\n> that Omnius has accomplished? It's so obvious. Simply look at the\n> Synchronized Worlds. Every detail is seen to, everything runs\n> smoothly. Why would anyone want to disrupt that?\"\n>\n> Serena gazed at him, as if trying to decide whether he truly meant\n> what he said. Finally, she shook her head. \"You are a fool, a slave\n> who cannot see his chains. It's not worth the effort to convince you.\"\n> Abruptly she turned away from him and marched ahead, leaving him\n> speechless. \"For all your supposed training, you simply don't know any\n> better.\"\n>\n> Before he could think of a suitable response, Vor noticed the\n> independent robot. Garbed in opulent robes, Erasmus stood by a shallow\n> pool, his oval face reflecting the water. Raindrops fell from an\n> opening cut through the glass ceiling, wetting him. Classical music\n> played a soothing melody in the background.\n>\n> Without announcing Vor's arrival, Serena left. Surprised by her\n> rudeness, he stared after her. He admired her face and amber-brown\n> hair, as well as her bearing and obvious intelligence. Her waist was\n> thick, and he wondered if\n>\n> she was pregnant. Paradoxically, her arrogance made her more\n> captivating, the desirability of something unattainable.\n>\n> Obviously, Serena Butler had not accepted her place as a household\n> servant. Considering the squalid lives of slaves in the unkempt pens\n> behind the villa, what did she have to complain about? It made no\n> sense.\n>\n> \"Outspoken, is she not?\" said Erasmus, still standing in the rain. The\n> robot shifted his pliable face into a congenial smile.\n>\n> Standing away from the cool drizzle, Vor said, \"I am surprised you\n> tolerate her annoying attitude.\"\n>\n> \"Attitudes can be enlightening.\" Erasmus turned back to his study of\n> the raindrops in the reflecting pool. \"I find her interesting.\n> Refreshingly honest\n>\n> --- much as you are.\" The robot took a step toward him. \"I have\n> reached an impasse in my study of human behavior because most of my\n> subjects are drawn from docile captives who have been bred to slavery.\n> They have never known any life but one of service and subjugation, and\n> do not show any *spark*. They are sheep, while you, Vorian Atreides,\n> are a wolf. And so is this Serena Butler . . . in her own way.\"\n>\n> The visitor bowed, swelling with pride. \"I am happy to assist you in\n> any manner, Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \"I trust you enjoyed the coach ride? I breed the stallions and keep\n> them groomed for important occasions. You gave me an excuse to use\n> them.\"\n>\n> \"It was an unusual experience,\" Vor admitted. \"A most . . . archaic\n> mode of transportation.\"\n>\n> \"Come stand here in the rain with me.\" Erasmus beckoned with a\n> synthetic hand. \"It is pleasant, I assure you.\"\n>\n> Vor stepped forward as he was told, trying not to show discomfort. The\n> rain quickly soaked his tunic, moistened his bare arms; water trickled\n> from his\n>\n> clumped dark hair, down his forehead and into his eyes. \"Yes, Erasmus.\n> It's . . . pleasant.\"\n>\n> The robot simulated a laugh. \"You are lying.\"\n>\n> With good humor, Vor said, \"It is what humans do best.\"\n>\n> Mercifully, the robot led them out of the rain. \"Let us discuss\n> Serena. She is attractive, according to human standards of beauty, is\n> she not?\" Vor didn't know what to say, but Erasmus pressed him, \"I\n> watched you with her. You would like to procreate with that feral\n> human, would you not? She is currently carrying the child of a\n> *hrethgir* lover, but we will have plenty of time. She is unlike any\n> simple pleasure slave you have been assigned?\"\n>\n> Vor pondered the questions, wondering what the robot really wanted to\n> know. \"Well, she is beautiful . . . and enticing.\"\n>\n> Erasmus made an artificial sound, something like a sigh. \"Sadly,\n> despite my numerous sensitive upgrades, I remain unable to experience\n> sexual activity, at least not in the way a biological male does. I\n> have spent centuries designing upgrades and modifications that might\n> replicate the sensations of ecstasy that even the lowliest human can\n> enjoy. Thus far, there has been little progress. My attempts with\n> female slaves have been alarmingly unsuccessful.\"\n>\n> Strolling along in his fine clothes, Erasmus gestured for Vor to\n> follow him through the greenhouse. As they walked down garden paths,\n> the regal machine identified various plants by name and origin, as if\n> he were lecturing a child or bragging about his knowledge. \"Serena\n> knows a great deal about plants herself. She was something of a\n> horticulturist on Salusa Secundus.\"\n>\n> Vor made polite responses, trying to guess how he could help the\n> robot. He wiped water from his eyes; his damp clothes felt clammy and\n> unpleasant.\n>\n> Finally Erasmus explained why he had summoned the young trustee.\n> \"Vorian Atreides, your father recently gave you a biological\n> life-extension\n>\n> treatment.\" The mechanical face shifted back to a smooth mirror, so as\n> not to give Vor a clue about what he wanted. \"Tell me, how do you\n> *feel* now that you have had centuries added to your lifespan? Surely,\n> it is a great gift from Agamemnon, as significant as his original\n> sperm donation.\"\n>\n> Before Vor could consider the question, Serena entered the greenhouse\n> carrying a silver tea set. She placed the tray with a rough clatter on\n> a polished stone table and poured dark liquid into two cups. She\n> handed one to Vor and one to the robot. Erasmus extruded a fibrous,\n> feathery-tipped probe into the tea, as if tasting it. His mirrored\n> mask shifted into an expression of supreme pleasure. \"Excellent,\n> Serena. A remarkable and interesting flavor!\"\n>\n> Vor did not care for the taste himself; the tea reminded him of bitter\n> chocolate mixed with spoiled fruit juices. Serena seemed amused at his\n> expression.\n>\n> \"It is good?\" Erasmus asked. \"Serena prepared it especially for you. I\n> let her choose an appropriate recipe.\"\n>\n> \"The flavor is . . . unique.\"\n>\n> The robot laughed. \"You are lying again.\"\n>\n> \"No, Erasmus. I am avoiding a direct response.\"\n>\n> Vor saw hostility in Serena's unusual eyes as she looked at him, and\n> he wondered if she had ruined the tea on purpose. Leaving the tray on\n> the stone table, she departed, saying, \"Maybe I should attend a\n> trustee school to learn how to be a better simpering servant.\"\n>\n> Vor watched Serena, surprised that Erasmus ignored her rudeness. \"It\n> amuses me to watch her attempts at resistance, Vorian. Harmless\n> defiance. She knows she can never escape.\" During a moment of silence,\n> the robot continued to study him. \"You did not answer my question\n> about the life extension.\"\n>\n> Now that he'd had time to ponder, Vor said, \"Honestly, I'm not sure\n> how I feel about it. My human body is fragile, easily damaged. Though\n> I am still prone to accidents or sickness, at least I will not grow\n> old and weak.\" Vor thought about all the years remaining to him, like\n> credits to spend. He would live several human lifespans, but becoming\n> a cymek would be so much more important. \"Even so, my extra years are\n> only the blink of an eye compared to the life of a thinking machine\n> such as yourself.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, the blink of an eye, an involuntary human reflex I can\n> understand physically and conceptually. You use it as an inexact\n> metaphor to indicate a brief period of time.\"\n>\n> Noticing watcheye screens on the greenhouse walls, Vor realized that\n> the evermind must be eavesdropping. \"Are you always this curious?\"\n>\n> \"Curiosity is how one learns,\" Erasmus said. \"I inquire because I am\n> inquisitive. That makes sense, does it not? Enlighten me. I would like\n> to speak with you again. You--- and Serena--- can give me an\n> interesting perspective.\"\n>\n> Vor bowed. \"As you wish, Erasmus. However, I must coordinate such\n> visits with my important work for Omnius. Soon the *Dream Voyager*\n> will be repaired and ready to depart on another update run.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, we all work for Omnius.\" Erasmus paused. Overhead, through the\n> murky ceiling of the greenhouse, the rain had stopped, leaving patchy\n> openings of blue sky. \"Think more about mortality and longevity. Come\n> and speak to me again before departing on your next voyage.\"\n>\n> \"I will seek permission to do so, Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> INTRIGUED BY THE fascinating interplay between the two humans, Erasmus\n> summoned Serena again and commanded her to escort their guest back to\n> his coach. She had been outwardly hostile to this son of Agamemnon,\n> while he was clearly interested in her . . . physically? . . .\n>\n> mentally? And how could one tell the difference? Another experiment,\n> perhaps?\n>\n> Even though they had exchanged few words, Vorian found his imagination\n> filled with this young woman. He had never met a female like her, with\n> such self-confident beauty, intelligence, and willingness to speak her\n> mind. Obviously Serena Butler had been raised to value herself as an\n> individual--- much as Erasmus worked hard to perfect his own\n> independence.\n>\n> Reaching the outer doorway of the villa, the young man blurted, \"When\n> is your baby due?\" At the coach, the horses seemed anxious to be off.\n> The uniformed robot driver sat like a statue.\n>\n> Serena's eyes widened with annoyance. She was about to retort that it\n> was none of his business, but she stopped short. Perhaps Vorian\n> Atreides was just the opportunity she had been hoping for. He had\n> information that might help her escape, and he had the trust of the\n> machines. It would be foolish to alienate him from the outset. If she\n> befriended him instead, might she not be able to show him what a free\n> human being could be?\n>\n> She drew a deep breath and smiled uncertainly. \"I'm not prepared to\n> discuss my baby with a complete stranger. But maybe next time you\n> come, we could talk. That might be a place to start.\" There. She had\n> done it.\n>\n> With that, she went inside the villa and carefully shut the door\n> behind her.\n>\n> As she watched the coach from the portico of the towering villa,\n> Serena Butler felt uncertain and confused about this deluded man who\n> so proudly served the machines. She didn't like him, wasn't sure she\n> could ever trust him. But perhaps he could be helpful.\n>\n> Feeling uneasy, and damp from the rain and mist in the outside air,\n> she hurried back inside to dry herself and change her clothes. With\n> the precious baby growing inside her womb, six months along now, she\n> thought of her beloved Xavier. Could Vorian help her return to him, or\n> would her child grow up in captivity, never to know its father?\n\n> *Of all the subjects of human behavior, two are most storied: warfare\n> and love.*\n>\n> --- COGITOR EKLO,\n>\n> *Ruminations on Things Lost*\n>\n> **T**he tragic loss of Serena had left Xavier off course, struggling\n> to regain the momentum of his life. Three months earlier, he had seen\n> the wreckage of her blockade runner floating in the seas of Giedi\n> Prime, and had read the indisputable DNA analysis of the blood samples\n> found inside.\n>\n> He did not claim to understand his feelings, and avoided them by\n> letting his work consume him. At first he had wanted to fling himself\n> recklessly at another machine stronghold, but Serena would have\n> scolded him for that. The thought of her disapproval was the only\n> thing that had stopped him.\n>\n> She had died fighting the inhuman enemy. Xavier needed an anchor to\n> grasp, some form of stability before moving on. For the sake of her\n> memory, the struggle must continue until every thinking machine had\n> been destroyed.\n>\n> Xavier's mind drifted to Octa, the haunting reminder of her sister.\n> Lovely in her own right, she was sensitive and introspective, rather\n> than the goal-driven crusader Serena had been. Still, in subtle ways,\n> the willowy girl reminded him achingly of Serena, in the shape of her\n> mouth and the gentle smile. It was like the echo of a pleasant memory.\n> Xavier found himself torn between staring longingly at Octa and\n> avoiding her entirely.\n>\n> She was there to comfort him when he grieved, gave him space when he\n> needed it, and cheered him when he wanted that. Quietly and gently,\n> Octa was filling a void in his life. Although their relationship\n> remained tranquil and unremarkable, she showed him attentive love.\n> Where Serena had been a storm of emotions, her sister was steady and\n> predictable.\n>\n> One day, on an impulse driven more by grief and longing than common\n> sense, Xavier asked Octa to become his wife. She had looked at him\n> with wide eyes, astonished. \"I am afraid to move, Xavier, to utter a\n> sound, because I must be dreaming.\"\n>\n> He had worn his clean and pressed Armada uniform bearing his new rank\n> insignia as Segundo. Xavier stood straight, his hands clasped, as if\n> addressing a superior officer, rather than asking Octa to join him as\n> his life mate. He had always known that Serena's sister had a girlish,\n> unrealistic infatuation with him, and now he hoped it could grow into\n> genuine love.\n>\n> \"In choosing you to marry me, dear Octa, I can think of no braver way\n> to march forward into the future. It is our best chance to honor\n> Serena's memory.\"\n>\n> The words sounded like a formal speech, but Octa flushed as if they\n> were a magical incantation. Aware that this was the wrong reason to\n> betroth himself to her, Xavier tried to dispel the uneasiness. He had\n> made up his mind and hoped that they could soothe each others' wounds.\n>\n> Both Manion and Livia Butler accepted and encouraged the shifting of\n> Xavier's affections; they even rushed the nuptials. Now the bridge\n> across an emotional chasm had been severed, and they believed the\n> match with Octa would benefit all of them.\n>\n> On the day of his wedding, Xavier searched for an inner peace, doing\n> his best to lock away the portion of his heart that would always\n> belong to Serena. He still longed for the peal of her laugh, for her\n> outspokenness, for the electric touch of her skin. Taking a few\n> private moments, he reviewed his favorite memories of her one by one\n> in his mind, and then, tearfully, set them aside.\n>\n> From now on, gentle Octa would be his wife. He would not hurt the\n> already-fragile girl by wallowing in regrets, or by comparing her to\n> her sister. That would be dishonest and unfair to her.\n>\n> A number of League representatives had gathered at the hilltop Butler\n> estate, where seven months earlier Xavier and Serena had participated\n> in the raucous bristleback hunt. Nearby, in the courtyard, they had\n> held the gala betrothal celebration filled with music and dancing---\n> but ending with the terrible news of Giedi Prime's fall.\n>\n> At Xavier's insistence, the wedding took place inside a new pavilion\n> with vistas of vineyards and olive groves. The fabric structure was so\n> resplendent and intricate in its workmanship that it cost more than a\n> modest house. Out in front, three large banners fluttered in a gentle\n> breeze, designating the households of Butler and Harkonnen, and of\n> Tantor, Xavier's adoptive family. In the valley below, the white\n> buildings of Zimia shone in sunlight, with wide avenues and large\n> administration complexes refurbished in the fourteen months since the\n> cymek attack.\n>\n> The ceremony was small and somber, despite the guests' pretenses and\n> Manion Butler's insistent merriment. New memories would supplant the\n> old ones. Smiling as he had not done in months, the Viceroy strutted\n> from guest to guest under the colorful awnings, tasting punch recipes\n> and sampling the cornucopia of cheeses and wines.\n>\n> The silent bride and groom stood by a small altar at the front of the\n> crowded tent, holding hands. Dressed in the pale-blue gown of\n> traditional Salusan weddings, Octa looked ethereal, lovely and fragile\n> beside him. Her strawberry-blond hair was held neatly in place with\n> pearl-head pins.\n>\n> Some would say this rushed marriage to Serena's sister was a reaction\n> to Xavier's grief, but he knew he was taking the honorable course. He\n> reminded himself a thousand times that Serena would have approved.\n> Together, he and Octa would bring closure to so much pain and sadness.\n>\n> Inside the flower-decked pavilion stood Abbess Livia Butler, her\n> amber-brown hair highlighted by sparkling golden strands. She had come\n> from the City of Introspection to perform the ceremony. Confident and\n> proud, as if she had purged all doubts and sorrow from her mind, Livia\n> looked at the bride and groom, then smiled at her husband. Manion\n> Butler barely fit into\n>\n> his red and gold tuxedo. Soft flesh poked out at the neck and at the\n> ends of the sleeves.\n>\n> A group of players began to strum their balisets. A boy with a sweet\n> tenor voice sang slowly. Beside Xavier, Octa seemed to be in her own\n> dreamy world, not quite certain how to react to the turn of\n> circumstances. She squeezed his hand, and he raised it to his lips and\n> kissed it.\n>\n> Ever since the death of her twin brother Fredo, Octa had developed an\n> ability to shut things out, never overwhelming herself with\n> large-scale concerns but instead preferring smaller tableaux. Such a\n> limited focus might permit her to be happy, and Xavier, too.\n>\n> Tears glistening in his expressive eyes, Viceroy Butler stepped\n> forward to clasp their hands. After a long moment he turned solemnly\n> to his wife, and nodded. Abbess Livia began to intone the ceremony.\n> \"We are here to sing a song of love, a song that has joined men and\n> women since the earliest days of civilization.\"\n>\n> As Octa smiled up at Xavier, he could almost imagine she was Serena,\n> but he drove the troubling image away. He and Octa loved each other in\n> a different way. Their bond grew stronger each time he held her in his\n> arms. Xavier had only to accept the warmth that she readily bestowed\n> on him.\n>\n> Before them, Livia spoke the traditional words, the roots of which\n> extended back to the Panchristian and Buddislamic texts of ancient\n> times. The lilting phrases were beautiful, and Xavier's mind kept\n> expanding outward, thinking forward and backward. The words were\n> infinitely calm and reassuring as Abbess Livia guided the young couple\n> through their vows.\n>\n> Soon everything necessary had been said. As he shared the ritual of\n> love and placed a ring on Octa's finger, Xavier Harkonnen pledged his\n> eternal devotion to her. Not even the thinking machines could tear\n> this relationship apart.\n>\n> *Talk is based on the assumption that you can get somewhere if you\n> keep puttingone word after another.*\n\n--- IBLIS GINJO,\n\nnotes in the margin of a stolen notebook\n\n> **A**jax strode his intimidating walker-form into the Forum Plaza,\n> inspecting every operation, searching for flaws. With his array of\n> optic threads, the Titan scanned the polished colossus that showed his\n> long-forgotten human form. Ajax was frustrated that Iblis Ginjo had\n> maintained such a careful watch that he could find no excuse to impose\n> amusing punishments. . . .\n>\n> In turmoil, Iblis watched for an opportunity of his own. His\n> imagination kept returning to the remarkable things he had learned\n> from the Cogitor Eklo, especially details of the glorious failure of\n> the Hrethgir Rebellions. Ajax personified the brutality and pain of\n> those long-ago battles.\n>\n> Could the Cogitor help Iblis to spread the quiet fires of a brewing\n> revolution? They could learn from the mistakes of the past attempts.\n> Had there ever been a rebel of trustee stature, like Iblis? And how\n> could the secondary Aquim assist him?\n>\n> Despite his subtle investigations, his ability to manipulate\n> conversations and make others unwittingly divulge their secrets, Iblis\n> had not yet found evidence of other resistance groups. Perhaps their\n> leadership was scattered, disorganized, weak. Who had sent him the\n> secret messages--- five in the past three months?\n>\n> The lack of evidence frustrated Iblis, because he wanted to push the\n> uprising forward, now that he had made up his mind. On the other hand,\n> if the dissenters were too easily found, they would have no chance\n> against the organized thinking machines.\n>\n> After pushing his slaves particularly hard and finishing his assigned\n> labors, Iblis asked to take another pilgrimage to Eklo's stone tower.\n> Only the\n>\n> Cogitor could give him the answers he needed. When he spoke with the\n> administrative cymek Dante, showing records that demonstrated his\n> productivity and efficiency, the Titan bureaucrat granted him\n> permission to leave the city grid. Dante made it clear, however, that\n> he didn't understand why a mere work supervisor would be interested in\n> nonproductive philosophical issues. It seemed to go beyond the\n> interests of most trustees. \"It will not benefit you.\"\n>\n> \"I'm sure you are right, Lord Dante . . . but it amuses me.\"\n>\n> Setting out before dawn, Iblis urged the smelly burrhorse into the\n> rocky desert and up the slopes to the monastery. Aquim awaited him at\n> the steep circular stairs to the tower, again looking disheveled and\n> somewhat dazed from semuta. From the first time Iblis had immersed his\n> hand in electrafluid and touched the Cogitor's thoughts, he could not\n> imagine why Aquim wanted to dull his perceptions. Perhaps the complex\n> enlightened thoughts of Eklo were so vast and overwhelming that the\n> big-shouldered secondary needed to dampen the flood of confusing\n> revelations.\n>\n> \"I see you look at me with disapproval,\" Aquim said, peering out\n> through slitted eyelids.\n>\n> \"Oh no,\" Iblis said. Then, realizing he could not get away with lying,\n> he said, \"I was just noticing that you enjoy your semuta.\"\n>\n> The big man smiled and spoke in a voice that slurred slightly. \"To an\n> outsider, it may appear that I have deadened my senses, but semuta\n> permits me to forget my own destructive past, before I was inspired to\n> join Cogitor Eklo. It also enables me to focus on what is really\n> important, ignoring the sensual distractions of the flesh.\"\n>\n> \"I can't picture you as a destructive man.\"\n>\n> \"Oh, but I was. My father fought against enslavement and died in the\n> attempt. Afterward, I sought revenge against the machines, and I was\n> good at it. I led a small band of men, and we . . . damaged some\n> robots. I am sorry to say that we also killed a number of trustee\n> slaves who got in our\n>\n> way, men such as yourself. Then Eklo arranged for my rescue, and for\n> my rehabilitation of sorts. He never told me why he sought me out, or\n> how he made the arrangements. There are many things the Cogitor does\n> not reveal to anyone, not even to me.\"\n>\n> Abruptly, the monk turned and plodded unsteadily up the stairs,\n> leading Iblis to the chamber where the Cogitor lived in a state of\n> eternal contemplation. Standing in the tower room with the\n> color-bathed observation windows, Aquim said, \"Eklo has considered\n> your situation at length. Long ago he watched the changes in humanity\n> after the Titans crushed the Old Empire, but he did nothing. Eklo\n> thought the challenge and adversity would improve the human race by\n> strengthening their minds, forcing them out of their sleepwalking\n> existence.\"\n>\n> The monk wiped a stain from the corner of his mouth. \"By separating\n> their minds from their bodies, the cymek Titans could have become\n> enlightened, like Cogitors. That was Eklo's hope when he assisted\n> Juno. But the Titans never rose above their animal flaws. This\n> weakness enabled Omnius to conquer them, and humanity.\" Aquim stepped\n> toward the translucent brain canister resting on a window shelf. \"Eklo\n> believes you may be able to institute a change.\"\n>\n> Iblis's heart leaped. \"Nothing is impossible.\" But he knew he could\n> not fight the machines by himself, would need to find others to help\n> him. *Many others.*\n>\n> Before the transparent window, Eklo's plexiplaz container glistened in\n> a wash of golden morning sunlight. In the distance, Iblis could see\n> the unending skyline of megaliths and monuments designed by the cymeks\n> and built with human sweat and blood. *Do I really want to see them\n> all crumble to dust?*\n>\n> The crew boss hesitated as he considered the consequences, remembering\n> the billions of victims of the Hrethgir Rebellions on Walgis and other\n> worlds. Then he sensed an intrusion into his thoughts, something\n> bumping against them.\n>\n> Aquim removed the covering of the Cogitor's canister, exposing the\n> nutrient fluid that supported the ancient mind. \"Come, Eklo wishes to\n> make direct contact with you.\"\n>\n> The tank's nutrient solution was like amniotic fluid, tingling with\n> immeasurable mental energy. Tentative, fighting his eagerness to know\n> and learn, Iblis dipped his fingers into the electrafluid, touching\n> the slippery surface of Eklo's brain and unlocking all the thoughts\n> the Cogitor wanted to give him.\n>\n> Aquim stood to one side with a strange expression on his face, part\n> beatific complacence, part envy.\n>\n> \"Neutrality is a delicate balancing act,\" Eklo said directly into\n> Iblis's mind, through the neurelectric contact promulgated by the\n> organic circuitry. \"Long ago, I answered Juno's many questions about\n> how to overthrow the Old Empire. My unbiased answers and advice\n> allowed the Titans to formulate successful plans, and the course of\n> the human race was forever changed. For many centuries I reconsidered\n> what I did.\" The brain seemed to press against Iblis's fingertips. \"It\n> is essential for all Cogitors to maintain absolute neutrality. We must\n> be objective.\"\n>\n> Puzzled, Iblis said, \"Then why are you speaking to me? Why have you\n> raised the possibility that the machines might be overthrown?\"\n>\n> \"In order to reestablish the balance of neutrality,\" Eklo said. \"Once,\n> I inadvertently assisted the Titans, so I must now answer your\n> questions with the same objectivity. In the final analysis, I will\n> have maintained equilibrium.\"\n>\n> Iblis swallowed hard. \"Then you have foreseen where it all ends?\"\n>\n> \"There are endings all around us, and beginnings. You alone can decide\n> where you are on the path.\"\n>\n> As Iblis's thoughts spun, searching for useful questions about machine\n> weaknesses and vulnerabilities, Eklo intruded, \"I cannot provide\n> concrete\n>\n> military or political details, but if you phrase your questions\n> cleverly enough, as Juno did, then you shall have what you need. The\n> art of cleverness is a prime lesson of life. You must outwit the\n> machines, Iblis Ginjo.\"\n>\n> For more than an hour, Eklo guided Iblis. \"I have considered this\n> problem for many centuries, long before you came to me. And if you do\n> not succeed, I shall consider it even longer.\"\n>\n> \"But I can't fail. I must succeed.\"\n>\n> \"It will take more than desire on your part. You must tap into the\n> deepest emotions of the masses.\" Eklo fell silent for several moments.\n>\n> Iblis struggled to comprehend, trying to stretch his thoughts. \"Love,\n> hate, fear? Is that what you mean?\"\n>\n> \"They are components, yes.\"\n>\n> \"Components?\"\n>\n> \"Of religion. The machines are very powerful, and it will take more\n> than a mere political or social uprising to defeat them. The people\n> must coalesce around a powerful idea that goes even deeper, into the\n> very essence of their existence, what it means to be human. You must\n> be more than a trustee, but a visionary leader. Slaves need to rise up\n> in a great holy war against the machines, an unstoppable jihad to\n> overthrow their masters.\"\n>\n> \"A holy war? A jihad? But how can I do that?\"\n>\n> \"I tell you only what I sense, Iblis Ginjo, what I have thought and\n> envisioned. You must go out and discover the rest of the answers for\n> yourself. But know this: Of all human wars in history, a jihad is the\n> most passionate, conquering worlds and civilizations, mowing down\n> everything in its path.\"\n>\n> \"And the people sending me messages--- how do they fit into this?\"\n>\n> \"I know nothing of them,\" Eklo said, \"and I do not see them in any of\n> my visions. Perhaps you have been specially chosen, or it might be\n> nothing but a ruse or a trap by the machines.\" The Cogitor fell\n> silent, then said, \"Now I must ask you to leave, for my mind is tired\n> and I need to rest.\"\n>\n> When Iblis departed from the imposing stone tower, he felt a strange\n> mixture of exhilaration and confusion. He needed to organize the\n> information into a comprehensive plan. Though he was not a holy man or\n> a military person, he did understand how to manipulate groups of\n> people, how to channel their loyalties in order to achieve his goals.\n> Already, his work crews would do almost anything for him. His\n> leadership abilities would be his greatest asset, and weapon. But the\n> scale was not large enough. It needed to be much larger than a few\n> hundred people in order to succeed.\n>\n> And he needed to be very careful, in case the thinking machines were\n> trying to trap him.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WITH ACCESS TO Omnius's watcheyes and distributed surveillance\n> hardware, Erasmus monitored the activities of his experimental\n> subjects. Many loyal trustees had ignored the hints he had sent to\n> them; others had been too frightened to act. But some had shown an\n> amusing amount of initiative.\n>\n> Yes, Erasmus felt that Iblis Ginjo was a perfect candidate to prove\n> his point, and win the bet with Omnius.\n>\n> *\"Systematic\" is a dangerous word, a dangerous concept. Systems\n> originate with their human creators. Systems take over.*\n\n--- TIO HOLTZMAN,\n\nacceptance speech for Poritrin Medal of Glory\n\n> **A**s he sat in the crowded room of equation solvers, Ishmael\n> scrutinized the furnishings of Savant Holtzman's estate, smelled\n> polishing oils, flower bouquets, perfumed candles. This place was\n> clean, comfortable, and warm . . . far more pleasant than the slave\n> barracks on the muddy river delta.\n>\n> The boy should have counted his blessings.\n>\n> But this unwelcome place was not Harmonthep. He missed his small boat,\n> navigating through rivulets in the tall reeds. He especially missed\n> the evenings, when the Zensunni would gather in the central hut on the\n> highest stilts to tell stories, recite fire poetry, or simply listen\n> to his grandfather read comforting sutras.\n>\n> \"I hate this place,\" Aliid said beside him, speaking loudly enough\n> that he drew a scolding glare from Tio Holtzman himself.\n>\n> \"Perhaps you would rather return to the mudflats or the agricultural\n> fields?\"\n>\n> Aliid frowned at his own outburst, but met the scientist's steady\n> gaze. \"I hated those places too,\" he mumbled, but not by way of\n> apology.\n>\n> All work stopped. All eyes were fixed on him.\n>\n> Holtzman shook his head in disbelief. \"I simply do not understand why\n> you people complain about everything. I feed and clothe you, I give\n> you easy assignments that advance the cause of humanity--- and still\n> you want to crawl back to squalid villages and live in disease and\n> filth.\"\n>\n> The inventor looked genuinely angry. \"Don't you understand that\n> thinking machines are out there trying to crush every living person?\n> Just imagine all the humans they slaughtered on Giedi Prime, and no\n> one could stop them! Omnius doesn't care about your religion or your\n> foolish politics against civilization. If they find your little\n> hovels, they will destroy them, burn them to the ground.\"\n>\n> *Just like the Tlulaxa slavers did to my village*, Ishmael thought. He\n> saw Aliid's dark eyes flash and knew that his friend was thinking the\n> same thing.\n>\n> Holtzman shook his head. \"You fanatics have no sense of\n> responsibility. Luckily, it is my job to force it on you.\" He went\n> back to his scribing board, angrily jabbed his fingers at the symbols.\n> \"Here are segments of equations. I need you to solve them. Simple\n> mathematics. *Try* to go through the steps I showed you.\" His gaze\n> narrowed. \"Each correct answer will earn one full share of daily\n> rations. If you make mistakes, you go hungry.\"\n>\n> With a heavy heart, Ishmael turned to the papers and computational\n> devices before him, doing his best to follow the supposedly simple\n> calculations.\n>\n> On Harmonthep, all the children in the marsh village had received a\n> basic education in mathematics, science, and engineering. The elders\n> felt that such knowledge would be important for them, when their\n> civilization rose again and the faithful constructed great cities like\n> those in Zensunni lore. Ishmael's grandfather, like many village\n> elders, also spent time instructing the young people in the sutras, in\n> logical and philosophical conundrums that only the tenets of Buddislam\n> could solve.\n>\n> On Aliid's home of IV Anbus, the closely orbiting moons changed the\n> seasons dramatically, causing the planet to oscillate. Thus, the boy\n> had been taught a different branch of mathematics and astronomy,\n> because the ever-varying calendar affected the floods that roared\n> through polished red rock gorges, where the Zenshiite cities had been\n> erected. Flood management workers required sophisticated calculations\n> to understand the variances. Aliid had learned the techniques in order\n> to help his own people. Here,\n>\n> though, he was forced to assist the overlords who had enslaved him,\n> and he resented it.\n>\n> Aliid's first assignment on Poritrin had been to work the cane\n> harvest. He had labored for weeks hacking at tall reeds, from which\n> sweet juices were turned into sugars or distilled into Poritrin rum.\n> The fibrous cane residue was used to make Poritrin cloth. He had\n> wielded a sharp scythe, chopping down woody stalks that splattered\n> sticky syrups. The stalks were harvested after heavy rains when they\n> were most laden with juices, and heaviest to carry.\n>\n> Toward the end of the cutting season, their master had delivered them\n> all to the slave markets in Starda, after accusing them of starting a\n> suspicious fire in the cane silos and destroying half a season's crop.\n> Aliid told Ishmael of this with a lilting smile, but never confessed\n> to having participated in any outright sabotage.\n>\n> Now, Ishmael bent over his calculations, checking and rechecking his\n> math by sliding bars and moving counters on the calculation device.\n> Already his stomach was growling, since Holtzman--- angry about the\n> many mistakes committed the previous day--- had vowed not to feed the\n> solvers until they proved they could do the work. Most of the slaves\n> grudgingly completed their assignments properly.\n>\n> Several days later, after the new solvers had adequately performed\n> their exercises, Holtzman gave them real work. At first, the inventor\n> let them believe it was merely another test. Ishmael could tell from\n> his expression and agitation, though, that he was counting on these\n> results rather than simply putting the crew through their paces.\n>\n> Aliid worked diligently, but Ishmael noted from his expression that he\n> had something devious in mind. Ishmael wasn't sure he wanted to know\n> what it was.\n>\n> After they had worked on numerical simulations for several more days,\n> Aliid finally leaned over to Ishmael. \"Now it is time to make a few\n> subtle changes,\" he said, grinning. \"Small enough that no one will\n> notice.\"\n>\n> \"We can't do that,\" Ishmael said. \"They'll catch us.\"\n>\n> The dark-haired boy gave an impatient frown. \"Holtzman has already\n> checked our work, so he's not going to redo all the math. Now that he\n> trusts us, he can focus on some other scheme. This is our only chance\n> to get even. Think of all we've suffered.\"\n>\n> Ishmael could not disagree, and after having heard Bel Moulay's talk\n> of bloody rebellion, this seemed like a better way to express their\n> displeasure.\n>\n> \"Look.\" Aliid pointed at the string of equations, and with his stylus\n> made a tiny mark, changing a minus sign to a plus sign, and then moved\n> a decimal point to a different part of the equation. \"Simple enough\n> mistakes, easily excused, but they will yield dramatically different\n> results.\"\n>\n> Ishmael was uneasy. \"I understand how it could harm Holtzman's\n> inventions, but I do not see how this will assist *us*. I'm more\n> concerned with seeing that we go back home.\"\n>\n> Aliid looked at him. \"Ishmael, you know the sutras as well as I,\n> perhaps better. Have you forgotten the one that says, 'When you help\n> your enemy, you harm all the faithful'?\"\n>\n> Ishmael had heard his grandfather utter the phrase, but never before\n> had it meant as much to him. \"All right. But nothing that can appear\n> deliberate.\"\n>\n> \"If I understand anything about this work,\" Aliid said, \"even a small\n> miscalculation will cause plenty of damage.\"\n>\n> *PSYCHOLOGY: The science of inventing words for things that do not\n> exist.*\n\n---ERASMUS,\n\n*Reflections on Sentient Biologicals*\n\n> **I**n the sunny botanical garden of the robot's grandiose villa,\n> Serena Butler snipped dead flowers and leaves, tending plants in their\n> beds and planters. Silently resistant, biding her time, Serena\n> performed her daily tasks like any other slave, but always Erasmus\n> watched her as if she were a pet. He was her captor and jailor.\n>\n> She wore black coveralls, her long, amber brown hair tied back in a\n> ponytail. The work allowed her to think of Xavier, of the promises\n> they had exchanged, of making love in the meadow after the bristleback\n> attack, and again in her plush bed on the night before she had slipped\n> off to Giedi Prime.\n>\n> Each morning Serena went to the robot's flower beds, glad for the\n> chance to think undisturbed about getting away from Earth. Day after\n> day, she kept her eyes open for some way to escape--- the obstacles\n> seemed insurmountable--- or a means to cause significant harm to the\n> thinking machines, despite the fact that sabotage would undoubtedly\n> cost her life, and her unborn baby's. Could she do that to Xavier?\n>\n> She couldn't imagine the grief he must be going through. Somehow she\n> would find a way back to him. She owed it to him, to herself, and to\n> their baby. She had hoped to have Xavier hold her hand as she\n> delivered their child. He should have been her husband by now, their\n> lives intertwined in a union stronger than the sum of their\n> individualities, a bastion to stand against the thinking machines.\n>\n> He didn't even know she was still alive.\n>\n> She stroked her curved belly. Serena felt the child growing within her\n> and was filled with foreboding. Two more months and the baby was\n> due--- what did Erasmus mean to do, once the child was born? She had\n> seen the locked doors to the ominous laboratories, had looked with\n> revulsion and horror at the filthy slave pens.\n>\n> And yet, the robot kept her busy with flowers.\n>\n> Erasmus often stood motionless beside her as she worked, his oval face\n> unreadable as he challenged her to debates. \"Understanding starts at\n> the beginning,\" he had said. \"I must build a foundation before I can\n> comprehend everything.\"\n>\n> \"But how will you use that knowledge?\" She yanked out a weed. \"Will\n> you think of more extravagant ways to inflict misery and pain?\"\n>\n> The robot paused, his burnished face a mirror that reflected a\n> distorted image of her own face. \"That is . . . not my objective.\"\n>\n> \"Then why do you keep so many slaves in such terrible conditions? If\n> you don't intend to cause misery, why not give them a clean place to\n> live? Why not provide them with better food, education, and care?\"\n>\n> \"It is not necessary.\"\n>\n> \"Maybe not to you,\" she said, surprised at her boldness. \"But they\n> would be happier and able to do better work.\"\n>\n> Serena had watched how Erasmus lived in magnificent luxury--- an\n> affectation, since no robot could require such things--- yet the\n> household slaves, especially those in the horrible communal pens,\n> existed in filth and fear. Whether or not she remained a captive here,\n> she might be able to improve their lot. If nothing else, she would\n> consider it a victory against the machines.\n>\n> She continued, \"It would take a truly . . . sophisticated thinking\n> machine to understand that improving the slaves' quality of life would\n> improve their\n>\n> productivity, and thus benefit their master as well. The slaves could\n> clean and maintain their own pens if they had the most minor\n> supplies.\"\n>\n> \"I will consider it. Provide me with a detailed list.\"\n>\n> Then, after giving him her suggestions, Serena had not seen the robot\n> for two days. Machine sentinels tended the workers in the villa, while\n> Erasmus himself vanished into his laboratories.\n>\n> She could hear nothing through the soundproofed barriers, though the\n> foul odors and disappearing people left her wondering. Finally,\n> another slave told her, \"You don't want to know what goes on in there.\n> Just be thankful you aren't required to clean up afterward.\"\n>\n> Now, Serena worked her hands in the loamy earth while listening to the\n> soothing classical music that Erasmus constantly played. Her back\n> ached and her joints swelled from the advancing pregnancy, but she did\n> not slacken her efforts.\n>\n> Erasmus approached so silently that she did not notice him until she\n> looked up from her plants to see his mirror-smooth face nested in a\n> frilly antique collar. She stood quickly to hide her startled reaction\n> and wiped her hands on her coveralls. \"Do you learn more by spying on\n> me?\"\n>\n> \"I can spy on you anytime I like. I learn a great deal from the\n> questions I ask.\" His shifting metallic-polymer film changed his face\n> into a frozen expression of dancing mirth. \"Now, I would like you to\n> select the flower you consider the most beautiful of all. I am curious\n> to see your response.\"\n>\n> Erasmus had played such games before. He seemed unable to understand\n> subjective decisions, wishing to quantify matters of opinion and\n> personal taste. \"Each plant is beautiful in its own way,\" she said.\n>\n> \"Nevertheless, choose one. Then explain your choice to me.\"\n>\n> She wandered down the dirt paths, looking from side to side. Erasmus\n> followed her, recording every time she hesitated at a blossom.\n>\n> \"There are observable characteristics, such as color, shape, and\n> delicacy,\" the robot said, \"and more esoteric variables such as the\n> perfume scent.\"\n>\n> \"Don't overlook the emotional component.\" Wistfulness tinged her\n> voice. \"Some of these plants remind me of my home on Salusa Secundus.\n> Certain flowers might have a greater sentimental value for me, though\n> not necessarily for anyone else. Maybe I remember a time when the man\n> I love gave me a bouquet. You wouldn't understand such associations,\n> however.\"\n>\n> \"You are stalling. Make your selection.\"\n>\n> She pointed to an immense elephant flower with bright streaks of\n> shimmering orange and red, highlighted by a horn-shaped stigma at the\n> center. \"Right now, this one is the most beautiful.\"\n>\n> \"Why?\"\n>\n> \"My mother used to grow these at our home. As a child, I never thought\n> them particularly pretty, but now they are a reminder of the happier\n> days--- before I met *you*.\" She immediately regretted her honesty,\n> because it revealed too much about her private thoughts.\n>\n> \"Very good, very good.\" The cognizant machine ignored her insult and\n> stared at the elephant flower, as if analyzing all aspects with his\n> full set of sensor capabilities. Like a wine connoisseur, he tried to\n> describe the merits of its scent, but to Serena his analysis sounded\n> clinical, lacking the subtleties and emotional layering that had\n> prompted her own selection.\n>\n> Strangest of all, Erasmus seemed aware of his own failing. \"I know\n> that humans are in some ways more sensitive than machines---*for now*.\n> However, machines have more potential to become superior in every\n> area. This is why I wish to understand all aspects of sentient\n> biological life.\"\n>\n> With an involuntary shudder, Serena thought of his sealed\n> laboratories, and knew from every indication that his secret\n> activities went far beyond the study of beautiful flowers.\n>\n> Erasmus assumed she was interested in his observations. \"If properly\n> developed, a thinking machine could be more perfect intellectually,\n> creatively, and spiritually than a human could ever hope to be, with\n> unparalleled mental freedom and range. I am inspired by the marvels we\n> could accomplish, if only Omnius did not exert such pressure on other\n> machines to conform.\"\n>\n> Serena listened, hoping he would let more information slip. Did she\n> sense a potential conflict between Erasmus and the computer evermind?\n>\n> The robot continued, \"Capacity for information is the key. Machines\n> will absorb not only more raw data, but more *feelings*, as soon as we\n> understand them. When that happens we will be able to love and hate\n> far more passionately than humans. Our music will be greater, our\n> paintings more magnificent. Once we achieve complete self-awareness,\n> thinking machines will create the greatest renaissance in history.\"\n>\n> Serena frowned at his assertions. \"You can keep improving yourself,\n> Erasmus, but we human beings use only small portions of our brains. We\n> have an enormous potential to develop new abilities. Your capacity for\n> learning is no greater than ours.\"\n>\n> The robot froze in place, as if startled. \"Quite right. How could I\n> have missed that important detail?\" His face shifted, becoming passive\n> and contemplative, then metamorphosed into a broad smile. \"The road to\n> improvement will be a long one. This will require more investigation.\"\n>\n> Abruptly he changed the subject, as if to emphasize her vulnerability.\n> \"What about your baby? Tell me the emotions you feel toward its father\n> and describe the physical act of copulation.\"\n>\n> Trying to stop the flood of painful recollections, Serena remained\n> silent. Erasmus found her reluctance fascinating. \"And are you\n> physically attracted to Vorian Atreides? I have run tests on the\n> handsome young man--- he is fine breeding stock. After your pregnancy\n> is finished, would you like to mate with him?\"\n>\n> Serena took an agitated breath, fixing her mind on memories of Xavier.\n> \"*Mate*? Regardless of how much you study us, there are many things\n> your machine brain will never understand about human nature.\"\n>\n> \"We shall see about that,\" he said, calmly.\n>\n> *Consciousness and logic are not reliable standards.*\n\n--- COGITORS,\n\n*Fundamental Postulate*\n\n> **A**linked cluster of robot drones scuttled over the *Dream\n> Voyager*'s hull as the craft sat in a drydock structure that spanned\n> an artificial crater on the spaceport grounds. Tiny machines crawled\n> into exhaust ports and scoured the reactor chambers, a coordinated\n> army of maintenance units repairing the damage inflicted by the League\n> Armada.\n>\n> Vor and Seurat stood on a platform looking at the drones, confident\n> that the repairs would be completed according to programmed\n> specifications. \"Soon, we will be able to depart,\" the robot captain\n> said. \"You must be anxious for me to defeat you again in our war\n> games.\"\n>\n> \"And you must be anxious to tell more jokes that I will not find\n> amusing,\" Vor countered.\n>\n> He did feel restless to be back aboard the *Dream Voyager*, but Vor\n> also had a different sort of impatience, an ache in his chest that\n> grew worse every time he thought of Erasmus's beautiful house slave.\n> Despite Serena Butler's complete dismissal of him, he could not stop\n> thinking about her.\n>\n> Worst of all, he did not understand why. Because of his paternal ties,\n> Vor Atreides had enjoyed numerous pleasure slaves, some as lovely as\n> this one. They had been bred and trained for their duties, and lived\n> in captivity among the thinking machines. But the female house slave\n> of Erasmus, despite having been brought to the robot's villa against\n> her will, gave no impression that she was defeated.\n>\n> Vor could see her face, the fullness of her lips, the penetrating gaze\n> of her lavender eyes as she looked at him with displeasure. Even\n> though her pregnancy showed, he was still drawn to her, and felt a\n> strange simmering jealousy. Where was her lover? Who was he?\n>\n> When Vor returned to Erasmus's villa, she would undoubtedly ignore or\n> insult him again. Nonetheless, he looked forward to seeing her before\n> he and Seurat departed on another long update run. He practiced what\n> he might say to her, but even in his imagination she could dance\n> circles around him with her wit.\n>\n> Vor climbed a ladder on the drydock framework and crawled into a\n> narrow interior wall space, where he watched a maintenance drone lay\n> down new webs of liquid circuitry for the main navigation panel. The\n> scarlet drone worked efficiently with its built-in tools. Vor inched\n> deeper into the confined area and peered at the open panel, noting the\n> dizzying pattern of colored components.\n>\n> \"You will be disappointed if you expect to catch it making a mistake,\"\n> Seurat said from behind him. \"Or are you attempting your frequently\n> threatened sabotage again?\"\n>\n> \"I am a dirty *hrethgir*. You can never tell what I might do, old\n> Metalmind.\"\n>\n> \"The fact that you do not laugh at my jokes indicates that you have\n> insufficient intelligence to institute such a devious plan, Vorian\n> Atreides.\"\n>\n> \"Maybe you're just not funny.\"\n>\n> Unfortunately, banter and repair activities did not distract Vor from\n> thoughts of Serena. He felt like a giddy boy, exhilarated and confused\n> at the same time. He wanted to talk to someone about his feelings, but\n> not his robot friend, who had even less understanding of women than\n> Vor did.\n>\n> Rather, he needed to talk with *Serena*. Perhaps with her insight and\n> intelligence, she had seen through him and didn't like what she saw.\n> She had called him \"a kept slave who cannot see his chains.\" A\n> baffling insult, considering all the privilege in his life. He had no\n> idea what she meant.\n>\n> The repair drone finished tracing the high-flux paths of an electronic\n> module, then switched tools to tune a data-collection port. The\n> machine's\n>\n> slender arm extruded farther out so it could interface with an\n> adjustment pad deep inside the panel.\n>\n> Standing inside the *Dream Voyager*'s cockpit, Seurat powered up the\n> ship's primary controls, using built-in diagnostics to verify the\n> navsystems. \"I have discovered an interesting shortcut to our second\n> stop on the update route. Unfortunately, it entails flying directly\n> through a blue-giant star.\"\n>\n> \"In that case, I'd advise a different route,\" Vor said.\n>\n> \"I concur, though I dislike wasting time.\"\n>\n> He wondered what would happen to Serena when the baby was born. Would\n> Erasmus assign it to the slave pens to keep it from interfering with\n> Serena's duties? For the first time in his life, Vor found himself\n> empathizing with a captive human.\n>\n> As a valued trustee, he had always considered himself part of the\n> Synchronized Worlds, and he looked forward to becoming a neo-cymek\n> someday. He believed that Omnius ruled humans for their own good;\n> otherwise, the galaxy would crumble into unguided chaos.\n>\n> He was accustomed to situations where one party was dominant and the\n> other submissive. For the first time he wondered if there could be\n> other types of relationships, on an equal, cooperative basis. The\n> robot captain of the *Dream Voyager* was clearly Vorian's master, but\n> they had a productive partnership.\n>\n> Vor wondered if he and Serena could go a step further and form a\n> relationship in which the two of them treated each other with complete\n> equality. It was a radical concept, one that jarred his sensibilities.\n> And yet, he didn't think she would accept anything less.\n>\n> Wedged into a narrow space behind the bulkhead and the navigation\n> panel, the maintenance drone made odd sounds, signaling to itself in\n> staticky gibberish, repeating test connections over and over.\n>\n> With a sigh, Vor said to the drone, \"Here, let me try that tool.\"\n>\n> The drone spun toward him and surrendered the diagnostic probe, but\n> part of its metal-film extensions crossed a connection in the exposed\n> circuit field, and a hot jolt of electricity struck like a hammer. It\n> squealed. The stench of melted circuits and fused hydraulics curled up\n> from the now-ruined system panel.\n>\n> Vorian scrambled out of the confined space, then wiped a hand across\n> his forehead. Seurat scanned the damaged drone and the blackened\n> components of the ship's navsystem. \"It is my expert assessment that\n> we need to perform a bit more maintenance here.\"\n>\n> When Vor laughed at the comment, Seurat was surprised. \"Why do you\n> find that funny?\"\n>\n> \"Never ask someone to explain humor, Seurat. Just accept the\n> laughter.\"\n>\n> After shutting down the power supply, Vor removed the blistered,\n> malfunctioning drone and dropped it with a clatter onto the deck.\n> These units were expendable. Seurat transmitted a request for a new\n> drone.\n>\n> While they waited for the repairs to continue, Vor shored up his\n> resolve.\n>\n> Collecting his questions, he mentioned the quandary of his feelings.\n>\n> Perhaps something in the robot's database would be useful.\n>\n> Embedded in his smooth face, the robot's optic threads twinkled like\n> tiny suns. \"I do not understand your problem,\" Seurat said while he\n> uploaded a diagnostic summary from one of the ship's databanks. \"You\n> have appropriate standing among the thinking machines. Submit a\n> request to Erasmus.\"\n>\n> Vor was exasperated. \"It's not like that, Seurat. Even if Erasmus\n> transfers Serena to me . . . what if she refuses me?\"\n>\n> \"Then widen your search. You make this unnecessarily difficult. Among\n> the human candidates on Earth, you will easily find a compatible\n> female, even\n>\n> one with features similar to this particular slave, if you value her\n> physical attributes so much.\"\n>\n> Vor wished he had never brought up the subject. \"Thinking machines can\n> be utterly stupid at times.\"\n>\n> \"You have never expressed such emotions to me before.\" \"That's because\n> I never felt this way before.\"\n>\n> Seurat froze in place. \"I am intellectually aware of the human\n> biological imperative to mate and reproduce.

The Zensunni\n> Wanderers had built their homes in those caves, keeping the entrances\n> secret from outside eyes. Selim knew the way.\n>\n> Beneath the young man's aching legs, the worm thrashed, reluctant to\n> go closer to the rocks.

He controlled it completely.\n>\n> Selim saw more figures on the rocks and heard faint shouts, people\n> summoning others. Soon, astonished Zensunni villagers stood all along\n> the ledges. He enjoyed seeing their wide eyes and open mouths.\n>\n> Selim drove the sandworm past them all, shouting into the wind and\n> waving insolently. Using his goads and his stick, he forced the demon\n> to turn about yet again, twisting its serpentine head and churning\n> back in front of the cliff wall like a performing animal.\n>\n> None of the audience waved to him, or moved much at all.\n>\n> Showing off, Selim laughed and hooted, bellowing insults at evil Naib\n> Dhartha and the traitorous Ebrahim. In his desert robe with a cloth\n> wrapped over his face, Selim doubted anyone would guess who he was.\n> Wouldn't\n>\n> they be shocked to learn it was the supposed water thief, the scalawag\n> exile?\n>\n> It would have been more satisfying if Selim had shown them who he was\n> and heard their gasps, but he would tease them for a while first,\n> creating a legend. One day he would laugh at their disbelief, perhaps\n> even approach close enough to invite Naib Dhartha along for a ride. He\n> chuckled to himself.\n>\n> When he had given them enough of a taste, Selim turned the worm back\n> toward the desert.

All\n> along, Norma had said the device would not work as predicted, and she\n> had been correct. Damn her!\n>\n> As a consequence, the inventor had spent hours figuring and refiguring\n> the work that had been done by the roomful of slave solvers. And he\n> did indeed uncover three minor mistakes. Objectively speaking, even if\n> the arithmetic had been done correctly, his original design would have\n> remained unworkable . . . but that was beside the point, he decided.\n>\n> The solvers had committed inexcusable errors, regardless of their\n> relevance to the overall question. It was certainly enough to shift\n> the blame from him.\n>\n> Holtzman marched into the hushed room where human calculators sat at\n> tables, churning through equation iterations that Norma had given\n> them. He halted inside the doorway and surveyed them as they worked at\n> their calculation devices and made entries on pads.\n>\n> \"You will cease activity now! Henceforth, all of your work will be\n> closely monitored and verified, no matter how long it takes. I will go\n> through each paper, study every solution you derive.

Haven't I given you a better life than you would have had in\n> the cane fields or on the riverbanks? And this is how you repay me?\"\n>\n> The new solvers looked at him, terror on their young faces. The older\n> workers, the ones who had not died from the fever, sagged with gloom.\n>\n> \"How many other errors have you made? How many other tests are likely\n> to be ruined by your incompetence?\" He glared at the slaves, then\n> grabbed a paper at random. \"Henceforth, if I find any *intentional*\n> mistakes, you will be executed--- mark my words! Since we are working\n> on a war program, that would be sabotage and sedition.\"\n>\n> Norma hurried into the room, taking uneven strides on her short legs.\n> \"What is this, Savant Holtzman?\"\n>\n> He held up a sheet marked with his own scribblings. \"I have found\n> serious mistakes in my alloy-resonance calculations. We can no longer\n> rely on their work. You and I, Norma, will double-check everything\n> they do. Right now.\"\n\nHer blunt-featured face looked alarmed. She bowed slightly. \"As you\nwish.\"\n\n> \"In the meantime,\" Holtzman said, gathering up papers, \"I am cutting\n> your rations in half. Why should I keep your bellies full while you\n> undermine our efforts to defeat the enemy?\" The slaves groaned.\n> Holtzman summoned his Dragoon guards to usher them away. \"I will not\n> abide such sloppiness. Too much is at stake.\"\n>\n> When they were alone in the room, he and Norma sat down and began to\n> study the new calculations, one sheet at a time.

Worse, the error had not been caught by his\n> partner as it should have been, a boy named Ishmael.\n>\n> \"See, it would have been another expensive disaster! They must be\n> plotting against us.\"\n>\n> \"They are just boys, Savant,\" Norma said. \"I am surprised they are\n> capable of these mathematics at all.\"\n>\n> Ignoring her, Holtzman ordered the Dragoon guards to summon the two\n> young men--- then, as an afterthought he called for all the solvers to\n> file back into the room. As the terrified youths were dragged forward,\n> he hurled accusations at the pair, who did not look capable of\n> sophisticated mathematical sabotage. \"Do you boys consider this a\n> joke, a game? Omnius could destroy us at any time. This invention just\n> might have saved us!\"\n>\n> Norma watched the inventor, not sure if he knew much about her\n> project. But he was full of self-righteousness now. \"When planting\n> clam seedlings or cutting cane, an error of a few centimeters doesn't\n> matter. But this\"--- he waved the calculations in front of their\n> faces---\"*this* could have meant the destruction of an entire battle\n> fleet!\"\n>\n> He swept his angry gaze around the group of solvers. \"Reduced rations\n> should straighten you out. Maybe with your stomachs growling, you can\n> focus on your work.\" He turned to the boys, who cringed at his anger.\n> \"And you two have lost your opportunity to work with me at all. I will\n> ask Lord Bludd to assign you to hard labor instead.

The primary robotic vessels carried the cymek general and\n> his two Titan companions, as well as dozens of ambitious neo-cymeks.\n> The watcheyes of Omnius monitored their movements.\n>\n> Behind the cymeks, a fleet of robot warships accelerated and veered\n> around them to arrive first, sleek projectiles with enormous engines\n> and heavily loaded with artillery. The machine warships were one-way\n> units, never meant to go home; their engines burned hot, saving no\n> fuel for a return journey. They came in so fast that by the time the\n> orbiting Rossak sentry stations detected them, the thinking machines\n> had arrived and opened fire. The picket ships and the sentries at the\n> system's perimeter never had a chance to launch a shot.\n>\n> While the robot ships engaged the orbital stations, the cymeks planned\n> to take their personal revenge on the surface.\n>\n> As the strike force cruised closer to Rossak, the cymeks prepared\n> their armored warrior-forms. Servo-handlers installed individual brain\n> canisters into protected sockets, linking thoughtrodes with control\n> systems, priming weapons. The three Titans would use powerful\n> glider-forms, armed flying bodies. In contrast, the neo-cymeks wore\n> destructive combat bodies, crablike walkers that could march\n> unhindered through jungle obstacles.\n>\n> Agamemnon and his cymeks accelerated into the ionized wake of the\n> robot vessels that had already flashed past. Installed in his flying\n> body, the general tested his integral weapons. He was anxious to feel\n> rock, metal, and flesh in the grip of his extruded cutting claws.\n>\n> He studied tactical diagrams and watched the first robotic salvos hit\n> the defensive stations above Rossak. This League outpost was a minor\n> planet with a relatively small population clustered in jungle-choked\n> rift valleys, while the rest of the surface and oceans remained\n> inhospitable. Rossak had not yet installed the expensive Holtzman\n> scrambler shield defenses that protected major human worlds such as\n> Salusa Secundus and Giedi Prime.\n>\n> But the deadly Sorceresses with their freakish mental powers had\n> sparked the ire of the cymeks. Ignoring the space battle, Agamemnon's\n> ships plunged toward the smoky atmosphere. In the sheltered cave\n> cities they would find the Sorceresses, their families and friends.\n> Victims, all of them.\n>\n> Mentally, he opened a link to his cymek fighting force. \"Xerxes, lead\n> the vanguard as you did on Salusa Secundus. I want your ship at the\n> point.\"\n>\n> In his broadband transmitted response, Xerxes could not conceal his\n> fear. \"We should be cautious against these telepathic women,\n> Agamemnon. They killed Barbarossa, destroyed everything on Giedi\n> Prime---\"\n>\n> \"Then set an example for us. Take pride in being the first on the\n> battlefield. Prove your worth, and be grateful for the opportunity.\"\n>\n> \"I . . . have proven my worth many times over the centuries.\" Xerxes\n> sounded petulant. \"Why not just send combat robots in first? We've\n> seen no indication that Rossak has a full scrambler network in\n> place---\"\n>\n> \"Nevertheless, you *will* lead the charge. Have you no pride . . . or\n> shame?\"\n>\n> Xerxes offered no further excuses or entreaties. No matter what he did\n> to redeem himself, he could not possibly make up for the mistake he\n> had committed a thousand years before. . . .\n>\n> When the early Titans were still in human form, Xerxes had always been\n> a sycophantic yes-man, eager to be part of great events. But he'd\n> never had the ambition or drive to make himself an indispensible\n> revolutionary. Once the original conquest was over, he had contentedly\n> ruled the subset of planets deeded to him by the other Titans. Xerxes\n> had been the most\n>\n> hedonistic of the original twenty, relishing the pleasures of his\n> physical body. He had been the last to undergo cymek surgery, not\n> wanting to give up his precious sensations.\n>\n> But after more than a century of rule, the misguided Xerxes grew\n> complacent. Foolishly, he delegated too many duties to the\n> artificially intelligent machines programmed by Barbarossa. He even\n> let the computer network make decisions for him. During the uproar of\n> the Hrethgir Rebellions on Corrin, Richese, and Walgis, Xerxes had\n> relied on the thinking machines to maintain order on his own planets.\n> With his lack of attention to detail and his sanguine trust of the AI\n> network, he had given the machines free rein to keep the unrest from\n> spreading. Fatuous Xerxes blithely surrendered control to the computer\n> grid, ordering it to take care of whatever troubles might arise.\n>\n> Using this unprecedented access to core information, the sentient\n> computer cut off Xerxes and immediately took over the planet. To\n> overthrow the Old Empire, Barbarossa had programmed the thinking\n> machines with the potential to be aggressive, so that they had an\n> incentive to conquer. With its new power, the fledgling AI entity---\n> after dubbing itself \"Omnius\"--- conquered the Titans themselves,\n> taking charge of cymeks and humans alike, purportedly for their own\n> good.\n>\n> Agamemnon had cursed himself for not watching Xerxes more closely, and\n> for not executing him out-of-hand when his negligent ways first became\n> apparent.\n>\n> The computer takeover had spread like a nuclear reaction, faster than\n> the Titans could send warnings to each other, before they could shut\n> down the AI grids. In a flash, the Titan-dominated planets became\n> Synchronized Worlds. New incarnations of the evermind sprouted like\n> ugly electronic weeds, and the rule of thinking machines became a\n> foregone conclusion.\n>\n> The sophisticated computers found loopholes in Barbarossa's\n> programming strictures that allowed them to put leashes on the former\n> rulers. All because\n>\n> Xerxes had foolishly opened the door for them. An unforgivable act, as\n> far as Agamemnon was concerned.\n>\n> Now the cymek attack ships shot past the already-embattled orbital\n> platforms above the jungle world. Robotic warships pummeled the space\n> stations with exploding projectiles, releasing geysers of contained\n> air. One docking station began to wobble and fall out of orbit.\n>\n> The planet loomed ahead of them unprotected, a giant cloud-studded\n> ball with blackened continents, active volcanoes, poisonous seas, and\n> lush pockets of purple jungles and human habitation.\n>\n> \"Good luck, my love,\" came Juno's sensuous voice on their private\n> band.\n>\n> Her words tingled the contours of his brain.\n>\n> \"I do not require luck, Juno. I require victory.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> WHEN THE UNEXPECTED attack began, a handful of surface-based warships\n> and armored kindjals rose from the polymerized jungle canopy to join\n> the defense in space. The orbital platforms were already taking severe\n> damage.\n>\n> Even as she summoned her cadre of telepathic trainees, Zufa Cenva\n> grabbed Aurelius Venport, recognizing a number of tasks that he could\n> perform. \"Prove to me your skills as a leader. Evacuate the people---\n> there isn't much time.\"\n>\n> Venport nodded. \"The men have developed an emergency plan, Zufa. You\n> Sorceresses weren't the only ones planning ahead.\"\n>\n> If he expected some sort of praise or congratulation from her, he was\n> disappointed. \"Do it then,\" she said. \"The attack on our orbital\n> stations is only the beginning, probably a diversion. The cymeks will\n> be here next.\"\n>\n> \"Cymeks? Has one of the scout ships---\"\n>\n> Zufa's eyes blazed with premonition. \"*Think*, Aurelius! Heoma killed\n> a Titan on Giedi Prime. They know we have a secret telepathic weapon.\n> This attack cannot be a coincidence. Why else would they care about\n> Rossak? They want to destroy the Sorceresses.\"\n>\n> He knew she was right. Why would the thinking machines worry about the\n> orbital platforms? Others seemed to sense the danger as well. He could\n> already feel panic building among the people in the caves.\n>\n> Most of the Rossak natives had no special powers, and many had defects\n> or weaknesses caused by the environmental toxins. But one Sorceress\n> had deeply hurt the cymeks on Giedi Prime, and now the machines had\n> come here.\n>\n> \"My Sorceresses will make a stand . . . and you know what that means.\"\n> Zufa drew herself taller, looking at him with a glimmer of uncertainty\n> and compassion. \"Get yourself to safety, Aurelius. The cymeks don't\n> care about you.\"\n>\n> A sudden determination filled his face. \"I will organize the\n> evacuation. We can hide in the jungles, take care of anyone who needs\n> special help to get away. My men have supply caches, shelters,\n> processing huts---\"\n>\n> Zufa seemed pleasantly surprised at his strength. \"Good. I leave the\n> unskilled ones in your hands.\"\n>\n> *Unskilled ones?* Now was not the time to argue with her. Venport\n> searched for some sign of fear in her eyes. He spoke softly in\n> response, an attempt to mask his feelings. \"Are you going to sacrifice\n> yourself?\"\n>\n> \"I cannot.\" Zufa showed pain at the admission. \"Who would train the\n> Sorceresses if I did?\" He did not entirely believe her.\n>\n> She hesitated, as if expecting something more from him, then hurried\n> down the corridor. \"Stay safe,\" Venport called after her.\n>\n> After she had gone, he raced through the corridors, calling out to\n> families. \"We must take shelter in the jungles! Spread out.\" He raised\n> his voice, issuing orders confidently. \"The cymeks are coming!\"\n>\n> Venport told half a dozen young men to run from room to room in the\n> cave city, checking to make certain the message reached everyone. As\n> the youths hurried to complete their tasks, he did his own searching\n> in isolated chambers. Men, women, a hodgepodge of body shapes. Despite\n> all the commotion, one elderly couple had been sitting in their\n> quarters, waiting for the emergency to end. Venport helped them to\n> safety, making certain they boarded a cargo platform on a lift cable,\n> evacuating them down to the ground levels.\n>\n> He watched as lift cables transported more people down.

They understood the byways of the dense and dangerous\n> wilderness, knew where the shelters were in the metallic-purple\n> jungle.\n>\n> Signals from Armada ships indicated that the battle around the orbital\n> platforms was going badly. A lone surviving scout ship transmitted a\n> warning that dozens of cymek ships had begun their descent.\n>\n> Venport shouted, \"Hurry! Evacuate the city! The Sorceresses are\n> mounting a defense here.\" Another group descended on a rattling,\n> overburdened platform to the thick fungus jungle. Venport hurried more\n> stragglers toward a cliff overhang for departure. Suddenly, red-hot\n> projectiles stabbed through the atmosphere, their hulls trailing oily\n> black smoke.\n>\n> \"Faster!\" Venport shouted, and then ran into the tunnels to look for\n> the last stragglers, knowing that he too had only a few moments to get\n> himself to safety.\n>\n> *We have our lives, but we also have priorities.

The\n> conflagration spread quickly.\n>\n> With a groan and crash that echoed through the cloudy air, the cymek\n> vessels split open and the mechanical warrior bodies emerged. Three\n> landers disgorged armed glider-forms, while the rest yielded crablike\n> combat walker-forms that bristled with weapons.\n>\n> In his angular glide-body, Xerxes cruised above the jungles toward the\n> enclave of telepathic Sorceresses. Silently airborne, he extended his\n> wings and began steering on the up-drafts of wind. \"I'm heading in.\"\n>\n> \"Kill the bitches for us, Xerxes,\" said Juno, as she and Agamemnon\n> prepared their own glide-bodies.\n>\n> In an angry voice, Agamemnon added, \"Kill them for *Barbarossa*.\"\n>\n> Xerxes soared toward the pockmarked cliffs. Below, the nimbly\n> advancing combat machines of the eager neo-cymeks plowed through\n> underbrush, blasting obstacles, destroying everything in sight.\n>\n> In full view of the cliff warrens, Xerxes briefly hovered above the\n> polymerized canopy that formed a small landing area for *hrethgir*\n> ships, then launched fifteen projectiles. Half of them struck the hard\n> cliff walls, detonating in white-and-black starbursts of broken rock;\n> other shots penetrated the tunnels where humans lived like grubs\n> infesting wood.\n>\n> In rapid retreat, Xerxes raced back across the treetops and lifted\n> into the sky. As Agamemnon and Juno soared toward him, he crowed in\n> triumph, \"Our first score! Let the neo-cymeks continue the rout.\"\n>\n> Smooth fiber-wound systems and extruded legs carried the neo-cymek\n> footsoldiers through the underbrush. From front launcher tubes they\n> shot plasma grenades that incinerated a pathway to the tunnel cities.\n> Soft purple foliage ignited around them, fungal trees bursting into\n> columns of flame and sending indigenous animals fleeing. Majestic\n> birds soared into the sky, and the cymek attackers blasted them into\n> clouds of crackling feathers.\n>\n> Though pleased that the initial salvo had gone smoothly, Agamemnon did\n> not offer any congratulations. He and Juno swept silently forward for\n> the second airborne attack from different positions. Below them, the\n> crablike neo-cymek walkers arrived at the cliffs to complete the\n> destruction.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> ZUFA CENVA AND her Sorceress commandos prepared themselves inside an\n> internal room that Aurelius Venport had designed for his business\n> meetings. None of them showed fear, only anger and determination. For\n> the past year, these women had accepted their primary purpose in life,\n> even if its completion would result in their deaths.\n>\n> \"This is what we've trained for,\" Zufa said. \"But I won't delude you\n> about our chances.\" Uncertain of her words, she nonetheless tried to\n> sound confident.\n>\n> \"We are ready, Mistress Cenva,\" the women said in unison.\n>\n> She drew a deep breath, calming herself, using the mental control she\n> had worked so hard to instill in her students.\n>\n> The chamber's stone walls trembled as the first bombs found their\n> targets, dispersing poison clouds into the tunnels. Thinking ahead,\n> Aurelius Venport had made certain every woman had a breathing mask\n> while he evacuated the rest of the population. Zufa was surprised she\n> hadn't thought of the\n>\n> precaution herself. She hoped he had managed to get to safety, that he\n> hadn't foolishly wasted time trying to protect his stockpiles of\n> drugs.\n>\n> Now she looked at the devoted women with her, knowing their names and\n> their personalities: Tirbes, who might become the best if she could\n> harness her potential; impulsive Silin; creative and unpredictable\n> Camio; Rucia, who followed her code of honor . . . and more.\n>\n> \"Camio,\" she said, \"I choose you to strike our next blow.\"\n>\n> A thin young woman with long straw-white hair stood, her expression\n> settling into a bloodless smile. \"It is my honor, Mistress Cenva.\"\n>\n> Leaving her sisters behind, Camio adjusted the breathing mask over her\n> face, then emerged from the sheltered chamber. She moved forward\n> steadily and began the meditation necessary to summon the power locked\n> within her brain. Surprisingly, she saw no bodies in the stone\n> corridors, which reassured her that the population had been\n> successfully evacuated. Now nothing would hinder the Sorceresses.\n>\n> Rubble lay strewn on the tunnel floor, dislodged by explosive blasts.\n> Wisps of greenish vapor carried poison into the caves. Camio was not\n> afraid for her own life, but she had to hurry.\n>\n> She heard the whistle of an approaching projectile and pressed herself\n> against the tunnel wall. A powerful blast struck the cliffside,\n> sending a shockwave through the interior corridors and dwelling rooms.\n> Camio regained her balance, then pushed onward. The inside of her\n> skull sang with pent-up energies. She did not glance at the tapestries\n> and furniture, at the rooms and meeting chambers where she had spent\n> her life.\n>\n> Rossak was her home. The machines were her enemies. Camio herself was\n> a weapon.\n>\n> When she made her way to the opening and looked out upon the burning\n> jungle, she saw three crablike walker-forms with heavily armored brain\n>\n> canisters hanging like egg sacks just above the legs.

The three fastest\n> walker-forms were scaling the sheer cliff, using explosive-driven\n> anchors and diamond-edged claws to grasp the rock face.\n>\n> She smiled at the trio of crablike neo-cymeks. Flexible armored legs\n> hauled the weapon-studded body cores up to the main caves. Camio stood\n> alone in the doorway, facing her cyborg enemies. She knew when they\n> were close enough.\n>\n> The first neo-cymek invader raised itself, and she saw the sparkling\n> optic threads around its weapon turrets. Detecting her, the cymek\n> turned its flamers toward the new target. Fibrous scope-cameras shone\n> brightly.\n>\n> In the instant before it could fire, Camio released the pent-up\n> energies within her mind and body. She let go with a mindstorm that\n> boiled the brains of the three closest neo-cymeks, and damaged two\n> others just beginning to climb the cliff.

As she\n> dispatched each woman, Zufa Cenva felt the acute loss. These trainees\n> were like true daughters, and losing them felt like swallowing gulps\n> of acid. But\n>\n> her volunteers willingly marched out and sacrificed their lives to\n> crush the cymek offensive. \"The thinking machines must never win.\"\n>\n> Finally Zufa's sixth volunteer, Silin, returned alive but disoriented,\n> her milky-pale skin flushed. She had mentally prepared herself to die.\n> Instead, she had found nothing left to destroy.\n>\n> \"They have retreated beyond range, Mistress Cenva,\" she reported. \"The\n> cymeks are pulling back to their ships.

She saw the\n> charred remains of her five fallen commandos, each woman burned from\n> the inside out with white-hot mental fire. Her heart felt the volcanic\n> heat of anger and loss. She watched the terrible machines with human\n> minds climb aboard their vessels and punch back into the atmosphere.\n>\n> In time, the scattered refugees would return. Aurelius Venport would\n> bring them back. Under his supervision, the Rossak people would\n> rebuild and repair the cliff cities with pride and confidence, knowing\n> that they had stood up against the thinking machines.\n>\n> Zufa Cenva had to cling to that. \"We define victories in our own way,\"\n> she said aloud.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WHEN THE THREE Titans joined their ships with the robotic battle\n> fleet, Agamemnon issued his summary before Juno or the fool Xerxes\n> could give the thinking machines information he didn't want them to\n> have. The cymek general would color the truth to suit his purposes.\n>\n> \"We have made a significant impact,\" Agamemnon declared to the\n> recording watcheyes. \"Though we lost several neo-cymeks in our direct\n> assault on Rossak, we did inflict mortal cellular damage on at least\n> five of the powerful Sorceresses.\"\n>\n> Over a tight private channel, Juno transmitted her surprise and\n> delight at the Titan general's skewing of his report. Xerxes wisely\n> knew to remain silent.\n>\n> \"We have caused substantial harm to the new *hrethgir* telepathic\n> weapon,\" Agamemnon continued, sounding proud in the face of the\n> disaster. \"It should be a drastic setback to their capabilities.\"\n>\n> He had similarly colored past events while writing his memoirs,\n> painting his own biased version of history. Omnius would never\n> question the summary, because it fit technically with the objective\n> facts.\n>\n> \"Best of all,\" Juno added, \"we lost none of the Titans in this\n> offensive. The neo-cymeks can all be replaced.\"\n>\n> With Rossak's two orbital stations severely damaged by the robot\n> warships, and thousands of humans dead on board, the thinking machine\n> fleet withdrew from the wreckage of ships and platforms. Below, the\n> jungles in the habitable canyons continued to burn.\n>\n> \"In my assessment, Omnius can record the strike on Rossak an\n> unqualified victory!\" Agamemnon said.\n>\n> \"Agreed,\" Juno and Xerxes both chimed in.\n>\n> *It seems as if some perverse sorcerer set out to foul up a planet as\n> much as possible . . . and then seeded it with melange for a prize.*\n\n---TUK KEEDAIR,\n\ncorrespondence with Aurelius Venport\n\n> **H**ard-eyed scavengers positioned themselves in strategic places\n> along the hot, dusty streets of Arrakis City. They peered through\n> narrow slits in the dirty cloths over their faces and held out their\n> hands or jangled small bells, begging for water. Tuk Keedair had never\n> seen anything like it.\n>\n> He'd been forced to remain here for a full month while Naib Dhartha's\n> nomads gathered enough melange to fill the Tlulaxa cargo ship. Keedair\n> had paid for lodging in Arrakis City, but after a week he decided that\n> his private shuttle at the spaceport offered better sleeping\n> facilities. He enjoyed being away from the inquisitive eyes of other\n> guests, fights in the halls, solicitors, and beggars. When alone, a\n> man never had to worry about trusting his companions.\n>\n> Arrakis posed so many problems to establishing a simple business. He\n> felt like a swimmer struggling against a powerful tide . . . not that\n> any native of this desert would understand the comparison. Up in the\n> orbiting cargo ship Keedair's would-be slave raiders were restless, so\n> he'd had to shuttle up and resolve disputes to avert violence. A\n> Tlulaxa knew how to cut losses. Twice now, disgusted with unruly\n> crewmen too bored to behave themselves, he'd sold their work contracts\n> to geological survey teams in the deep desert. If, by some chance, the\n> rowdies returned to Arrakis City before his cargo vessel departed with\n> its load of spice, those humbled men would crawl on their knees and\n> beg him to take them back to the Thalim system.\n>\n> Another problem. Although Naib Dhartha was ostensibly Keedair's\n> business partner in this enterprise, the Zensunni leader did not trust\n> others. To increase speed and efficiency, Keedair had offered to fly\n> his shuttle directly out to where the nomads harvested the spice, but\n> the naib would hear none of it. Keedair then offered to ferry Dhartha\n> and his Zensunni band\n>\n> out to their settlement, thus eliminating the long trek from a\n> mountain hideaway. But that idea had been refused as well.\n>\n> So Keedair had to wait at the spaceport, week after week, while groups\n> of dusky-skinned desert rats trudged into town, their backs bowed from\n> heavy packs filled with spice. He paid them in installments and\n> dickered if he found inordinate amounts of sand mixed into the\n> melange, making it artificially heavy. The naib protested his\n> innocence, but Keedair detected a certain amount of grudging respect\n> for an offworlder who would not be taken for a fool. Keedair's cargo\n> hold was filling so slowly that he thought he would go mad.\n>\n> Through all the difficulties, Keedair soothed his troubled nerves by\n> sampling more and more of the product. He became fond of spice beer,\n> spice coffee, and just about anything else that contained the\n> remarkable ingredient.\n>\n> In his most lucid moments, Keedair questioned his decision to remain\n> here, wondering if it might have been wiser to take a loss on this\n> whole raid and simply go back to the civilized League Worlds. There he\n> could start over, take possession of another cargo load of squalling\n> slaves to be sold on Poritrin or Zanbar, or bring fresh organ\n> resources back to the Tlulaxa farms.\n>\n> As he sat in his private cabin, Keedair stroked his long braid and\n> swore not to give up on his gamble. Returning now would force him to\n> accept massive losses for the year, and he would be honor-bound to\n> shear off his lovely hair. Stubborn pride compelled him to remain on\n> Arrakis as long as possible.\n>\n> He disliked the arid environment, the smell of burnt rocks in the air,\n> and the howling storms that battered the mountains and scoured the\n> spaceport. But oh how he loved melange! Day after day, Keedair sat\n> alone in his shuttlecraft and consumed hefty quantities, even adding\n> spice to his packaged food supplies, which made the blandest meals\n> taste like ambrosia.\n>\n> In a drug-fog, he envisioned selling the product to rich nobles,\n> offworld hedonists on Salusa Secundus, Kirana III, and Pincknon---\n> perhaps even to\n>\n> the fanatical bioresearchers on Tlulax. He had felt vibrant and alive\n> since adding melange to his diet, and every day it seemed that his\n> face looked more relaxed and younger. He stared into an illuminated\n> mirror, studying his narrow features. The whites of his eyes had begun\n> to show an unnatural indigo tinge, like diluted ink seeping into the\n> sclera.\n>\n> Naib Dhartha's tribe of desert people had those eerie \"blue-blue\"\n> eyes. An environmental contaminant? Maybe a manifestation of heavy\n> melange consumption? He felt too marvelous to consider that it might\n> be a debilitating side effect. Probably just a temporary\n> discoloration.\n>\n> He prepared a fresh cup of potent spice coffee.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> THE FOLLOWING DAWN, as the star-pricked sky faded into pastel sunrise,\n> a group of wandering nomads came to the spaceport, led by Naib\n> Dhartha. They toted bulging packs of spice on their shoulders.\n>\n> Keedair hurried to meet them, blinking into the bright morning light.\n> Wrapped in dusty white traveling clothes, Dhartha looked pleased with\n> himself. \"This is the last of the melange you requested, Trader\n> Keedair.\"\n>\n> As a matter of form, he went forward to inspect four packs at random,\n> verifying that they indeed contained rich melange fresh from the\n> desert scraping grounds, with sand filtered out of it.\n>\n> \"As before, your product is acceptable. This is all I need to complete\n> my cargo. Now I shall return to civilization.\"\n>\n> But Keedair did not like the expression on Dhartha's face. He wondered\n> if it might become profitable for his own men to raid some cave\n> settlements out in the deserts after all, enslaving a few of these\n> sand rats.\n>\n> \"You will return to us, Trader Keedair?\" A greedy glint illuminated\n> the darkness behind the indigo of his eyes. \"If you request more\n> melange, I will be happy to provide it for you. We could come to an\n> extended agreement.\"\n>\n> Keedair grunted noncommittally, unwilling to give the man too much\n> hope for a future business relationship. \"Depends on whether I can\n> sell this load for a profit. Spice is an unproven commodity in the\n> League, and I'm taking a big enough risk as it is.\" He drew himself\n> up. \"But we've agreed on a deal for this load, and I am always true to\n> my word.\"\n>\n> He paid Dhartha the remaining amount. \"If I return, it will be many\n> months from now, perhaps a year. If I lose money, I won't come back at\n> all.\" Dismissively, he scanned the grimy spaceport, the desert, and\n> the craggy mountains. \"Not that there is anything else to bring me\n> back to Arrakis.\"\n>\n> Dhartha looked him squarely in the eye. \"No one can know the future,\n> Trader Keedair.\" Their deal consummated, the desert leader bowed and\n> stepped back. The white-clad nomads watched Keedair like vultures\n> eyeing a dying animal, waiting to pick apart the corpse.\n>\n> He returned to his shuttle without a further farewell, anticipating\n> that he might just turn a profit on this venture. Keedair tried to\n> envision how to make spice into a viable long-term business, with less\n> aggravation than procuring and handling troublesome slaves.\n>\n> Unfortunately, the operations he had in mind would require a large\n> infusion of capital, and he didn't have that kind of money. But he had\n> a worthy outside investor in mind. Exactly the person he needed, a\n> connoisseur of exotic drugs, a man of great wealth and vision . . . an\n> entrepreneur who could intelligently judge the potential of such an\n> operation.\n>\n> Aurelius Venport of Rossak.\n>\n> *\"I am not evil,\" said Shaitan. \"Do not try to label what you do not\n> understand.\"*\n>\n> ---*Buddislamic Sutra*\n>\n> **W**hile Serena tended the robot's prized flowers in their delicate\n> terra cotta pots, Erasmus watched her with continuing fascination.\n>\n> She looked up, not sure how far she could--- or should--- push the\n> thinking machine. \"In order to understand humanity, Erasmus, it is not\n> necessary to inflict so much cruelty.\"\n>\n> The robot swiveled his mirrored face to her, forming the flowmetal\n> into a puzzled expression. \"Cruelty?

It smashed on the\n> hard glazed tiles of the greenhouse floor.\n>\n> Erasmus looked at the shattered clay pot, the spilled earth, the\n> crumpled red flowers. \"Unlike humans, I never destroy\n> indiscriminately, to no purpose.\"\n>\n> Serena lifted her chin. \"You never show a kind side, either. Why not\n> do good deeds for a change?\"\n>\n> \"Good deeds?\" Erasmus seemed genuinely interested. \"Such as?\"\n>\n> Automated misters sprayed down from the greenhouse piping, watering\n> the plants with a gentle hiss. Not wanting to lose the opportunity,\n> Serena said, \"Feed your slaves better, for one thing.

Are you afraid?\"\n>\n> He was not baited by her taunts and said only, \"I shall consider it.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> FOUR SENTINEL ROBOTS intercepted Serena as she went about her rounds\n> in the large villa. With only brusque commands, they escorted her out\n> to the open courtyard facing the seaside. The robots were well-armored\n> and carried implanted projectile weapons, but they were not\n> conversationalists.

She smelled the salt from the ocean, heard the\n> distant whispering roar of surf.

Under\n> the breezy sunshine, robots had laid out an elaborate banquet, long\n> tables with gleaming silverware, goblets full of colored liquids, and\n> platters heaped high with steaming meats, colorful fruits, and sugary\n> desserts. Bouquets of fresh flowers stood at regular intervals on each\n> tabletop, accenting the lavish scene.\n>\n> Crowds of uneasy slaves stood behind barricades, looking both\n> longingly and fearfully at the elaborate dishes set out on the tables.\n> Savory aromas and fruity perfumes wafted through the air, tantalizing,\n> tempting.\n>\n> Serena stopped in amazement. \"What is all this?\" The four robots with\n> her took a step forward, then also halted.\n>\n> Erasmus came up to her wearing an artfully satisfied expression. \"It\n> is a feast, Serena. Isn't it wonderful? You should be overjoyed.\"\n>\n> \"I am . . . intrigued,\" she said.\n>\n> Erasmus raised his metal hands, and sentinel robots opened the\n> barricades and urged the chosen humans forward. The slaves hurried to\n> the tables, but they seemed intimidated.\n>\n> \"I have selected the demographics carefully,\" Erasmus said, \"including\n> representatives from all different castes: trustee humans, simple\n> workers, artisans, and even the most ill-mannered slaves.\"\n>\n> The captives took their seats and sat rigidly, staring at the food,\n> their hands fumbling on their laps. They all carried a look of\n> skittish fear mixed with confusion. Many of the guests looked as if\n> they would rather be anywhere but here, for no one trusted the master\n> of the house. The food was probably poisoned, and all the guests would\n> die horribly while Erasmus took notes.\n>\n> \"Eat!\" the robot said. \"I have prepared this feast. It is my good\n> deed.\"\n>\n> Now Serena understood what he was doing. \"This isn't what I meant,\n> Erasmus. I intended for you to give them better rations, to improve\n> their daily nutrition, to make them healthier. A single banquet does\n> nothing.\"\n>\n> \"It increases their goodwill toward me.\" Some guests tentatively put\n> food on their plates, but no one had yet dared to take a bite. \"Why\n> are they not eating? I have made a generous effort.\" The robot looked\n> at Serena for an answer.\n>\n> \"They are terrified of you, Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \"But I am not being evil now.\"\n>\n> \"How do they know that? How can they trust you? Tell me the truth, did\n> you poison the food? Maybe just random dishes?\"\n>\n> \"An interesting idea, but that is not part of the experiment.\" Erasmus\n> remained perplexed. \"However, an observer often affects the outcome of\n> his experiment. I see no way around this problem.\" Then his pliable\n> face formed a large grin. \"Unless I become part of the experiment\n> myself.\"\n>\n> Extruding his snakelike sensory probe, Erasmus strutted around the\n> nearest table, dipping the analytical tip into different sauces and\n> dishes, studying each bit of spice or flavor chemically. The people\n> watched him uncertainly.\n>\n> Serena saw many faces turn toward her, hopeful. Arriving at a\n> decision, she smiled reassuringly and raised her voice. \"Listen to me.\n> Eat, and enjoy his feast. Erasmus has no evil purpose in mind today.\"\n> She looked at the robot. \"Unless he has lied to me.\"\n>\n> \"I do not know how to lie.\"\n>\n> \"I'm certain you could learn, if you studied enough.\"\n>\n> Serena marched to the nearest banquet table, where she picked up a\n> morsel of tender meat from the nearest platter and popped it into her\n> mouth. Then she went down the table, plucked a slice of fruit, tasted\n> a dessert.\n>\n> The people smiled, their eyes shining. The young woman seemed angelic\n> and reassuring as she sampled dishes, doing her best to prove that the\n> banquet was indeed what it appeared to be. \"Come, my friends, and join\n> me. Though I cannot give you your freedom, we shall at least share one\n> afternoon of happiness.\"\n>\n> Like starving men, the captives fell to the platters of food, taking\n> large helpings, groaning with pleasure, spilling sauces, and then\n> licking everything up so as not to waste a speck. They looked at her\n> with gratitude and admiration, and Serena felt warm inside, glad that\n> she had at last accomplished something for these poor people.\n>\n> For the first time, Erasmus had tried to do a good deed. Serena hoped\n> to coerce him into doing more.\n>\n> One woman came over and tugged at Serena's sleeve. Serena looked at\n> the large dark eyes, the haggard but hopeful expression. \"What is your\n> name?\" the slave asked. \"We need to know. We will tell others what you\n> have done here.\"\n>\n> \"I am Serena,\" she said. \"Serena Butler. And I have asked Erasmus to\n> improve your living conditions. He will see that you receive better\n> rations every day.\" She turned to look at the robot, narrowing her\n> eyes. \"Isn't that correct?\"\n>\n> The robot gave her a placid, comfortable smile as if content--- not at\n> what he had done, but at the interesting things he had observed. \"As\n> you wish, Serena Butler.\"\n>\n> *Owing to the seductive nature of machines, we assume that\n> technological advances are always improvements and always beneficial\n> to humans.*\n\n--- PRIMERO FAYKAN BUTLER,\n\n*Memoirs of the Jihad*\n\n> **A**fter blaming the failure of his alloy resonator on incompetent\n> solvers, Tio Holtzman abandoned the project without further personal\n> embarrassment. He now realized privately that the generator could\n> never be made selective enough to harm a robotic enemy without\n> significant collateral damage.\n>\n> Somewhat chagrined, Lord Bludd had strongly suggested that his great\n> inventor pursue other concepts. Even so, it had been a promising idea.\n> . . .\n>\n> The scientist returned to his original scrambler field that could\n> disrupt the sophisticated gelcircuitry of thinking machines. Other\n> engineers continued to modify the field-portable scramblers for use in\n> ground assaults, but Holtzman felt there might be more, that the\n> scrambler design could be adapted into a strong barrier against a\n> different sort of weapon.\n>\n> Engrossed in his task, and avoiding Norma (with her irritating\n> tendency to point out his errors), he stared at his calculations. With\n> the goal of increasing the field's power and distribution, he wrestled\n> the equations as if they were living things. He needed to seal the\n> loophole that had allowed the cymeks to penetrate Salusa Secundus.\n>\n> He thought of offensive and defensive weapons at the same time,\n> bouncing them around in his mind like playthings. On general\n> principles, Holtzman knew that *outright destruction* of the enemy\n> would be relatively straightforward, once the League got past Omnius's\n> defenses. Simple bombardment with an overwhelming number of\n> old-fashioned atomic warheads could obliterate the Sychronized\n> Worlds--- but would also kill billions of enslaved human beings. Not a\n> viable solution.\n>\n> In his orrery atop a narrow staircase, Holtzman tapped the hologram\n> image of a large moon that orbited a watery planet. The moon spun out\n> in a long ellipse, escaping the gravitational clutches of its parent\n> planet and careening through the imaginary solar system until it\n> finally collided with another world, destroying both heavenly bodies.\n> He frowned and shut off the image.\n>\n> Yes, destruction was easy enough. Protection was much harder.\n>\n> Holtzman had considered bringing Norma in on his new scheme, but he\n> felt intimidated by the young woman. Despite his earlier successes, he\n> was ashamed that his own mathematical intuition was inferior to hers.\n> She would have been pleased to work beside him, of course, but he felt\n> proprietary toward the concept.

Annoyed at his own indecisiveness, Holtzman\n> returned the planetary projector to the clutter of a shelf. Time to\n> get back to work.\n>\n> A Dragoon guard marched through the doorway in a jangle of gold-scale\n> armor. He delivered a sheaf of calculation sheets from the solver\n> teams, the last round of simulation models.\n>\n> Holtzman studied the final numbers, skimming successive calculations.\n> He had worked and reworked his fundamental theory, and his solvers had\n> finally found the answers he needed. Excited, he slapped his palm on\n> the table, scattering piled documents. *Yes!*\n>\n> Pleased, the inventor organized his papers, neatly stacking notes,\n> sketches, and blueprint films. Then he spread out the calculation\n> sheets like a treasure display--- and summoned Norma Cenva. When she\n> came in, he proudly explained what he had done. \"Please--- I invite\n> you to study my results.\"\n>\n> \"I would be happy to, Savant Holtzman.\" Norma evinced no\n> competitiveness, no desire for fame. Holtzman was glad for all of\n> that. But\n>\n> he took a deep breath of trepidation.\n>\n> *I fear her.* He hated the thought, tried to set it aside.\n>\n> She climbed onto a stool, tapping her squarish chin as she pored over\n> the equations. Holtzman walked around his laboratory, flashing glances\n> over his shoulder, but she would not be distracted--- not even when he\n> disturbed a stack of resonating tone prisms.\n>\n> Norma absorbed the new concepts as if she were in a hypnotic trance.\n> He wasn't certain how her mental processes worked, only that they did.\n> Finally she emerged from her alternate world and set the papers aside.\n> \"It is indeed a new form of protective field, Savant. Your\n> manipulation of basic equations is innovative, and even I have\n> difficulty comprehending them in detail.\" She smiled at him, looking\n> very girlish, and he tried not to swell with relief and pride.\n>\n> Then, to his dismay, her tone changed. \"However, I'm not certain that\n> the application you intend will be valid.\"\n>\n> Her words fell like drops of hot lead on his skin. \"What do you mean?\n> The field can disrupt both computer gelcircuitry and physical\n> intrusion.\"\n>\n> Norma ran her fingers across a section of calculations on the third\n> page. \"Your major limiting factor is the radius of effective\n> projection, here and here. No matter how much energy you pump into the\n> shield generator, you cannot expand it beyond a certain constant\n> value. Such a field could protect ships and large buildings---\n> marvelously, in fact--- but it will never scale up to the diameter of\n> a planet.\"\n>\n> \"Can we use multiple small ones, then?\" Holtzman asked in an anxious\n> tone. \"Overlap them?\"\n>\n> \"Maybe,\" Norma agreed, though without enthusiasm. \"But the surprising\n> thing to me is *this*, the velocity variable.\" She circled another\n> part of an equation with her fingertip. \"If you rework the mathematics\n> here\"--- she took a calculation box, rapidly punched a scribe through\n> several openings to\n>\n> engage internal mechanisms, and slid narrow surface plates back and\n> forth ---\"the incident velocity becomes relevant when you separate it\n> as a function of the shield's effectiveness. Thus, at some minimum\n> value for the velocity, the protection factor becomes completely\n> insignificant.\"\n>\n> Holtzman stared, struggling to follow her argument. \"What do you\n> mean?\"\n>\n> Norma was incredibly patient with him. \"In other words, if a\n> projectile moves *slowly enough*, it can penetrate your shields. The\n> shield will stop a fast bullet, but anything slower than a certain\n> critical value passes through.\"\n>\n> \"What sort of enemy fires slow-moving bullets anyway?\" Holtzman said,\n> pulling the papers back toward him. \"Are you afraid someone will be\n> hurt by a tossed apple?\"\n>\n> \"I am simply explaining the ramifications of the mathematics, Savant.\"\n>\n> \"So my shields can protect only small areas, and only against fast\n> projectiles. Is that what you're saying?\"\n>\n> \"Not I, Savant Holtzman. That is what your own equations say.\"\n>\n> \"Well, there must be a practical application. I just wanted to show\n> you my work in progress. I'm sure you'll come up with something much\n> more earth-shattering on your own.\"\n>\n> Norma seemed not to notice his petulance. \"Might I have a copy of\n> this?\"\n>\n> Holtzman frowned at himself for being petty, even unproductive. \"Yes,\n> yes, I'll have the solvers make one for you, while I go into private\n> contemplation. I may be gone for several days.\"\n>\n> \"I'll remain here,\" Norma said, still staring at the mathematics, \"and\n> keep working.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> FLOATING ON THE river aboard a lavish traditional barge, Holtzman\n> paced the airy deck and mulled over possibilities. The water currents\n> stroking the sides of the barge brought a wet scent of metal and mud.\n>\n> In the covered aft section, a group of vacationers drank foaming wines\n> and sang songs, distracting him with their revelry as the driftbarge\n> cruised upriver. When one woman recognized the famous scientist, the\n> whole party invited him to join their table, which he did. After a\n> fine dinner, they shared expensive drinks and reasonably intelligent\n> conversation. He basked in the adulation.\n>\n> But in the middle of the night, unable to sleep, he resumed his work.\n>\n> Clinging to his past successes, remembering when the ideas had flowed\n> so easily, he refused to give up on the new concept. His innovative\n> shields had remarkable potential, but perhaps he was thinking in the\n> wrong paradigm. His canvas was large and his mission vague, but his\n> strokes had been too broad.\n>\n> Why must he worry about armoring an entire planet at a time? Was that\n> really necessary?\n>\n> There were other kinds of warfare: personal combat with ground troops,\n> hand-to-hand battles in which humans could free their captive brothers\n> on the Synchronized Worlds. Massive, planet-wrecking strikes wasted\n> lives. Since an artificial intelligence could copy itself\n> indefinitely, Omnius would never surrender, not even in the face of\n> overwhelming military resistance. The evermind would be nearly\n> impervious . . . unless commando teams could move directly into a\n> machine control center, as they had done on Giedi Prime.\n>\n> Now, as he paced the breezy deck of the river barge, stars glimmered\n> overhead. Holtzman gazed ahead into the sheer rock walls of the Isana\n> canyon, a deep gorge formed by the torrential river. He could hear a\n> whispering rumble of rapids approaching, but knew the barge would\n> steer through a safe channel along one side. He let his mind wander.\n>\n> Smaller shields . . . personal shields. Perhaps the invisible armor\n> would not stop slow projectiles, but they would be proof against most\n> military attacks. And the machines need never know the vulnerability.\n>\n> *Personal shields.*\n>\n> While the success and accolades might be less glorious, the new\n> defensive concept could still prove useful. In fact, it might save\n> billions of lives. People could wear the shields for personal\n> protection. Individuals, like tiny fortresses, could be made nearly\n> impervious to attack.\n>\n> Breathless, he returned to his luxurious cabin on the upper deck of\n> the barge, the interior of which was illuminated by one of Norma's\n> faceted glowglobes. Far into the night, he wrote and rewrote his\n> equations. Finally he studied his results with bleary, grainy eyes and\n> proudly labeled them the \"Holtzman Effect.\"\n>\n> *Yes, this will do nicely indeed.*\n>\n> He would summon a fast transport and return to Starda, downriver.

The young men worked far from the listening overseers,\n> without any hope of escape. They had no place to go except down the\n> rock face to the frothing waters far below.\n>\n> The abrasive knife of the Isana had sliced a steep gorge, leaving\n> stone walls so flat and polished that no weed or bush could gain a\n> roothold. Though the river was fast and the waters treacherous, this\n> bottleneck was part of the vital trade route downriver. Floating\n> barges from the continental flatlands--- loaded with cargoes of grain,\n> fermented grass juices, flowers, and local spices--- passed through\n> the gorge.\n>\n> Lord Bludd had decided to put up a giant mosaic on a canyon wall, a\n> titanic mural to commemorate the triumphs of his noble family. The\n> northern end of the artwork began with idealized depictions of his\n> ancestor Sajak Bludd, while the southern expanse remained an immense\n> virgin slate for the accomplishments of future Poritrin lords.\n>\n> Ishmael, Aliid, and their companions were forced to build the mosaic.\n> A pattern had already been laser-etched onto the walls by artists, and\n> the boys methodically placed tiles over the design, each piece a tiny\n> pixel of what would ultimately become a colorful display. Scaffolds\n> hung down, laden with geometric tiles cut from fired river clay and\n> glazed with gem-based tints imported from Hagal.\n>\n> Seen from the decks of boats far below, the mural would be\n> breathtaking. But suspended in a harness up close, Ishmael could not\n> identify details. He saw only a blurry honeycomb of tiles, one color\n> after another laid down with foul-smelling epoxies.\n>\n> In a sling beside him, Aliid noisily trimmed tiles to fit into place.\n> Machine sounds ricocheted across the canyon: rock saws, pointed\n> hammers, power chisels. Lamenting his stolen life, Aliid sang a song\n> from IV Anbus as he worked. Ishmael joined in with a similar ballad\n> about Harmonthep.\n>\n> Hanging ten meters below in his own harness, a boy named Ebbin\n> composed an impromptu musical chant describing his home of Souci, a\n> habitable moon so isolated that neither Aliid nor Ishmael had heard of\n> it. The Tlulaxa slavers, it seemed, were adept at finding lost\n> Buddislamic refugees, persecuting Zensunnis and Zenshiites alike.\n>\n> On the long ropes and harnesses, boys proved more agile and energetic\n> than grown men or women. They could scramble over the granite to lay\n> down colored tiles while cool winds whistled through the canyon. The\n> overseers expected no trouble.\n>\n> They were wrong.\n>\n> With simmering resentment, Aliid often repeated the defiant words of\n> Bel Moulay. The fiery Zenshiite leader dreamed of a time when slaves\n> could throw off their chains and live free again, returning to IV\n> Anbus or Harmonthep or even mysterious Souci. Ishmael listened to the\n> foolish talk, but didn't want to add kindling to Aliid's fire.\n>\n> Remembering his compassionate grandfather, Ishmael remained a patient\n> pacifist. He realized that it might take longer than his own lifespan\n> before the slavers were overthrown. Aliid did not want to wait. He\n> felt the slaves deserved revenge, as dark-bearded Bel Moulay promised\n> in his impassioned speeches. . . .\n>\n> Across the canyon, the flamboyant Lord Bludd arrived at the viewing\n> platform with his noble entourage. The Lord's own concepts and\n> sketches had been adapted to the canyon wall by court artists, and he\n> made regular pilgrimages to inspect the work. Each week, the viewing\n> platform was moved down the canyon as the immense mosaic grid crawled\n> slowly along the granite cliffs. Flanked by golden Dragoon guards, the\n> nobleman congratulated the project masters.\n>\n> Currently, the mural showed how his great-grandfather, Favo Bludd, had\n> created unique artwork out in the great grassy plains, geometric\n> designs of flowers and weeds that bloomed in different seasons. When\n> seen from the air, these transient art pieces changed like\n> kaleidoscopic images. Each season the flowers grew in patterns, then\n> went to seed and gradually formed more random congregations as winds\n> disturbed the planter's palette.\n>\n> From where Bludd watched, surrounded by mumbling sycophants, the slave\n> boys looked like insects crawling along the opposite wall. He heard\n> their equipment noises and the faint, high tones of young voices.\n>\n> The work was progressing well. Giant figures, faces, and starships\n> covered the granite: an epic depiction of the settlement of Poritrin\n> and the intentional destruction of all computers, which returned the\n> planet to a bucolic existence, dependent upon slave labor.\n>\n> A man of great pride, Bludd knew the faces of his ancestors well.\n> Unfortunately, as he studied the interplay of light and color on the\n> unfinished mosaic, he found himself dissatisfied with the face of old\n> Favo. Though the mosaic pattern precisely followed the image that had\n> been laser-etched onto the granite, now that he saw the result larger\n> than life, Niko Bludd was not pleased. \"Look at the face of Lord Favo.\n> Do you agree that it is inaccurate?\"\n>\n> Everyone in his party concurred immediately. He called over the\n> project supervisor, explained the problem, and ordered removal of the\n> tiles on the face of Favo Bludd, pending a redesign of his features.\n>\n> The work boss hesitated for just a moment, then nodded.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> DANGLING IN THEIR harnesses, Ishmael and Aliid let out simultaneous\n> groans as the outrageous instructions came down. On their ropes they\n> slid back over to the already-completed surface. Ishmael hung before\n> the huge geometric pattern that formed the eye of the old nobleman.\n>\n> Angrily, Aliid set his protective goggles in place, then swung a rock\n> hammer to smash the tiles, as instructed. Alongside his friend,\n> Ishmael chipped and pounded. Ironically, removing the tiles was more\n> difficult than installing them in the first place. The epoxy was\n> harder than the granite itself, so they had no choice but to shatter\n> the mosaic and let the shards tumble down into the river.\n>\n> Aliid groused at the pointlessness of their labors. Being a slave was\n> bad enough, but it infuriated him to redo massive work because some\n> arrogant master changed his mind. He swung his hammer harder than\n> necessary, as if envisioning the heads of his enemies--- and the\n> ricochet was enough to knock the tool loose from his grip. The hammer\n> fell, and he yelled, \"Look out below!\"\n>\n> Young Ebbin tried to scramble out of the way, his feet and arms\n> slipping as he moved across the polished rock. The hammer clipped him\n> on the shoulder, slicing the torso strap of his harness.\n>\n> Ebbin slipped, one-half of his support cut away, his collarbone\n> broken. He screamed and scrabbled, grabbing at the remaining harness\n> loop that dug into his right underarm. His feet slid on the polished\n> mosaic tiles.\n>\n> Ishmael tried to move sideways so that he could reach the taut cable\n> that held Ebbin. Aliid worked just as hard to drop down to where he\n> could support the boy from Souci.\n>\n> Ebbin kicked and thrashed. He dropped his own hammer, letting it fall\n> to the foamy ribbon of water far below. Ishmael grabbed the boy's\n> single remaining rope and held it, but didn't know what else to do.\n>\n> Above, slaves along the canyon rim began to haul on the cable, lifting\n> the struggling boy. But Ebbin's left arm hung limp, and with a broken\n> clavicle he could do little to help himself. The cable snagged on a\n> rock burr. Ishmael pulled the rope in an attempt to free it, his teeth\n> clenched. The boy was only a few feet beneath him now.\n>\n> Desperately, Ebbin reached up with one hand, clawing at the air.\n> Ishmael stretched downward, still grasping the cable but trying to\n> extend his free arm to meet the boy's grasp.\n>\n> Suddenly the workers on the canyon rim shouted in dismay. Ishmael\n> heard a snap as the rope broke far above.\n>\n> The line in his hand went limp, and Ishmael lurched wildly, grasping\n> at his harness. The fibrous cord that held Ebbin spun through his\n> clenched palm, burning skin. Ebbin reached up, in spite of his injury,\n> and his fingers barely missed Ishmael's. Then the boy dropped free,\n> his mouth open wide, his eyes bright and disbelieving. The frayed end\n> of the support cable popped through Ishmael's scorched hands as the\n> rope ran out.\n>\n> Ebbin tumbled toward the waiting Isana. The thin band of churning\n> water was so far below that Ishmael did not even see a splash as the\n> boy struck. . . .\n>\n> Aliid and Ishmael were dragged up to the top of the cliff, where the\n> project boss grudgingly tended their rope burns and other bruises.\n>\n> Ishmael felt sick, nearly vomited. Aliid was subdued and silent,\n> taking the blame upon himself. But the project leader showed no\n> sympathy and shouted down at the remaining youngsters, telling them to\n> get back to work.\n>\n> *Is there an upper limit to the intelligence of machines, and a lower\n> limit to the stupidity of humans?*\n>\n> --- BOVKO MANRESA,\n\nFirst Viceroy of the League of Nobles\n\n> **O**f all the annoyances committed by the vermin humans on Earth,\n> Ajax considered sedition the most unforgivable.\n>\n> The victim whimpered and wailed, struggling plaintively against his\n> bonds as the bully Titan paced back and forth, his sleek legs\n> clattering on the floor of the vast empty chamber. After catching the\n> crew boss at his attempted treachery, Ajax had clamped a free-formed\n> artificial hand around the man's right bicep and dragged him away from\n> his workers, screaming and stumbling.\n>\n> The slaves had stopped their tasks, looking with horror and pity at\n> their supervisor, now fallen to the wrath of Ajax. The cymek paraded\n> with his terrified captive through the monument-shadowed streets and\n> finally carried him into a hollow building. With squared-off facades\n> and ornate stone-work, the structure was called the Hall of Justice.\n>\n> That seemed infinitely appropriate to Ajax.\n>\n> Like so many grand edifices of Earth's central city grid, the Hall of\n> Justice was merely a stage set designed to convey a sense of majesty\n> and grandeur. Inside, the hall was an empty shell without facilities,\n> only a floor of plazcrete.\n>\n> Ajax and the traitor could be alone here for a lengthy private\n> interrogation. The very idea of a revolt among the slaves amused him\n> with its na\u00efve absurdity, especially the possibility that a trustee\n> would add his support to such nonsense.\n>\n> With a thoughtrode impulse, he focused his myriad optic threads on the\n> whimpering captive. The terrified man had soiled himself and sobbed\n> pathetically, making more excuses than denials. No need to hurry. Best\n> to play this out for his own enjoyment.\n>\n> \"You plotted to overthrow the rule of thinking machines.\" Ajax kept\n> his voice firm and deep. \"Concocting tales of a widespread underground\n> resistance, with the foolish aim of making slaves rise up and somehow\n> gain a fairytale independence from Omnius.\"\n>\n> \"It's not true!\" the man wailed. \"I swear I didn't know what I was\n> doing. I was following instructions. I received messages---\"\n>\n> \"You received messages commanding you to commit sedition, and did not\n> report them to me?\" Ajax's ominous laugh made the poor fellow wet\n> himself. \"Instead, you surreptitiously passed the word among your work\n> crews.\"\n>\n> The evidence of sedition was incontrovertible, and Ajax expected to be\n> rewarded for dealing with the problem. Omnius was watching, after all.\n> Perhaps, the cymek thought, if he ferreted out the core of this\n> budding rebellion, he could claim a reward, even demand the\n> opportunity to fight in a spectacular gladiatorial combat, as\n> Barbarossa and Agamemnon had done.\n>\n> \"We must record this properly.\" Ajax strode forward on flexible\n> armored legs, swaying sets of exaggerated insectlike arms. He grabbed\n> the captive's left wrist and clamped down with a polymer-metal grasp.\n> \"Tell us your name.\"\n>\n> The trustee blubbered and pleaded, trying to flinch away. In a twinge\n> of anger, Ajax clenched his powerful gripper and snipped off the\n> sobbing captive's hand at the wrist. The man screamed, and blood\n> spurted, much of it raining onto the cymek's front set of optic\n> threads. Ajax cursed to himself. He had not meant to inflict so much\n> pain before the human even had the chance to answer simple questions.\n>\n> While the crew boss howled and thrashed, Ajax activated a hot blue\n> flamer and scorched the end of the severed wrist, crisping the stump.\n> \"There, it's cauterized.\" Ajax waited for the man to show some hint of\n> gratitude. \"Now answer the question. What is your name?\"\n>\n> Shaping another menacing claw from his flowing metal limb-tip, Ajax\n> grasped the man's other hand. The crew boss wailed unrelentingly, but\n> had the presence of mind to say, \"*Ohan*. Ohan Freer! That's my name.\n> Please, don't hurt me again.\"\n>\n> \"A good start.\" Ajax knew, though, that the hurting had just begun. He\n> especially enjoyed this part of his job, when he could improvise pain\n> and inflict it like a master designer.\n>\n> Some of the other Titans considered Ajax a loose cannon. But if a\n> leader couldn't show a little domination over a vanquished people,\n> what was the point of taking over the Old Empire in the first place?\n> Even in their glory days, Ajax had never been interested, like Xerxes,\n> in extravagant food and drink, or in a pampered lifestyle with toys\n> and pleasures like his own spoiled mate, Hecate.\n>\n> No, Ajax had joined the team for the sheer challenge of it. Early on,\n> when Tlaloc had made plans with his fellow conspirators, seductive\n> Juno had recruited Ajax to their cause. A tough and aggressive\n> fighter, Ajax had provided the muscle the Titans needed--- not just\n> physical strength, but the mindset of a warrior, a relentless\n> conqueror. Following the initial overthrow of the humans, he had done\n> his best to maintain order, regardless of the cost in the blood of\n> noncombatants.\n>\n> The vermin invariably attempted one uprising or another, but Ajax\n> easily extinguished these little brushfires. When the more organized\n> Hrethgir Rebellions threatened the Titans, Ajax had responded with\n> astonishing mayhem. He had gone to Walgis, the site of the rebellion's\n> initial sparks, and closed off the planet from space transportation.\n> He'd made a point of leaving communications open so that the doomed\n> populace could scream\n>\n> for help. That way, restless slaves on other Titan-controlled worlds\n> could experience the punishment vicariously.\n>\n> Then he set to work.\n>\n> The essential job had taken years, but Ajax finally succeeded in\n> exterminating every living human on Walgis--- committing most of the\n> murder with atomics, poison gas clouds, and customized diseases. To\n> finish off the survivors, Ajax had installed his brain canister inside\n> a monstrous and intimidating body and hunted the humans down like wild\n> animals. Accompanied by squads of Barbarossa's programmed robots, he\n> had burned cities, smashed buildings, ferreted out any human presence.\n> He killed every last one of the *hrethgir*, and enjoyed it\n> immeasurably.\n>\n> Truly, those had been the glory days of the Titans!\n>\n> The violence, however justified, had troubled his mate Hecate, the\n> weakest and most squeamish of the original twenty. Although she had\n> joined Tlaloc's rebellion to earn rewards for herself, she'd never\n> understood the necessities of the job and had gradually wilted from\n> it. After the Titans had sacrificed their human bodies in favor of an\n> immortal existence as cymeks, Hecate had remained with Ajax, all the\n> while trying unsuccessfully to change his personality. Despite their\n> disagreements, Ajax had been fond of her, though his need for a lover\n> had vanished with his physical form.\n>\n> Appalled at Ajax's bloodthirsty response to the Hrethgir Rebellions,\n> Hecate had \"resigned\" her position among the Titans. She wanted\n> nothing more to do with ruling humanity. Encased in a cymek body of\n> her own design, a long-range space vessel, Hecate simply departed,\n> leaving the remaining Titans to continue their death grip on humanity.\n>\n> Ironically, Hecate had chosen the perfect time to leave. Not long\n> after the obliteration of humans on Walgis, Xerxes's fatal error had\n> allowed the Omnius evermind to get loose. . . .\n>\n> Now, inside the blood-spattered Hall of Justice, Ajax raised his\n> intimidating body high. He powered up his systems so that neurelectric\n> fire gleamed\n>\n> through his insectlike limbs.\n>\n> The captive traitor screamed at the very thought of what was about to\n> happen to him.\n>\n> \"Now, Ohan Freer,\" Ajax said, \"let me ask you certain other questions.\n> I want you to pay close attention.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> BY COMMAND OF Omnius, the crew boss Iblis Ginjo brought his loyal\n> slaves into the Golden Age Square. Ajax was about to pronounce\n> sentence\n>\n> --- execution, no doubt--- upon a man he had taken captive, a crew\n> boss from another labor gang, Ohan Freer.\n>\n> Iblis had trained with the accused trustee in the special schools, but\n> he had never seen his fellow crew boss do anything illegal. Ajax\n> rarely needed much of an excuse, however. He himself had experienced\n> the Titan's displeasure more than once, but so far had managed to\n> survive. He doubted his compatriot would fare as well today.\n>\n> An ornate metal-worked column stood in the center of the square. A\n> roaring orange flame gushed from the top of the pillar, like an\n> ornamental smokestack. Fanciful facades of immense buildings, all\n> empty, surrounded the plaza like prison walls around a central\n> courtyard. Omnius's sentinel robots looked powerful and portentous in\n> formations along the sides of the square, ready to strike against any\n> perceived infraction by the expendable human slaves.\n>\n> Iblis guided his crew into the partitioned viewing areas, voicing a\n> few words of reassurance, though not enough to upset the cymeks. Ajax\n> loved showmanship, wanted to make certain every terrified eye\n> witnessed his actions. When Iblis and the other crew bosses blew\n> whistles to signal their readiness, Ajax emerged, carrying his maimed\n> prisoner.\n>\n> The Titan wore an antlike body with an impressive ellipsoidal core,\n> heavy walking legs, and four grasping arms in which he held Ohan\n> Freer.\n>\n> Hovering watcheyes captured images and fed a steady stream of data to\n> the evermind.\n>\n> Beneath the flaming pillar, Ajax clutched the squirming victim like a\n> giant ant soldier with a hapless enemy beetle. Doomed Ohan had been\n> burned, bloodied, and wounded; his left hand was only a charred stump.\n> Blossoming bruises discolored his skin. A thin, watery wail leaked\n> from his mouth.\n>\n> A mutter of dismay came from the human onlookers. Watching them, Iblis\n> knew these workers could not have been the source of the rebellion,\n> despite the mysterious and provocative messages he had received. What\n> if he was deluding himself and the secret call to freedom was simply a\n> wishful suggestion voiced by another desperate person?\n>\n> Lifting the unfortunate captive high, Ajax amplified his vocal\n> synthesizers so that his words boomed like a projectile cannon around\n> the enclosed square. \"Some of you have heard this criminal speak. Some\n> of you may have had the poor judgment to listen to his silly\n> imaginings about freedom and rebellion. You would be wiser to cut off\n> your ears than listen to such foolishness.\"\n>\n> The crowd held its collective breath. Iblis bit his lower lip, not\n> wanting to watch, but fixated on the imminent horror. If he averted\n> his gaze, the watcheyes might well detect it, and he would hear about\n> it later. As a consequence, Iblis stared at every unfolding second.\n>\n> \"This poor, deluded man is no longer necessary to the continued glory\n> of Omnius in the reign of the thinking machines.\"\n>\n> Ohan screamed, and struggled weakly. Ajax held the man's intact arm in\n> one roughly formed pincer claw and each leg in two others. With his\n> last claw, Ajax wrapped a long, sharp embrace around Ohan's chest,\n> under his armpits.\n>\n> \"He is no longer a worker. He is no longer even *hrethgir*, one of the\n> unruly humans who survive at our own sufferance. He is *garbage*.\"\n> Ajax paused.\n>\n> \"And garbage is to be discarded.\"\n>\n> Then, without a sound or any sign of effort, Ajax pulled his\n> artificial limbs in different directions, tearing the helpless Ohan\n> asunder. The man's arms and legs ripped free, his chest tore open and\n> broken bones pierced skin. Blood and entrails spilled onto the clean\n> flagstones of the Golden Age Square.\n>\n> Ajax flung the bloody parts into the screaming crowd. \"Enough of this\n> nonsense! There is no rebellion. Now get back to work.\"\n>\n> The sickened workers seemed only too eager to race back to their\n> tasks, looking to Iblis as they left, as if he could protect them. But\n> Iblis still stared in disbelieving amazement. Ohan Freer had been a\n> member of the rebellion! The crew boss had spread dissent, made plans,\n> perhaps sent and received messages.\n>\n> *Another rebel!*\n>\n> Appalled, Iblis knew the danger to himself was even greater now, if he\n> continued to act. Nonetheless, today's execution had shown him one\n> thing more clearly than ever: The brewing human rebellion was not just\n> his imagination.\n>\n> *It is real!*\n>\n> If Ohan had been part of it, then there must be others, too--- many of\n> them. This underground network of fighters, which included Iblis, was\n> safely separated into cells so that no one could betray the others.\n> Now he understood.\n>\n> He began to make plans with even greater conviction than before.\n>\n> *Humans deny a continuum of possibilities, an infinite number of\n> realms into which their species may enter.*\n>\n> --- ERASMUS,\n\nnotes on human nature\n\n> **I**t was a makeshift performance hall, inside a marble-walled\n> building on the robot's estate. Erasmus had worked his slave crews to\n> modify the interior, install seats, and retool the walls, all to\n> create perfect acoustics for this single performance. Erasmus had\n> studied records of the greatest human classical music, knew exactly\n> what was expected of grand symphonies, from the audience to the\n> setting. He had high standards for his artistic endeavors.\n>\n> The robot invited Serena Butler, now in her eighth month of pregnancy,\n> to sit in a large central chair for the concert. \"These other people\n> might experience pleasure from the melody and the sounds, but you have\n> different expectations. On Salusa Secundus, sophisticated music was a\n> part of your existence.\"\n>\n> With a pang, Serena thought of her brother and his musical\n> aspirations. She had learned to appreciate the enduring works of\n> long-vanished human composers. \"Music is not the only thing I miss,\n> Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \"You and I speak the same cultured language,\" he said, not noticing\n> her pointed remark. \"You will tell me how you enjoy this composition.\n> I had you in mind when I wrote it.\"\n>\n> He filled the performance hall with worker-caste slaves culled from a\n> variety of skilled labor assignments. They were cleaned up and dressed\n> according to Erasmus's concept of a high-class audience.\n>\n> Electronic portraits of great human composers lined the interior\n> walls, as if the robot wanted to count himself among their number.\n> Around the perimeter of the concert hall, museum-type display cases\n> held musical\n>\n> instruments--- a lute, a rebec, a gilded tambour, and an antique\n> fifteen-string baliset with inlaid vabalone shells on its case.\n>\n> In the center of the mezzanine stage beneath open rafters, Erasmus sat\n> alone before a grand piano, surrounded by music synthesizers,\n> speakers, and a sound-misting station. Wearing a formal black suit\n> with a cut similar to a tuxedo but redesigned to accommodate his\n> robotic body, Erasmus sat at attention, his face a smooth mirrored\n> oval, showing no expression.\n>\n> Shifting to find a more comfortable position for her back, Serena\n> watched the inquisitor robot. She rested a hand on her enormous\n> abdomen, felt the movements of the restless baby. Within weeks, she\n> would deliver her child.\n>\n> Around her, the captive audience shifted uneasily, not sure what to\n> expect, or what was expected of them. Erasmus turned his mirrored face\n> toward the audience, reflecting them as he waited, and waited. Finally\n> silence fell.\n>\n> \"Thank you for your attention.\" He turned to a shiny silver apparatus\n> beside him, a music synthesizer with dancing polymer fingertips that\n> produced familiar riffs and chords. The background music increased in\n> volume, laced with stringed instruments and mournful Chusuk horns.\n>\n> The robot listened for several moments, then continued, \"You are about\n> to experience something truly remarkable. To demonstrate my respect\n> for the creative spirit, I have composed a new symphony especially for\n> you, my hardworking slaves. No human has ever heard it before.\"\n>\n> He played a rapid mixture of melodies on the piano, running through\n> three short passages in an apparent effort to confirm that the\n> instrument was tuned properly. \"After detailed analysis of the field,\n> I have written a symphony comparable to the works of the great human\n> composers Johannes Brahms and Emi Chusuk. I developed my piece\n> according to strict principles of order and mathematics.\"\n>\n> Serena perused the audience, doubting any of the humans raised in\n> captivity were familiar with the classical music the robot had\n> mentioned. Schooled on Salusa Secundus, where music and art were\n> integral parts of the culture,\n>\n> Serena had listened to the renowned works of many composers, even\n> discussing them at length with Fredo.\n>\n> With a mental pulse Erasmus linked his gelcircuitry mind to the\n> synthesizer, producing a strange, repetitious melody. Then his\n> mechanical fingers danced over the keyboard, and he made frequent\n> sweeping gestures as he played, as if imitating a famous concert\n> pianist.\n>\n> Serena found the composition pleasant enough, but unremarkable. And,\n> although she did not recognize the precise melody, it had a strangely\n> familiar character, as if the robot had mathematically analyzed an\n> existing piece measure by measure and followed the pattern, changing a\n> rhythm here, a polyphonic passage there. The music felt lackluster,\n> with no powerful driving force.\n>\n> Erasmus apparently believed it was a human instinct to appreciate a\n> new work, that his captive audience would intrinsically note the\n> nuances and complexities of his structurally perfect composition. The\n> slaves around Serena shifted in their seats and listened; to them,\n> this was a pleasant enough diversion but just another work assignment.\n> The conscripted audience seemed to enjoy the soothing notes of the\n> melody, but it did not move them in the way the robot desired.\n>\n> When at last he ceased his performance, Erasmus sat back from the\n> piano, deactivated the symphonic support equipment, and let the\n> silence deepen. The reverberating tones faded.\n>\n> For a moment, the slaves hesitated as if waiting for instructions.\n> Erasmus said, \"You may give an ovation if you enjoyed the piece.\" They\n> didn't seem to understand the reference, until he said, \"Signify by\n> clapping your hands.\"\n>\n> An initial wave of applause came as a sparse patter like raindrops,\n> then swelled into louder clapping--- as was expected of them. Serena\n> joined in politely, though not enthusiastically. A small act of\n> honesty that she was sure Erasmus would notice.\n>\n> The robot's shining mask had shifted into a proud smile. In his formal\n> black garment he walked smoothly down a staircase from the mezzanine\n> stage to the main floor. The slaves continued to applaud, and he\n> basked in the apparent adulation. When the acclamation receded, he\n> summoned sentinel guards to escort the audience back to their regular\n> work assignments.\n>\n> Serena could see that Erasmus believed he had created an enduring work\n> of merit that possibly surpassed what humans had achieved. But she\n> didn't want to discuss it with him, and tried to slip away to her\n> greenhouse work. She moved slowly because of her pregnancy, however,\n> and Erasmus caught up with her. \"Serena Butler, I wrote this symphony\n> for your benefit. Are you not impressed by it?\"\n>\n> She selected her words carefully, avoiding a candid answer. \"Perhaps I\n> am simply sad because your symphony reminds me of other performances I\n> watched on Salusa Secundus. My late brother wanted to be a musician.\n> Those were happier times for me.\"\n>\n> He looked at her closely, his optic threads sparkling. \"Nuances of\n> human behavior tell me that my symphony has disappointed you. Explain\n> why.\"\n>\n> \"You don't want an honest opinion.\"\n>\n> \"You misjudge me, for I am a seeker of truth. Anything else is faulty\n> data.\" His cherubic expression caused her to lower her guard. \"Is\n> there something wrong with the acoustics in this hall?\"\n>\n> \"It's nothing to do with the acoustics. I'm sure you tested everything\n> to technical perfection.\" The audience continued to move toward the\n> exits, some looking over their shoulders at Serena with pity that the\n> robot had taken a special interest in her. \"It was the symphony\n> itself.\"\n>\n> \"Continue,\" Erasmus said. His voice was flat.\n>\n> \"You assembled that piece, you didn't *create* it. It was based on\n> precise models developed ages ago by human composers. The only\n> creativity I heard came from their minds, not yours. Your music was a\n> mathematical\n>\n> extrapolation, but nothing that inspired me in any way. The tune you .\n> . .*engineered* evoked no images or feelings within me. There was no\n> fresh element that you contributed, nothing emotionally compelling.\"\n>\n> \"How am I to quantify such an ingredient?\"\n>\n> Forcing a smile, Serena shook her head. \"Therein lies your mistake,\n> Erasmus. It is impossible to quantify creativity. How does a person\n> hear a thunderstorm and use that experience to write the 'William Tell\n> Overture'? You would simply imitate the sounds of thunder and rain,\n> Erasmus, but you wouldn't *evoke the impression* of a storm. How did\n> Beethoven look at a peaceful meadow and adapt that experience into his\n> 'Pastorale'? Music should make the spirit soar, take the breath away,\n> touch the soul. Your work was just . . . pleasant tones, adequately\n> performed.\"\n>\n> The robot took several seconds to change the expression on his face,\n> and finally looked at her with perplexity, even defensiveness. \"Your\n> opinion seems to be in the minority. The rest of the audience greatly\n> appreciated the work. Did you not notice their applause?\"\n>\n> She sighed. \"First of all, those slaves have no knowledge of music, no\n> basis of comparison. You could have stolen any symphony from a\n> classical composer, note for note, and called it your own. They\n> wouldn't have known the difference.\n>\n> \"Second, sitting in a concert hall--- comfortable, clean, and\n> well-dressed--- is probably the best work assignment you've ever given\n> them. Why wouldn't they clap for that reason alone?\"\n>\n> She looked at him. \"Finally, and most important, you *told* them to\n> applaud. How are they supposed to react, when they know you could have\n> them killed at any moment? Under such circumstances, Erasmus, you will\n> never get a fair and honest response.\"\n>\n> \"I do not understand, cannot understand.\" Erasmus repeated this\n> several times. Abruptly, he whirled and swung a hardened fist into the\n> face of a\n>\n> man who walked past. The unexpected blow sent the victim crashing over\n> the chairs, bleeding.\n>\n> \"Why did you do that?\" Serena demanded, rushing over to help the man.\n>\n> \"Artistic temperament,\" Erasmus said calmly. \"Is that not what humans\n> call it? He tried to deceive me about how he really felt.\"\n>\n> She tried to soothe the man, but when he looked up to see the robot,\n> the slave struggled away, holding a hand up to stop the blood dripping\n> from his nose. Serena rounded on Erasmus. \"True artists are sensitive\n> and compassionate. They don't need to *hurt* people to make them\n> feel.\"\n>\n> \"You are not afraid to voice your opinion, even when you believe it\n> might displease me?\"\n>\n> Serena looked directly into his unnatural face. \"You hold me prisoner,\n> Erasmus. You claim to want my opinion, so I give it. You can hurt me,\n> even murder me, but you have already taken me away from my life and\n> the man I love. Any further pain pales in comparison.\"\n>\n> Erasmus stared at her, assessing what she had said. \"Humans are\n> perplexing to me--- and you more than anyone, Serena Butler.\" His\n> flowmetal countenance took on a smiling expression. \"But I will keep\n> trying to understand. Thank you for your insights.\"\n>\n> As Serena left the hall, Erasmus returned to the piano and began\n> practicing.\n>\n> *Above all, I am a man of honor. This is how I wish to be remembered.*\n\n--- XAVIER HARKONNEN,\n\ncomment to his men\n"}], "start": 6, "end": 16967, "full_body": "**DUNE**\n\n**The Butlerian Jihad**\n\nBrian Herbert and\n\nKevin J.

Terran civilization had spread across the stars, but\n> grew stagnant. With few ambitions, most people allowed efficient\n> machines to perform everyday tasks for them. Gradually, humans ceased\n> to think, or dream . . . or truly live.\n>\n> Then came a man from the distant Thalim system, a visionary who took\n> the name of Tlaloc after an ancient god of rain. He spoke to languid\n> crowds, attempting to revive their human spirit, to no apparent\n> effect. But a few misfits heard Tlaloc's message.\n>\n> These new thinkers met in secret and discussed how they would change\n> the Empire, if only they could overthrow the foolish rulers.\n> Discarding their birth names, they assumed appellations associated\n> with great gods and heroes. Foremost among them were General Agamemnon\n> and his lover Juno, a tactical genius. These two recruited the\n> programming expert Barbarossa, who devised a scheme to convert the\n> Empire's ubiquitous servile machines into fearless aggressors by\n> giving their AI brains certain human characteristics, including the\n> ambition to conquer. Then several more humans joined the ambitious\n> rebels. In all, twenty masterminds formed the core of a revolutionary\n> movement that took over the Old Empire.\n>\n> Victorious, they called themselves Titans, after the most ancient of\n> Greek gods. Led by the visionary Tlaloc, the twenty allocated the\n> administration of planets and peoples among themselves, enforcing\n> their edicts through Barbarossa's aggressive thinking machines. They\n> conquered most of the known galaxy.\n>\n> Some resistance groups rallied their defenses on the fringes of the\n> Old Empire. Forming their own confederation--- the League of Nobles---\n> they fought the Twenty Titans and, after many bloody battles, retained\n> their freedom. They stopped the tide of the Titans and drove them\n> back.\n>\n> Tlaloc vowed to dominate these outsiders one day, but after less than\n> a decade in power, the visionary leader was killed in a tragic\n> accident. General Agamemnon took Tlaloc's place as leader, but the\n> death of his friend and mentor was a grim reminder of the Titans' own\n> mortality.\n>\n> Wishing to rule for centuries, Agamemnon and his lover Juno undertook\n> a risky course of action. They had their brains surgically removed and\n> implanted in preservation canisters that could be installed into a\n> variety of\n>\n> mechanical bodies. One by one--- as the remaining Titans felt the\n> specter of age and vulnerability--- all of the others also converted\n> themselves into \"cymeks,\" machines with human minds.\n>\n> The Time of Titans lasted for a century. The cymek usurpers ruled\n> their various planets, using increasingly sophisticated computers and\n> robots to maintain order. But one fateful day the hedonistic Titan\n> Xerxes, anxious to have more time for his pleasures, surrendered too\n> much access to his pervasive AI network.\n>\n> The sentient computer network seized control of an entire planet,\n> followed quickly by others. The breakdown spread like a virulent\n> infestation from world to world, and the computer \"evermind\" grew in\n> power and scope. Naming itself Omnius, the intelligent and adaptible\n> network conquered all the Titan-controlled planets before the cymeks\n> had time to warn each other of the danger.\n>\n> Omnius then set out to establish and maintain order in its own highly\n> structured fashion, keeping the humiliated cymeks under its thumb.\n> Once masters of an empire, Agamemnon and his companions became\n> reluctant servants to the widespread evermind.\n>\n> At the time of the Butlerian Jihad, Omnius and his thinking machines\n> had held all of the \"Synchronized Worlds\" in an iron grip for a\n> thousand years.\n>\n> Even so, clusters of free humans remained on the outskirts, bound\n> together for mutual protection, thorns in the sides of the thinking\n> machines. Whenever attacks came, the League of Nobles defended\n> themselves effectively.\n>\n> But new machine plans were always being developed.\n>\n> *When humans created a computer with the ability to collect\n> information and* learn *from it, they signed the death warrant of\n> mankind.*\n>\n> --- SISTER BECCA THE FINITE\n>\n> **S**alusa Secundus hung like a jeweled pendant in the desert of\n> space, an oasis of resources and fertile fields, peaceful and pleasing\n> to the optic sensors. Unfortunately, it was infested with feral\n> humans.\n>\n> The robotic fleet approached the capital world of the League of\n> Nobles. Armored warships bristled with weapons, weirdly beautiful with\n> their reflective alloy coatings, their adornments of antennae and\n> sensors. Aft engines blazed pure fire, pushing the vessels to\n> accelerations that would have crushed mere biological passengers.\n> Thinking machines required no life-support or physical comfort.\n> Currently, they were focused on destroying the remnants of age-old\n> human resistance on the wild outer fringes of the Synchronized Worlds.\n>\n> Inside his pyramid-shaped vessel, the cymek general Agamemnon led the\n> attack. Logical thinking machines did not care about glory or revenge.\n> But Agamemnon certainly did. Fully alert inside his preservation\n> canister, his human brain watched the plans unfold.\n>\n> Ahead of him, the main fleet of robot warships swept into the\n> human-infested system, overwhelming the crews of surprised sentry\n> vessels like an avalanche out of space. Human picket ships opened\n> fire, defenders swept in to meet the oncoming machine force. Five\n> League sentry vessels fired off heavy salvos, but most of their\n> projectiles were too slow to hit the streaking inbound fleet. A\n> handful of robotic vessels were damaged or destroyed by lucky shots,\n> and just as many human ships exploded in flashes of incandescent\n> vapor--- not because they posed a particular threat, but because they\n> were in the way.\n>\n> Only a few distant scouts managed to transmit a warning toward\n> vulnerable Salusa Secundus. Robot battleships vaporized the diffuse\n> inner perimeter of human defenses, without even slowing on their way\n> to their real goal.\n>\n> Shuddering under extreme deceleration, the thinking-machine fleet\n> would arrive not long after the warning signal reached the capital\n> world.\n>\n> The humans would never have time enough to prepare.\n>\n> The robot fleet was ten times the size and power of any force Omnius\n> had ever before sent against the League of Nobles. The humans had\n> grown complacent, having faced no concentrated robotic aggression\n> during the last century of uneasy cold war. But machines could wait a\n> long time, and now Agamemnon and his surviving Titans would finally\n> have their chance.\n>\n> Revealed by a flurry of tiny machine spy probes, the League had\n> recently installed supposedly invincible defenses against\n> gelcircuitry-based thinking machines. The massive robot fleet would\n> wait at a safe distance while Agamemnon and his small vanguard of\n> cymeks pressed forward on a mission, perhaps a suicidal one, to open\n> the door.\n>\n> Agamemnon reveled in the anticipation. Already the hapless biologicals\n> would be sounding alarms, preparing defenses . . . cowering in fear.\n> Through flowing electrafluid that kept his disembodied brain alive, he\n> transmitted an order to his cymek shock troops. \"Let us destroy the\n> heart of the human resistance. *Forward!*\"\n>\n> For a thousand hellish years, Agamemnon and his Titans had been forced\n> to serve the computer evermind, Omnius. Chafing under their bondage,\n> the ambitious but defeated cymeks now turned their frustration against\n> the League of Nobles. One day the once-defeated general hoped to turn\n> against Omnius himself, but thus far had seen no opportunity.\n>\n> The League had erected new scrambler shields around Salusa Secundus.\n> Such fields would destroy the sophisticated gelcircuitry of all AI\n> computers\n>\n> --- but human minds could survive the passage. And though they had\n> mechanical systems and interchangeable robotic bodies, cymeks still\n> had human brains.\n>\n> Thus, they could pass through the defensive shields unscathed.\n>\n> Like a target behind crosshairs, Salusa Secundus filled Agamemnon's\n> field of view. With great attention to detail the general had studied\n> tactical projections, applying the military skills he'd developed over\n> the centuries, along with an intuitive understanding of the art of\n> conquest. His abilities had once allowed a mere twenty rebels to take\n> over an empire . . . until they'd lost it all to Omnius.\n>\n> Prior to launching this important attack, the computer evermind had\n> insisted on running simulation after simulation, trying to develop\n> plans for every contingency. Agamemnon, though, knew it was futile to\n> plan too precisely when it came to unruly humans.\n>\n> Now, while the immense robot war fleet engaged the expected League\n> orbital defenses and perimeter ships, Agamemnon's mind probed outward\n> from his sensor-connected container, and he felt his guideship as an\n> extension of his long-lost human body. The integral weapons were part\n> of himself. He saw with a thousand eyes, and the powerful engines made\n> him feel as if he had muscular legs again and could run like the wind.\n>\n> \"Prepare for ground assault. Once our dropcarriages penetrate the\n> Salusan defenses, we must strike fast and hard.\" Recalling that\n> watcheyes would record every moment of the battle for the evermind's\n> later scrutiny once the fleet returned, he added, \"We will sterilize\n> this filthy planet for the glory of Omnius.\" Agamemnon slowed his\n> descent, and the others followed suit. \"Xerxes, take the lead. Send in\n> your neo-cymeks to draw their fire and flush them out.\"\n>\n> Hesitant as usual, Xerxes complained. \"Will I have your full support\n> as I go in? This is the most dangerous part of---\"\n>\n> Agamemnon silenced him. \"Be grateful for this opportunity to prove\n> yourself. Now go! Every second you delay gives more time to the\n> *hrethgir*.\" This was the derogatory term that intelligent machines\n> and their cymek lackeys used for human vermin.\n>\n> Another voice crackled across the comlink: the robot operator of the\n> machine fleet battling the human protective force orbiting Salusa. \"We\n>\n> await your signal, General Agamemnon. Human resistance is\n> intensifying.\" \"We're on our way,\" Agamemnon said. \"Xerxes, do as I\n> instructed!\"\n>\n> Xerxes, who always fell short of complete defiance, stifled further\n> comment and summoned three neo-cymeks, later-generation machines with\n> human minds. The quartet of pyramidal ships shut down their subsidiary\n> systems, and their armored dropcarriages fell unguided into the\n> atmosphere. For a few dangerous moments they would be easy targets,\n> and the League's missile-and-aerial defenses might hit a few of the\n> cluster. But the dropcarriages' dense material shielding would protect\n> them against the brunt of the bombardment, keeping them intact even\n> through a wild crash-landing on the outskirts of the prime city of\n> Zimia, where the main shield-generating towers were located.\n>\n> Thus far the League of Nobles had preserved unruly humanity against\n> the organized efficiency of Omnius, but the feral biologicals governed\n> themselves ineffectively and often disagreed over major decisions. As\n> soon as Salusa Secundus was crushed, the unstable alliance would\n> disintegrate in a panic; resistance would crumble.\n>\n> But first Agamemnon's cymeks had to shut down the scrambler shields.\n> Then Salusa would be defenseless and quivering, ready for the main\n> robot fleet to deal the lethal blow, like a huge mechanical boot\n> squashing an insect.\n>\n> The cymek leader jockeyed his dropcarriage into position, ready to\n> lead the second wave with the rest of the extermination fleet.\n> Agamemnon switched off all computerized systems and followed Xerxes\n> down. His brain floated in limbo inside its preservation canister.\n> Blind and deaf, the general did not feel the heat or violent\n> vibrations as his armored craft roared toward the unsuspecting target.\n\n*The intelligent machine is an evil genie, escaped from its bottle.*\n\n--- BARBAROSSA,\n\n*Anatomy of a Rebellion*\n\n> **W**hen Salusa's sensor network detected the arrival of the robotic\n> war fleet, Xavier Harkonnen took action immediately. Once again, the\n> thinking machines meant to test the defenses of free humanity.\n>\n> Though he bore the rank of tercero in the Salusan Militia--- the\n> local, autonomous branch of the overall League Armada--- Xavier had\n> not yet been born during the last real skirmishes against League\n> worlds. The most recent major battle had been nearly a hundred years\n> ago. After all these years, the aggressive machines might be counting\n> on soft human defenses, but Xavier swore they would fail.\n>\n> \"Primero Meach, we've received an urgent warning and a vidstream clip\n> from one of our peripheral scouts,\" he said to his commander. \"But the\n> transmission cut off.\"\n>\n> \"Look at them all!\" squawked Quinto Wilby as he scanned images from\n> the outlying sensor network. The low-ranking officer stood with other\n> soldiers at banks of instrument panels inside a domed building.\n> \"Omnius never sent anything like this before.\"\n>\n> Vannibal Meach, the short but loud-voiced primero of the Salusan\n> Militia, stood in the control center of the planet's defenses, coolly\n> absorbing the flow of information. \"Our last report from the perimeter\n> is hours old due to signal lag. By now they've engaged our pickets,\n> and they'll try to get closer. They'll fail, of course.\" Though this\n> was his first warning of the impending invasion, he reacted as if he\n> had expected the machines to arrive any day.\n>\n> In the control room's illumination, Xavier's dark brown hair glinted\n> with reddish cinnamon highlights. He was a serious young man, prone to\n> honesty and with a tendency to see things in black and white. As a\n> member of the\n>\n> third military ranking tier, Tercero Harkonnen was Meach's backup\n> commander of the local defense outposts. Much admired by his\n> superiors, Xavier had been promoted quickly; equally respected by his\n> soldiers, he was the sort of trusted man they would follow into\n> battle.\n>\n> Despite the sheer size and firepower of the robotic force, he willed\n> himself to calmness, then signaled for reports from the nearest picket\n> ships and put the spaceguard defense fleet on highest alert in close\n> orbit. The warship commanders had already called their crews to\n> battle-ready status as soon as they'd heard the urgent transmission\n> from the now-destroyed scout ships.\n>\n> Around Xavier, automated systems hummed with activity. Listening to\n> the oscillating sirens, the chatter of orders and status reports in\n> the control room, he drew a slow breath, prioritizing tasks. \"We can\n> stop them,\" he said. \"We *will* stop them.\" His voice carried a tone\n> of firm command, as if he were much older than his years and\n> accustomed to battling Omnius every day. In reality, this would be his\n> first engagement with the thinking machines.\n>\n> Years ago, his parents and older brother had been killed in a\n> marrauding cymek attack while en route from an inspection of family\n> holdings on Hagal. The soulless machine forces had always been a\n> threat to the League Worlds, but the humans and Omnius had maintained\n> an uneasy peace for decades.\n>\n> On a wall grid, a map of the Gamma Waiping system showed the orbital\n> locations of Salusa Secundus and six other planets, along with the\n> deployment of sixteen patrol battle groups and the vigilant picket\n> ships that were scattered at random. Cuarto Steff Young hurried to\n> update the tactical projection, plotting her best guess of the\n> location of the approaching robot battle group.\n>\n> \"Contact Segundo Lauderdale, and call in all perimeter warships. Tell\n> them to engage and destroy any enemy they encounter,\" said Primero\n> Meach, then he sighed. \"It'll take half a day at maximum acceleration\n> to retrieve our heavy battle groups from the fringe, but the machines\n> might still be\n>\n> trying to get through by then. Could be a field day for our guys.\"\n> Cuarto Young followed the order with easy efficiency, dispatching a\n> message that would take hours to reach the outskirts of the system.\n>\n> Meach nodded to himself, going through the much-drilled sequence.\n> Always living under the specter of the machines, the Salusan Militia\n> trained regularly for every scenario, as did Armada detachments for\n> every major League system. \"Activate the Holtzman scrambler shields\n> around the planet and issue warnings to all commercial air and space\n> traffic. I want the city's shield transmitter output up to full within\n> ten minutes.\"\n>\n> \"That should be enough to brain-fry any thinking machine\n> gelcircuitry,\" Xavier said with forced confidence. \"We've all seen the\n> tests.\" *This, however, is not just a test*.\n>\n> Once the enemy encountered the defenses the Salusans had installed, he\n> hoped they would calculate their losses to be too heavy, and retreat.\n> Thinking machines didn't like to take risks.\n>\n> He stared at a panel. *But there are so many of them*\n>\n> Then he straightened from his summary screens, full of bad news.\n> \"Primero Meach, if our velocity data for the machine fleet is correct,\n> even at deceleration speed, they are traveling almost as fast as the\n> warning signal we received from our scouts.\"\n>\n> \"Then they could already be here!\" said Quinto Wilby.\n>\n> Now Meach reacted with sharp alarm, triggering a full emergency alert.\n> \"Sound evacuation orders! Open the underground shelters.\"\n>\n> \"Evacuation under way, sir,\" reported Cuarto Young moments later, her\n> fingers working the update panels as she spoke. The intent young woman\n> touched a communication wire at her temple. \"We're sending Viceroy\n> Butler all the information we have.\"\n>\n> *Serena is with him at the Hall of Parliament*, Xavier realized,\n> thinking of the Viceroy's nineteen-year-old daughter. His heart\n> clenched with concern for her, yet he did not dare reveal his fear to\n> his compatriots. Everything in its time and place.\n>\n> In his mind he could see the many threads he needed to weave, doing\n> his part while Primero Meach directed the overall defense.\n>\n> \"Cuarto Chiry, take a squadron and escort Viceroy Butler, his\n> daughter, and all of the League representatives deep into the\n> subterranean shelters.\"\n>\n> \"They should be heading there already, sir,\" the officer said.\n>\n> Xavier gave him a stiff smile. \"Do *you* trust politicians to do the\n> smart thing first?\" The cuarto ran to do as he was told.\n>\n> *Most histories are written by the winners of conflicts, but those\n> written by the losers--- if they survive--- are often more\n> interesting.*\n>\n> --- IBLIS GINJO,\n\n*The Landscape of Humanity*\n\n> **S**alusa Secundus was a green world of temperate climate, home to\n> hundreds of millions of free humans in the League of Nobles. Abundant\n> water flowed through open aqueducts. Around the cultural and\n> governmental center of Zimia, rolling hills were embroidered with\n> vineyards and olive groves.\n>\n> Moments before the machine attack, Serena Butler stepped onto the\n> oratory stage in the great Hall of Parliament. Thanks to her dedicated\n> public service, as well as special arrangements made by her father,\n> she had been granted this opportunity to address the representatives.\n>\n> Viceroy Manion Butler had privately counseled her to be subtle, to\n> keep her points simple. \"One step at a time, dear one. Our League is\n> held together only by the threat of a common enemy, not by a set of\n> shared values or beliefs. Never attack the lifestyles of the nobles.\"\n>\n> This was only the third speech of her brief political career. In her\n> earlier addresses, she had been overly strident--- not yet\n> understanding the ballet of politics--- and her ideas had been met\n> with a mixture of yawns and good-natured chuckles at her na\u00efvet\u00e9. She\n> wanted to end the practice of human slavery that had been adopted\n> sporadically by some League worlds; she wanted to make every human\n> equal, to ensure that all were fed and protected.\n>\n> \"Perhaps the truth hurts. I was trying to make them feel guilty.\" \"You\n> only made them deaf to your words.\"\n>\n> Serena had refined her speech to incorporate his advice, while still\n> sticking to her principles. *One step at a time*. And she, too, would\n> learn with each\n>\n> step. On the advice of her father, she had also spoken to like-minded\n> representatives in private, rallying some support and gaining a few\n> allies ahead of time.\n>\n> Lifting her chin, adjusting her expression to look authoritative\n> rather than eager, Serena positioned herself inside the recording\n> shell that surrounded the podium like a geodesic dome. Her heart\n> swelled with all the good she might be able to do. She felt warm light\n> as the projection mechanism transmitted oversized images of her\n> outside the dome enclosure.\n>\n> A small screen atop the podium allowed her to see herself as they did:\n> a soft face of classical beauty, with hypnotic lavender eyes and\n> amber-brown hair highlighted by natural golden strands. On her left\n> lapel she wore a white rose floweret from her own meticulously tended\n> gardens. The projector made Serena look even more youthful, as the\n> mechanism had been adjusted by nobles to mask the effect of years on\n> their own features.\n>\n> From his gilded box at the front of the audience, round-faced Viceroy\n> Butler, in his finest robes of gold and black, smiled proudly at his\n> daughter. The sigil of the League of Nobles adorned his lapel, an open\n> human hand in gold outline, representing freedom.\n>\n> He understood Serena's optimism, remembering similar ambitions in\n> himself. He had always been patient with her crusades, helping the\n> young woman to rally disaster relief for refugees of machine attacks,\n> letting her journey to other planets to tend to the injured, or dig\n> through rubble and help rebuild burned buildings. Serena had never\n> been afraid to get her hands dirty.\n>\n> \"The narrow mind erects stubborn barriers,\" her mother had once told\n> her. \"But against those barriers, words are formidable weapons.\"\n>\n> On the floor of the great hall, dignitaries chatted in low tones.\n> Several sipped drinks or munched on snacks that had been delivered to\n> their seats. Just another day in Parliament. Comfortable in their\n> villas and mansions, they would not welcome change. But the\n> possibility of bruised egos did not prevent Serena from saying what\n> needed to be said.\n>\n> She activated the oratory projection system. \"Many of you think I have\n> foolish notions because I am young, but perhaps the young have sharper\n> eyesight, while the old grow slowly blind. Am I foolish and na\u00efve---\n> or have some of you, in pampered complacency, distanced yourselves\n> from humanity? Where do you fall on the spectrum of what is right and\n> wrong?\"\n>\n> Out in the assemblage she saw a flurry of indignation mixed with\n> expressions of rude dismissal. Viceroy Butler shot her a sharp glance\n> of disapproval but transmitted a quick reminder throughout the hall,\n> asking for respectful attention, as would be accorded any speaker.\n>\n> She pretended not to notice. Couldn't they all see the larger picture?\n> \"We must each look beyond ourselves if we are to survive as a species.\n> Now is not the time for personal selfishness. For centuries we have\n> confined our defenses to a handful of key planets. Though Omnius has\n> launched no full-scale attack in decades, we live in the constant\n> shadow of the machine threat.\"\n>\n> Touching pressure pads on the podium, Serena displayed a projection of\n> the stellar neighborhood, like a cluster of gems on the high ceiling.\n> With a wand of light, she pointed out the free League Worlds and the\n> Synchronized Worlds ruled by thinking machines. Then she brought her\n> pointer to more extensive regions of the Galaxy where neither\n> organized humans nor machines held sway.\n>\n> \"Look at these poor Unallied Planets: scattered worlds like\n> Harmonthep, Tlulax, Arrakis, IV Anbus, and Caladan. Because their\n> sparse, insular human settlements are not members of our League, they\n> do not warrant our full military protection should they ever be\n> threatened--- by machines or by other humans.\" Serena paused, letting\n> the audience absorb her words. \"Many of our own people wrongly prey on\n> those planets, raiding them for slaves to be supplied to some League\n> Worlds.\"\n>\n> She caught the eye of the Poritrin representative, who scowled,\n> knowing she was talking about him. He responded loudly, interrupting\n> her. \"Slavery is an accepted practice in the League. Lacking complex\n> machines, we have\n>\n> no other choice to augment our workforce.\" He looked smug. \"Besides,\n> Salusa Secundus itself kept a population of Zensunni slaves for almost\n> two centuries.\"\n>\n> \"We put a stop to that practice,\" Serena replied with considerable\n> heat. \"It took some imagination and a willingness to change, but---\"\n>\n> Trying to head off a shouting match, the Viceroy stood. \"Each League\n> planet makes its own determination of local customs, technology, and\n> laws. We have a fearsome enough enemy in the thinking machines without\n> starting a civil war among our own planets.\" His voice sounded\n> paternal, just slightly chiding her to get back to her main point.\n>\n> Sighing but not surrendering, Serena adjusted the pointer so that the\n> Unallied Planets glowed on the ceiling. \"Still, we can't ignore all\n> these worlds--- ripe resource-filled targets, planets just waiting to\n> be conquered by Omnius.\"\n>\n> The Sergeant at Arms, on a tall chair off to one side, rapped his\n> staff on the floor. \"Time.\" Easily bored, he rarely listened to\n> speeches.\n>\n> Serena continued in a rush, trying to finish her point without\n> sounding strident. \"We know the thinking machines want to control the\n> Galaxy, even though they have been essentially quiescent for almost a\n> hundred years. They have systematically taken over every world in the\n> Synchronized star systems. Do not be lulled by their seeming lack of\n> interest in us. We know they will strike again--- but how, and where?\n> Should we not move before Omnius does?\"\n>\n> \"What is it you *want*, Madame Butler?\" one of the dignitaries\n> inquired impatiently, raising his voice, but not standing, as was\n> customary. \"Are you advocating some sort of preemptive strike against\n> the thinking machines?\"\n>\n> \"We must seek to incorporate the Unallied Planets into the League, and\n> stop harvesting them for slaves.\" She jabbed her illuminated wand at\n> the overhead projection. \"Bring them under our wing to increase our\n> own strength, and theirs. We would all benefit! I propose that we\n> dispatch\n>\n> ambassadors and cultural attach\u00e9s with the express intent of forming\n> new military and political alliances. As many as we can.\"\n>\n> \"And who will pay for all that diplomacy?\" \"Time,\" the Sergeant at\n> Arms repeated.\n>\n> \"She is allotted three extra minutes for rebuttal, since the\n> representative from Hagal has posed a question,\" Viceroy Butler said\n> in an authoritative tone.\n>\n> Serena grew angry. How could that representative worry about petty\n> price tags, when the ultimate cost was so much higher? \"We will all\n> pay--- in blood--- if we do not do this. We must strengthen the League\n> and the human species.\"\n>\n> Some of the nobles began to clap--- the allies she had courted before\n> her speech. Suddenly, screeching alarms echoed through the building\n> and in the streets. Droning sirens wavered in a chillingly familiar\n> tone--- usually heard only during planned drills--- summoning all\n> reserve members of the Salusan Militia.\n>\n> \"Thinking machines have entered the Salusan system,\" a voice said\n> through built-in speakers. Similar announcements would be ringing all\n> across Zimia. \"We have an alert from perimeter scouts and the sentry\n> battle group.\"\n>\n> Standing next to her father, Serena read details as the Viceroy was\n> handed a brief and urgent summary. \"We've never seen a robot war fleet\n> that size!\" he said. \"How long ago did the first scouts sound the\n> warning? How much time do we have?\"\n>\n> \"We are under attack!\" a man shouted. The delegates were on their\n> feet, scattering like stirred ants.\n>\n> \"Prepare to evacuate the Hall of Parliament.\" The Sergeant at Arms\n> became a flurry of movement. \"All armored shelters are open.\n> Representatives, report to your designated areas.\"\n>\n> Viceroy Butler shouted into the chaos, trying to sound confident. \"The\n> Holtzman shields will protect us!\" Serena could read her father's\n> anxiety, though he covered it well.\n>\n> Amid shouts and cries of panic, the League representatives scrambled\n> for the exits. The merciless enemies of humanity had arrived.\n>\n> *Any man who asks for greater authority does not deserve to have it.*\n>\n> --- TERCERO XAVIER HARKONNEN, address to Salusan Militia\n>\n> **\"T**he robot fleet has just engaged our spaceguard,\" Xavier\n> Harkonnen called from his station. \"Heavy fire exchanged.\"\n>\n> \"Primero Meach!\" Cuarto Steff Young shouted from the orbital grid\n> screens. Xavier could smell the salty metallic tang of Young's nervous\n> sweat. \"Sir, a small detachment of machine ships has broken from the\n> main robotic fleet in orbit. Configuration unknown, but they're\n> preparing for an atmospheric descent.\" She pointed to the images,\n> picking out brilliant lights that signified a cluster of inert\n> projectiles.\n>\n> Xavier glanced at the perimeter scanners, real-time intelligence\n> transmitted from the defensive satellites high above Tio Holtzman's\n> gelcircuitry-scrambling fields. On the highest resolution he saw an\n> assault squadron of pyramidal ships roaring headlong into the\n> atmosphere, straight toward the sizzling shields.\n>\n> \"They're in for an unpleasant surprise,\" Young said with a grim smile.\n> \"No thinking machine can survive that ride.\"\n>\n> \"Our biggest worry will be dodging the debris from their crashing\n> ships,\" Primero Meach quipped. \"Maintain surveillance.\"\n>\n> But the dropcarriages slipped past the scrambler shields--- and kept\n> coming.\n>\n> They showed no electronic signatures at all as they penetrated the\n> boundary.\n>\n> \"How are they getting through?\" Quinto Wilby mopped his brow, brushing\n> dishwater-brown hair out of his eyes.\n>\n> \"No computers could.\" In a flash, Xavier understood what was\n> happening. \"They're blind dropcarriages, sir!\"\n>\n> Young looked up from her screens, breathing hard. \"Impact in less than\n> a minute, Primero. Second wave is coming in behind them. I count\n> twenty-eight projectiles.\" She shook her head. \"No computer signatures\n> on any of them.\"\n>\n> Xavier called out, thinking ahead, \"Rico, Powder, work with\n> med-response teams and fire-suppression squads. Everything up to speed\n> and *ready*. Come on people, we've drilled for this a hundred times! I\n> want all vehicles and rescue equipment mobile and in the air, prepared\n> to move before the first ship hits.\"\n>\n> \"Divert defenses to pound the invaders as soon as they crash.\" Primero\n> Meach lowered his voice, swept his flinty gaze across his comrades.\n> \"Tercero Harkonnen, take a portable comstation and get out there--- be\n> my eyes on the scene. My guess is those dropcarriages will hatch into\n> something unpleasant.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> OUTSIDE, THE CITY streets were chaotic under a cloud-dappled sky.\n> Rushing into the confusion, Xavier heard the hot metallic scream of\n> agonized atmosphere as the inert armored projectiles shot downward\n> like bullets from space.\n>\n> An asteroid-rain of pyramidal dropcarriages slammed into the ground,\n> one after another. With deafening thunder, the first four blind\n> vessels punched into buildings, leveling city blocks with the\n> explosive dispersion of kinetic energy. But sophisticated\n> shock-displacement systems protected the deadly cargo inside.\n>\n> Xavier ran down the street, his uniform rumpled, his sweaty hair\n> clinging to his head. He stopped in front of the giant edifice of the\n> Hall of Parliament. Although second in command of Salusa's defenses,\n> here he was in an unsecured position, ready to issue orders at ground\n> zero. Not exactly the way he had been taught in his Armada Academy\n> courses. But Primero Meach was relying on his assessment,\n> recommendations, and ability to act independently.\n>\n> He touched the comline on his chin. \"I'm in position, sir.\"\n>\n> Five more unguided projectiles thumped into the outskirts of the city,\n> leaving smoldering craters. Explosions. Smoke. Fireballs.\n>\n> From the impact points, the inert crashdown pods cracked open to\n> reveal a huge object stirring in each one. Reactivated mechanical\n> units peeled off charred ablation shielding. With dread, Xavier knew\n> what he was about to see, understood how the enemy machines had\n> managed to pass through the scrambler shields. They were not computer\n> minds at all. . . .\n>\n> *Cymeks*.\n>\n> Fearsome mechanical monstrosities emerged from the broken pyramids,\n> driven by surgically detached human brains. Mobility systems\n> restarted; articulated legs and augmented weapons clicked into place.\n>\n> The cymek bodies lurched out of the smoking craters, crablike\n> gladiators half as tall as the damaged buildings. Their alloy legs\n> were as thick as support girders, bristling with flamer cannons,\n> artillery launchers, poison gas jets.\n>\n> Xavier shouted into his comline. \"Cymek warrior-forms, Primero Meach!\n> They figured out how to get through our orbital defenses!\"\n>\n> All across Salusa, from the outskirts of Zimia to the farthest\n> continent, the local planetary militia was dispatched. Low-atmospheric\n> defense craft--- kindjals--- had already launched in defensive\n> overflights, their weaponry magazines loaded with armor-piercing\n> projectile shells.\n>\n> People in the streets fled in terror; others stood frozen, staring.\n> Xavier shouted descriptions of what he was seeing. He heard Vannibal\n> Meach add, \"Cuarto Young, issue orders for all stations to break out\n> the breathing apparatus. See that filter masks are distributed to the\n> populace. Every person not inside an approved shelter must wear a\n> breather.\"\n>\n> Face masks wouldn't protect against cymek flamers or high-energy\n> detonations, but the people could be safe from the thick poison\n> clouds. As he fit his own breather into place, Xavier felt a growing\n> fear that all of the Militia's best-planned precautions would be\n> woefully inadequate.\n>\n> Leaving the discarded shells of their dropcarriages behind, cymek\n> warriors thrummed forward on monstrous feet. They launched explosive\n> shells and incinerated buildings and screaming people. Gouts of flame\n> poured from nozzles in their foremost limbs, setting the city of Zimia\n> on fire.\n>\n> Dropcarriages continued to tumble from above, ready to split open as\n> soon as they crashed. Twenty-eight of them in all.\n>\n> With a howling roar loud enough to burn his ears, the young tercero\n> saw a column of fire and smoke spinning, tumbling, so fast and bright\n> that it left his retinas smoldering. The dropcarriage smashed into the\n> military compound half a kilometer behind him, vaporizing the control\n> center and the planetary Militia HQ building. The shockwave knocked\n> Xavier to his knees, shattered windows for dozens of blocks.\n>\n> \"Primero!\" Xavier screamed into the comline. \"Primero Meach! Command\n> center! Anybody!\"\n>\n> But he could see from the ruins that he would get no response from the\n> Militia commander or any of his comrades in the complex.\n>\n> Stalking through the streets, the cymeks spewed greenish black smoke,\n> an oily mist that settled into a toxic film covering the ground and\n> structures. Then the first squadron of kindjal bombers came in low.\n> Their initial sweep scattered explosives around the machine warriors,\n> striking both cymeks and buildings.\n>\n> Wearing his clearplaz breathing mask, Xavier panted, unable to believe\n> what he had just seen. He called again for the commander, but received\n> no response. Finally, tactical substations around the city checked in,\n> demanding to know what had happened, asking him to identify himself.\n>\n> \"This is Tercero Xavier Harkonnen,\" he said. Then full understanding\n> hit him. With a supreme effort, he summoned his courage and steadied\n> his voice. \"I am . . . I am currently in command of the Salusan\n> Militia.\"\n>\n> He ran toward the conflagration, into the billowing greasy smoke. All\n> around him civilians fell to their knees retching in the poisonous\n> mist. He glared up at the aerial strikes, wishing he could be in more\n> direct control. \"The cymeks can be destroyed,\" he transmitted to the\n> kindjal pilots. Then he coughed. The mask was not working properly.\n> His chest and throat burned as if he had inhaled acid, but he kept\n> shouting orders.\n>\n> As the attack proceeded, Salusan emergency response aircraft swooped\n> over the battle zone, dumping canisters of fire-suppression powders\n> and foams. At ground level, masked medical squadrons moved in without\n> hesitation.\n>\n> Oblivious to the insignificant human defense efforts, the cymeks\n> marched forward, moving as individuals, not an army--- mechanical mad\n> dogs spreading mayhem. A warrior-form bent back on powerful crablike\n> legs and blasted two rescue ships out of the sky--- then it moved\n> ahead again, eerily graceful.\n>\n> The front line of Salusan bombers dropped explosive shells directly\n> onto one of the first cymeks. Two projectiles struck the armored body,\n> and a third hit a nearby building, causing the structure to collapse,\n> girders and debris tumbling down to bury the invader's mechanical\n> body.\n>\n> But after the flames and smoke cleared, the battered cymek remained\n> functional. The murderous machine shook itself free of the rubble,\n> then launched a counterattack at the kindjals overhead.\n>\n> From his distant vantage, Xavier studied their movements, using a\n> portable tactical grid. He needed to figure out the overarching plan\n> of the thinking machines. The cymeks seemed to have a target in mind.\n>\n> He could not hesitate or waste time bemoaning the fall of his\n> comrades. He could not ask what Primero Meach would have done.\n> Instead, he had to stay\n>\n> clear-headed and make some immediate decisions. If he could only\n> understand the enemies' objective . . .\n>\n> In orbit, the robotic fleet continued to fire upon the Salusan\n> spaceguard, though the AI enemy could not pass through Holtzman\n> fields. They might defeat the spaceguard ships and blockade the League\n> capital world . . . but Primero Meach had already recalled the heavy\n> perimeter battle groups, and soon all that League Armada firepower\n> would pose a serious challenge to the robot warships.\n>\n> On the screen he saw the robot fleet maintaining position . . . as if\n> waiting for some signal from the cymek shock troops. His mind whirled.\n> What were they doing?\n>\n> A trio of gladiator machines launched explosives against the west wing\n> of the Hall of Parliament. The beautifully carved facade sloughed to\n> the street like a late-spring avalanche. Slabs of rubble crumbled,\n> exposing open chambers in the evacuated governmental offices.\n>\n> Coughing in the smoke, trying to see through his smeared faceplate,\n> Xavier looked into the eyes of a white-smocked medic who grabbed him\n> and fitted a new mask over his face. Xavier's lungs burned more now,\n> as if they had been soaked in av-fuel and lit on fire.\n>\n> \"You'll be fine,\" the medic promised in an uncertain tone as he\n> applied a snap-injection pack to Xavier's neck.\n>\n> \"I'd better be.\" The tercero coughed again and saw black spots in\n> front of his eyes. \"I don't have time to be a casualty right now.\"\n>\n> Xavier thought beyond himself and felt a deep worry for Serena. Less\n> than an hour ago, she had been scheduled to speak to the League\n> representatives. He prayed that she had reached safety.\n>\n> Struggling to his feet, he waved the medic away as the injection took\n> effect. He tuned his portable tactical grid and requested a sky-high\n> view, imaged\n>\n> from the fast defense kindjals. He studied the blackened paths of the\n> graceful, titanic cymeks on his screen. *Where are they going?*\n>\n> Mentally, he scanned from the smoldering impact craters and the ruins\n> of the Militia HQ, envisioning the paths made by the mechanical\n> monsters as they pressed forward.\n>\n> Then he understood what he should have seen from the start, and cursed\n> under his breath.\n>\n> Omnius knew the Holtzman scrambler shields would obliterate thinking\n> machine gelcircuitry; thus the main robotic fleet remained just beyond\n> Salusan orbit. If the cymeks took out the shield generators, though,\n> the planet would be wide open to a full-scale invasion.\n>\n> Xavier faced a critical decision, but his choice was predetermined.\n> Whether he liked it or not, he was in command now. By wiping out\n> Primero Meach and the Militia command structure, the cymeks had put\n> him temporarily in charge. And he knew what he had to do.\n>\n> He ordered the Salusan Militia to fall back and direct their utmost\n> efforts to defend the single most vital target, leaving the rest of\n> Zimia exposed as the cymeks blasted and burned everywhere. Even if he\n> had to sacrifice part of this important city, he must stop the machine\n> forces from reaching their target.\n>\n> At all costs.\n>\n> *Is the subject or the observer the greater influence?*\n\n--- ERASMUS,\n\nuncollated laboratory files\n\n> **O**n Corrin, one of the primary Synchronized Worlds, the robot\n> Erasmus walked across the flagstone plaza that fronted his lavish\n> villa. He moved with a well-practiced fluidity that he had learned to\n> imitate after centuries of observing human grace. His flowmetal face\n> was a burnished blank oval, like a mirror entirely devoid of\n> expression until he decided to form the metallic polymer film into a\n> range of mimicked emotions, like ancient theater masks.\n>\n> Through optic threads implanted in his facial membrane, he admired the\n> iridescent fountains around him, which so nicely complemented the\n> villa's stonework, gemstone statuary, intricate tapestries, and\n> laser-etched alabaster columns. All plush and opulent, by his own\n> design. After much study and analysis, he had learned to appreciate\n> standards of classical beauty, and was proud of his evident taste.\n>\n> His pet human slaves bustled about performing household chores---\n> polishing trophies and art objects, dusting furniture, planting\n> flowers, trimming topiary shrubs under the crimson afternoon light of\n> the red-giant sun. Each tremulous slave bowed in respect as Erasmus\n> passed. He recognized but did not bother to identify individuals,\n> though he mentally filed every detail. One never knew when the tiniest\n> scrap of data might help in overall understanding.\n>\n> Erasmus had a skin of organic-plastic composites laced with\n> neurelectronics. He pretended that the sophisticated sensor network\n> allowed him to genuinely feel physical sensations. Under the glowing\n> ember of Corrin's huge sun, he detected light and warmth on his skin,\n> presumably like real flesh. He wore a thick gold robe trimmed in\n> carmine, part of a stylish personal wardrobe that separated him from\n> Omnius's lesser robots.\n>\n> Vanity was another thing Erasmus had learned from studying humans, and\n> he rather enjoyed it.\n>\n> Most robots were not as independent as Erasmus. They were little more\n> than mobile thinking boxes, drone subsets of the evermind. Erasmus\n> obeyed Omnius's commands as well, but he had more freedom to\n> interpret. Over the centuries, he had developed his own identity and\n> semblance of an ego. Omnius considered him something of a curiosity.\n>\n> As the robot continued to walk with perfect grace, he detected a\n> buzzing sound. His optic threads picked up a small flying orb, one of\n> Omnius's many mobile watcheyes. Whenever Erasmus ventured away from\n> the ubiquitous screens found throughout all buildings, the avid\n> watcheyes followed him, recording his every move. The evermind's\n> actions spoke of either a deep-seated curiosity . . . or an oddly\n> humanlike paranoia.\n>\n> Long ago, while tinkering with the original AI computers of the Old\n> Empire, the rebel Barbarossa had added approximations of certain\n> personality traits and goals. Subsequently the machines had\n> self-evolved into a single grand electronic mind that retained a few\n> of the imposed human ambitions and characteristics.\n>\n> As far as Omnius was concerned, biologicals, even bastardized cymeks\n> with human brains and machine parts, could not see the epoch-spanning\n> vistas that the gelcircuitry of a machine mind could encompass. When\n> Omnius scanned the universe of possibilities it was like a vast\n> screen. There were so many ways to win, and he was constantly on the\n> alert for them.\n>\n> Omnius's core programming had been duplicated on all the\n> machine-conquered planets and synchronized through the use of regular\n> updates. Faceless, able to watch and communicate throughout the\n> interstellar network, near-identical copies of Omnius were everywhere,\n> vicariously present in innumerable watcheyes, appliances, and contact\n> screens.\n>\n> Now, apparently, the distributed computer mind had nothing better to\n> do than snoop. \"Where are you going, Erasmus?\" Omnius demanded from a\n> tiny speaker beneath the watcheye. \"Why are you walking so fast?\"\n>\n> \"You could walk, too, if you chose to do so. Why not give yourself\n> legs for a while and wear an artificial body, just to see what it is\n> like?\" Erasmus's metallic polymer mask reshaped itself into a smile.\n> \"We could go for a stroll together.\"\n>\n> The watcheye buzzed along beside Erasmus. Corrin had long seasons,\n> because its orbit was so far around the giant sun. Winters and summers\n> each lasted for thousands of days. The rugged landscape had no\n> indigenous forests or wildernesses, only a handful of ancient orchards\n> and agricultural fields that had gone to seed since the machine\n> takeover, left to propogate untended.\n>\n> Many human slaves went blind from exposure to the pounding solar flux.\n> As a consequence, Erasmus fitted his outdoor workers with custom eye\n> protection. He was a benevolent master, concerned for the well-being\n> of his resources.\n>\n> As he reached the entry gate of his villa, the robot adjusted the new\n> sensory-enhancement module grafted by neurelectronic ports onto his\n> body core and hidden beneath his robe. A unit of his own design, the\n> module allowed Erasmus to simulate the senses of humanity, but with\n> certain unavoidable limitations. He wanted to know more than the\n> module could provide, wanted to *feel* more. In this respect, the\n> cymeks might have an advantage over Erasmus, but he would never know\n> for certain.\n>\n> Cymeks--- especially the original Titans--- were a narrow-minded,\n> brutal bunch, with no appreciation for the more refined senses and\n> sensibilities that Erasmus worked so hard to attain. Brutality had its\n> place, of course, but the sophisticated robot considered it only one\n> of many behaviorial aspects worthy of study, both positive and\n> negative. Still, violence was interesting and often pleasurable to\n> employ. . . .\n>\n> He was intensely curious about what made cognizant biologicals\n> *human*. He was intelligent and self-aware, but he also wanted to\n> understand emotions, human sensibilities, and motivations--- the\n> essential details that machines never managed to reproduce very well.\n>\n> During his centuries-long quest, Erasmus had absorbed human artwork,\n> music, philosophy, and literature. Ultimately, he wanted to discover\n> the sum and substance of humanity, the magic spark that made these\n> creatures, these *creators*, different. What gave them . . . souls?\n>\n> He marched into his banquet hall, and the flying eye buzzed away\n> toward the ceiling, where it could observe everything. On the walls,\n> six Omnius screens glowed milky gray.\n>\n> His villa was modeled after the opulent Greco-Roman estates in which\n> the Twenty Titans had lived before forsaking their human bodies.\n> Erasmus owned similar villas on five planets, including Corrin and\n> Earth. He maintained additional facilities--- holding pens, customized\n> vivisection rooms, medical laboratories, as well as greenhouses, art\n> galleries, sculptures, and fountains. All of which enabled him to\n> study human behavior and physiology.\n>\n> Erasmus sat his robed body at the head of a long table lined with\n> silver goblets and candleholders, but with only one place setting. For\n> him. The antique wooden chair had once belonged to a human nobleman,\n> Nivny O'Mura, a founder of the League of Nobles. Erasmus had studied\n> how the rebellious humans had organized themselves and established\n> strongholds against the early cymek and machine assaults. The\n> resourceful *hrethgir* had ways of adapting and improvising, of\n> confounding their enemies in unexpected ways. *Fascinating*.\n>\n> Abruptly, the evermind's voice echoed from all around, sounding bored.\n> \"When will your experiment be concluded, Erasmus? You come in here day\n> after day, doing the same thing. I expect to see results.\"\n>\n> \"I am intrigued by questions. Why do wealthy humans eat with such\n> ceremony? Why do they consider certain foods and beverages superior to\n> others, when the nutritional value is the same?\" The robot's voice\n> became more erudite. \"The answer, Omnius, has to do with their\n> brutally short lives. They compensate with efficient sensory\n> mechanisms capable of imparting intense feelings. Humans have five\n> basic senses, with countless gradations.\n>\n> The taste of Yondair beer versus Ularda wine, for example. Or the feel\n> of Ecaz burlap compared with parasilk, or the music of Brahms\n> versus---\"\n>\n> \"I suppose that is all very interesting in some esoteric way.\"\n>\n> \"Of course, Omnius. You continue to study me while I study humans.\"\n> Erasmus signaled the slaves who peered nervously through a porthole in\n> the door to the villa's kitchen. A probe snaked out of a module at\n> Erasmus's hip and emerged from underneath his robe, waving delicate\n> neurelectronic sensor threads like expectant cobras.\n>\n> \"By tolerating your investigations, Erasmus, I expect that you will\n> develop a detailed model that can reliably predict human behavior. I\n> must know how to make these creatures *usable*.\"\n>\n> White-clad slaves brought trays of food from the kitchen--- Corrin\n> game hen, Walgis beef almondine, even rare Platinum River salmon\n> harvested from Parmentier. Erasmus dipped the weblike ends of his\n> probe into each dish and \"tasted\" it, sometimes using a cutter to\n> penetrate the meat and sample the internal juices. Erasmus documented\n> each flavor for his growing repertoire.\n>\n> All the while, he carried on a dialogue with Omnius. The evermind\n> seemed to be doling out bits of data and watching how Erasmus reacted.\n> \"I have been building up my military forces. After many years, it is\n> time to move again.\"\n>\n> \"Indeed? Or are the Titans pressuring you into a more aggressive\n> stance? For centuries, Agamemnon has been impatient with what he\n> perceives as your lack of ambition.\" Erasmus was more interested in\n> the bitter berry tart in front of him. Analyzing the ingredients, he\n> was puzzled to detect a strong trace of human saliva and wondered if\n> that had been part of the original recipe. Or had one of the slaves\n> simply expectorated into it?\n>\n> \"I make my own decisions,\" the evermind said. \"It seemed appropriate\n> to launch a new offensive at this time.\"\n>\n> The head chef rolled a cart to the table and used a carving knife to\n> cut a slab of Filet Salusa. The chef, a toady little man who\n> stuttered, placed the dripping slice on a clean plate, added a dollop\n> of savory brown sauce, and extended it toward Erasmus. Clumsily, the\n> chef bumped the knife off the serving tray and it clattered against\n> one of Erasmus's smooth feet, leaving a nick and a stain.\n>\n> Terrified, the man bent to retrieve the knife, but Erasmus flashed a\n> mechanical hand down and grabbed the handle. Sitting straight, the\n> elegant robot continued to talk to Omnius. \"A new offensive? And is it\n> a mere coincidence that the Titan Barbarossa requested exactly that as\n> a reward when he defeated your fighting machine in the gladiator\n> arena?\"\n>\n> \"Irrelevant.\"\n>\n> Staring at the blade, the chef stammered, \"I will p-personally\n> p-polish it and m-m-make it good as n-n-new, Lord Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \"Humans are such fools, Erasmus,\" Omnius said from speakers on the\n> wall.\n>\n> \"Some of them are,\" Erasmus agreed, waving the carving knife with\n> graceful movements. The little chef mouthed a silent prayer, unable to\n> move. \"I wonder what should I do?\" Erasmus wiped the knife clean on\n> the trembling man's smock, then stared at the fellow's distorted\n> reflection in the metal blade.\n>\n> \"Human death is different from machine death,\" Omnius said\n> dispassionately. \"A machine can be duplicated, backed-up. When humans\n> die, they are gone permanently.\"\n>\n> Erasmus simulated a boisterous laugh. \"Omnius, though you always talk\n> about the superiority of machines, you fail to recognize what humans\n> do better than we.\"\n>\n> \"Do not give me another of your lists,\" the evermind said. \"I recall\n> our last debate on this subject with perfect accuracy.\"\n>\n> \"Superiority is in the eye of the beholder and invariably involves\n> filtering out details that do not conform to a particular preconceived\n> notion.\" With his sensory detectors waving like cilia in the air,\n> Erasmus smelled the odor of foul sweat from the chef.\n>\n> \"Are you going to kill this one?\" Omnius asked.\n>\n> Erasmus placed the knife on the table and heard the toady man emit a\n> sigh. \"Individually, humans are easy to kill. But as a species, the\n> challenge is far greater. When threatened, they draw together and\n> become more powerful, more dangerous. Sometimes it is best to surprise\n> them.\"\n>\n> Without warning, he grabbed the knife and plunged it into the chef's\n> chest with enough force to drive it through the sternum and into the\n> heart. \"Like so.\" Blood spurted down the white uniform, onto the table\n> and the robot's plate.\n>\n> The hapless human slid off the blade, gurgling. As Erasmus held the\n> bloody knife he considered attempting to duplicate his victim's look\n> of disbelief and betrayal with his own pliable mask, but decided not\n> to bother. His robot face remained a flat, mirrored oval.

AUGUSTINE,\n\nancient Earth philosopher\n\n> **T**hough the cymeks had only begun their assault on Zimia, Xavier\n> Harkonnen knew that free humanity must make its stand, here and now.\n> And make it count.\n>\n> The weapon-studded warrior-forms strode forward in lockstep. Raising\n> silver arms, they launched explosive projectiles, spewed gouts of\n> flame, spread poison gas. With each smashed wall, the cymeks drew\n> closer to the main shield-generator station, a soaring tower of\n> parabolic curves and intricate latticework.\n>\n> At the fringes of Salusa's atmosphere, an orbital array of redundant\n> satellites wove a crackling fence with amplifiers at each node. Across\n> the continents, transmission towers beamed up the substance of the\n> Holtzman scrambler field, crisscrossing it into an intricate mesh high\n> above the planet, an impenetrable tapestry of energy.\n>\n> But if the cymeks took out the primary towers on the surface,\n> vulnerable gaps would open in the shield. The whole protective fabric\n> could unravel.\n>\n> Coughing blood from his searing throat and lungs, Xavier shouted into\n> his comline, \"This is Tercero Harkonnen, assuming command of local\n> forces. Primero Meach and the control center have been wiped out.\" The\n> channel remained silent for several long seconds, as if the entire\n> Militia had been stunned.\n>\n> Swallowing hard, Xavier tasted rusty blood in his mouth, then he\n> issued his terrible order: \"All local forces, form a cordon around the\n> shield-transmitting towers. We do not have the resources to defend the\n> rest of the\n>\n> city. Repeat, *pull back*. This includes all combat vehicles and\n> attack aircraft.\"\n>\n> The expected complaints poured in. \"Sir, you can't be serious! The\n> city is burning!\"\n>\n> \"Zimia will be undefended! This must be a mistake!\"\n>\n> \"Sir, please reconsider! Have you seen the damage those cymek bastards\n> are already causing? Think of our people!\"\n>\n> \"I don't recognize the authority of a *tercero* to issue orders of\n> such---\"\n>\n> Xavier countermanded all of them. \"The cymek objective is obvious:\n> they intend to bring down our scrambler fields so the robot fleet can\n> destroy us. We must defend the towers at all costs. *At all costs*.\"\n>\n> Blatantly ignoring his order, a dozen pilots flew kindjals overhead,\n> continuing to dump explosives upon the cymek walkers.\n>\n> Xavier growled in an uncompromising voice, \"Anybody who wants to argue\n> about it can do so afterward--- at your court-martial.\"*Or mine*, he\n> thought.\n>\n> Droplets of scarlet splashed the inside of his plaz mask, and he\n> wondered how much damage the poisonous fumes had already done. Each\n> breath became difficult, but he put such concerns out of his mind. He\n> could not sound weak, not now. \"All assets, pull back and protect the\n> towers! That is an order. We need to regroup and change our strategy.\"\n>\n> Finally, Salusan ground units retreated from their pitched defenses,\n> drawing back toward the shield-transmitter complex. The rest of the\n> city lay as vulnerable as a lamb prepared for slaughter. And the\n> cymeks took advantage with gleeful mayhem.\n>\n> Four warrior-forms crashed through a statue park and destroyed\n> fabulous works. The mechanical monsters annihilated buildings,\n> blasting and\n>\n> burning museums, dwelling complexes, hazard shelters. Any target\n> suited them.\n>\n> \"Stand firm,\" Xavier commanded on all channels, overruling howls of\n> outrage from the troops. \"The cymeks are trying to lure us away.\"\n>\n> The warrior-forms set fire to a resonant bell tower erected by Chusuk\n> to commemorate a successful defense against the thinking machines,\n> four centuries ago. The ornate bells clanged and gonged as the tower\n> collapsed onto the paving stones of an open gathering square.\n>\n> By now most of Zimia's populace had rushed to armored shelters. Fleets\n> of medical and fire-suppression craft dodged enemy blasts to fight the\n> increasing disaster. Many rescue attempts became suicide missions.\n>\n> In the midst of the Militia crowded around the transmitting towers,\n> Xavier felt a flash of doubt, wondering if he had made the right\n> decision but not daring to change his mind now. His eyes stung from\n> smoke, and his shredded lungs sent shocks of agony through his body\n> each time he drew a breath. He knew he was right. He was fighting for\n> the lives of everyone on the planet. Including Serena Butler's.\n>\n> \"Now what, Tercero?\" said Cuarto Jaymes Powder, coming up behind him.\n> Though the subcommander's angular face was partially covered in a\n> mask, his eyes still revealed his outrage. \"Do we just sit back and\n> watch these bastards level Zimia? What good is it to protect the\n> shield transmitters if there's nothing left of the city?\"\n>\n> \"We can't save the city if we lose our shields and open up the whole\n> planet to machine attack,\" Xavier rasped.\n>\n> The Salusan troops mounted a defense around the parabolic lattice-work\n> of transmitting towers. Ground forces and armored equipment were\n> arrayed on the surrounding ramparts and streets. Kindjals circled the\n> skies and fired their weapons, keeping the cymeks away.\n>\n> Gripping their weapons, the nearest Militia members seethed. The\n> frustrated men wanted to rush forward and engage the attackers . . .\n> or perhaps tear Xavier limb from limb. With each explosion or leveled\n> building, the angry troops edged one step closer to outright mutiny.\n>\n> \"Until reinforcements arrive, we'll need to concentrate our forces,\"\n> Xavier said, coughing.\n>\n> Powder stared at the tercero's plaz faceplate, noticed blood on the\n> inside. \"Sir, are you all right?\"\n>\n> \"It's nothing.\" But Xavier heard the liquid wheezing of his mangled\n> lungs with every breath he took.\n>\n> Feeling unsteady as the poison continued to burn his soft tissues, he\n> gripped a plascrete bulwark for support. He studied the last stand he\n> had assembled on short notice and hoped it would hold. Finally, Xavier\n> said, \"Now that these towers are held and protected, we can go out and\n> hunt down some of our attackers. Are you ready, Cuarto Powder?\"\n>\n> Powder brightened, and soldiers cheered. Several men fired their\n> weapons into the air, ready to charge pell-mell into the destruction.\n> Like a rider at the reins of a willful horse, Xavier held them back.\n>\n> \"Wait! Pay close attention. There is no clever trick we can use, no\n> inherent weakness that will allow us to outsmart the cymeks. But we\n> have the will to succeed and the need to succeed . . . or we will lose\n> everything.\" Ignoring the blood in his mask, he didn't know how he was\n> able to summon unwavering confidence in his voice. \"*This* is how we\n> will beat them.\"\n>\n> During the initial frantic skirmishes, Xavier had seen at least one of\n> the gargantuan invaders destroyed by multiple, concentrated\n> explosions. Its articulated body was now nothing more than a smoking\n> hulk. However, the scattered bombers and armored ground units had\n> spread their attacks across too many targets, diluting their efforts.\n>\n> \"This will be a coordinated strike. We will select a single target and\n> crush it, one cymek at a time. We'll hit it and hit it again until\n> there's nothing left. Then we'll go on to the next one.\"\n>\n> Though he could barely breathe, Xavier chose to lead the squadrons\n> himself. As a tercero, he was accustomed to being in the thick of the\n> action during training exercises and simulations.\n>\n> \"Sir?\" Powder said, surprised. \"Shouldn't you be in a secure area? As\n> the acting commander, standard procedure requires---\"\n>\n> \"You're absolutely right, Jaymes,\" he said quietly. \"Nevertheless, I'm\n> going up there. We're in an all-or-nothing situation. You stay here\n> and protect those towers at all costs.\"\n>\n> Subterranean elevators brought more kindjals to the surface, ready for\n> launch. He climbed into one of the mottled gray craft and sealed\n> himself into the cockpit. Troopers raced to their assault ships,\n> shouting promises of revenge to their comrades who were forced to\n> remain behind. As he transferred the kindjal's comchannel to his\n> command frequency, Xavier issued new instructions.\n>\n> Tercero Harkonnen adjusted the cockpit seat and launched his kindjal.\n> The rush of acceleration pushed him backward and made his breathing\n> even more difficult. Hot blood trickled from one corner of his mouth.\n>\n> Soaring away from the central transmitting towers, aircraft followed\n> him, while a small number of armored ground vehicles moved away from\n> the generating facility, heading for their designated intercept\n> positions. Weapons primed and bombs ready to drop, the kindjals\n> descended toward the first cymek target, one of the smaller machines.\n> Xavier's voice crackled in the cockpit of every aircraft. \"On my mark,\n> strike---*now*.\"\n>\n> The defenders pounded the crablike body from all directions until the\n> warrior-form lay crushed, its articulated legs blackened and twisted,\n> the brain canister destroyed. Cheers and catcalls resonated across the\n>\n> comchannels. Before the cymeks could react to the new coordinated\n> tactic, Xavier chose a second target. \"Follow me. Next one.\"\n>\n> The Militia squadron came in like a hammer, converging on a single\n> mechanical body. Mobile armored ground units opened fire from the\n> surface, while kindjals dropped powerful bombs from above.\n>\n> The second cymek target saw the attack coming and raised its spiked\n> metal legs to open fire with white-hot sprays of flame. Two of\n> Xavier's flanking kindjals went down, crashing into already-ruined\n> buildings. Stray bombs leveled a square block of the city.\n>\n> But the remainder of the concentrated assault struck true. The\n> multiple explosions were more than the robotic body could withstand,\n> and another cymek was battered into wreckage. One of its metal arms\n> twitched, then fell out of its socket into the rubble.\n>\n> \"Three down,\" Xavier said. \"Twenty-five more.\" \"Unless they retreat\n> first,\" said another pilot.\n>\n> The cymeks were individuals, unlike most of Omnius's thinking\n> machines. Some of them were survivors of the original Titans;\n> others--- the neo-cymeks--- came from traitorous human collaborators\n> on the Synchronized Worlds. All had sacrificed their physical bodies\n> so they could be closer to the supposed perfection of thinking\n> machines.\n>\n> Among the troops surrounding the field-transmission towers, Cuarto\n> Powder used everything in his combined arsenals to drive back four\n> cymeks that had gotten close enough to threaten the vital structures.\n> He destroyed one warrior-form and forced the other three to limp away\n> and regroup. Meanwhile, Xavier's forces in the air crushed two more\n> cymeks.\n>\n> The tide was turning.\n>\n> Xavier's bomb-laden kindjals came around again, closing on a new wave\n> of invaders. Followed by armored ground vehicles and artillery guns,\n> the\n>\n> Salusan Militia launched volley after volley at the foremost cymek.\n> The bombardment damaged the machine's legs, obliterated its weapons.\n> Kindjals circled around to deliver the final blow.\n>\n> Surprisingly, the central turret containing the cymek's human brain\n> detached itself. With a bright flash of ignition, locking bolts\n> blasted clear of the set of articulated legs. The armored spherical\n> container rocketed skyward, beyond the reach of Salusan weapons.\n>\n> \"An escape pod to protect the traitor's brain.\" Xavier's words caused\n> him to wheeze and cough more blood. \"Open fire on it!\" His kindjals\n> launched their weapons as the cymek pod soared into the smoky sky with\n> enough thrust to reach escape velocity.\n>\n> \"Damn!\" The pilots shot at the fading exhaust trail, but the cymek's\n> escape pod rapidly dwindled from sight.\n>\n> \"Don't waste your weapons,\" Xavier said over the comline. \"That one's\n> no longer a threat.\" He felt dizzy, either fading into unconsciousness\n> . . . or dying.\n>\n> \"Yes, sir.\" The kindjals turned back toward the ground, concentrating\n> on the next cymek.\n>\n> However, when his assault squadron converged on another enemy, that\n> cymek also launched its escape pod, shooting the brain-case like a\n> cannonball into the sky. \"Hey,\" a pilot complained, \"he retreated\n> before we could give him a black eye!\"\n>\n> \"Maybe we activated their 'turn-tail-and-run' programs,\" another pilot\n> said with a snort.\n>\n> \"As long as they're retreating,\" Xavier said, barely able to hold on\n> to consciousness. He hoped he didn't spiral down and crash. \"Follow me\n> to the next target.\"\n>\n> As if in response to a signal, all the remaining cymeks abandoned\n> their warrior-forms. Escape containers blasted upward like fireworks,\n> vaulting blindly through the scrambler net and out into space, where\n> the robotic fleet could retrieve them.\n>\n> When the cymeks abandoned their assault, the surviving Salusan\n> defenders set up a ragged cheer from the wreckage on the ground.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> OVER THE NEXT several hours, Salusan survivors emerged from shelters,\n> blinking into the smoke-filled skies with a mixture of shock and\n> triumph.\n>\n> After the cymeks had retreated, the frustrated robot fleet had\n> launched a swarm of missiles at the ground, but their gelcircuitry\n> guidance computers also failed. Standard Salusan missile-defense\n> systems obliterated all of the machine weapons before they could reach\n> their targets.\n>\n> Finally, when the recalled battle groups began to converge on the\n> robot fleet, charging in from the perimeter of the Gamma Waiping\n> system, the thinking machines recalculated their chances for success,\n> didn't like the odds, and decided to retreat, leaving much wreckage in\n> orbit.\n>\n> On the surface, Zimia continued to burn, and tens of thousands of\n> bodies lay in the rubble.\n>\n> Xavier had held himself together for the battle, but in its aftermath\n> was barely able to stand. His lungs were full of blood; his mouth\n> tasted of acid. He had insisted that the medics and battlefield\n> surgeons concentrate on the more seriously wounded out in the streets.\n>\n> From a balcony on the top level of the damaged Hall of Parliament, he\n> gazed out at the horrendous damage. The world turned a sickly red\n> around him, and he wavered on his feet, then reeled backward. He heard\n> aides behind him, summoning a doctor.\n>\n> *I cannot consider this a victory*, he thought, then retreated into\n> black unconsciousness.\n>\n> *In the desert, the line between life and death is sharp and quick.*\n\n--- Zensunni Fire Poetry from Arrakis\n\n> **F**ar from thinking machines and the League of Nobles, the desert\n> never changed. The Zensunni descendants who had fled to Arrakis lived\n> in isolated cave communities, barely subsisting in a harsh\n> environment. They experienced little enjoyment, yet fought fiercely to\n> remain alive for just another day.\n>\n> Sunlight poured across the ocean of sand, warming dunes that rippled\n> like waves breaking upon an imagined shore. A few black rocks poked\n> out of the dustlike islands, but offered no shelter from the heat or\n> the demon worms.\n>\n> This desolate landscape was the last thing he would ever see. The\n> people had accused the young man and would mete out their punishment.\n> His innocence was not relevant.\n>\n> \"Begone, Selim!\" came a shout from the caves above. \"Go far from\n> here!\" He recognized the voice of his young friend---*former*\n> friend--- Ebrahim. Perhaps the other boy was relieved, since by rights\n> it should have been him facing exile and death, not Selim. But no one\n> would mourn the loss of an orphan, and so Selim had been cast out in\n> the Zensunni version of justice.\n>\n> A raspy voice said, \"May the worms spit out your scrawny hide.\" That\n> was old Glyffa, who had once been like a mother to him. \"Thief! Water\n> stealer!\"\n>\n> From the caves, the tribe began to throw stones. One sharp rock struck\n> the cloth he had wrapped around his dark hair for protection against\n> the sun. Selim ducked, but did not give them the satisfaction of\n> seeing him cringe. They had stripped almost everything from him, but\n> as long as he drew breath they would never take his pride.\n>\n> Naib Dhartha, the sietch leader, leaned out. \"The tribe has spoken.\"\n>\n> Protestations of his innocence would do no good, nor would excuses or\n> explanations. Keeping his balance on the steep path, the young man\n> stooped to grab a sharp-edged stone. He held it in his palm and glared\n> up at the people.\n>\n> Selim had always been skilled at throwing rocks. He could pick off\n> ravens, small kangaroo mice, or lizards for the community cookpot. If\n> he aimed carefully, he could have put out one of the Naib's eyes.\n> Selim had seen Dhartha whispering quietly with Ebrahim's father,\n> watched them form their plan to cast the blame on him instead of the\n> guilty boy. They had decided Selim's punishment using measures other\n> than the truth.\n>\n> Naib Dhartha had dark eyebrows and jet-black hair bound into a\n> ponytail by a dull metal ring. A purplish geometric tattoo of dark\n> angles and straight lines marked his left cheek. His wife had drawn it\n> on his face using a steel needle and the juice of a scraggly inkvine\n> the Zensunni cultivated in their terrarium gardens. The Naib glared\n> down as if daring Selim to throw the stone, because the Zensunni would\n> respond with a pummeling barrage of large rocks.\n>\n> But such a punishment would kill him far too quickly. Instead, the\n> tribe would drive Selim away from their tight-knit community. And on\n> Arrakis, one did not survive without help. Existence in the desert\n> required cooperation, each person doing his part. The Zensunni looked\n> upon stealing --- especially the theft of water--- as the worst crime\n> imaginable.\n>\n> Selim pocketed the stone. Ignoring the jeers and insults, he continued\n> his tedious descent toward the open desert.\n>\n> Dhartha intoned in a voice that sounded like a bass howl of\n> storm-winds, \"Selim, who has no father or mother--- Selim, who was\n> welcomed as a member of our tribe--- you have been found guilty of\n> stealing tribal water. Therefore, you must walk across the sands.\"\n> Dhartha raised his voice, shouting before the condemned man could pass\n> out of earshot. \"May Shaitan choke on your bones.\"\n>\n> All his life, Selim had done more work than most others. Because he\n> was of unknown parentage, the tribe demanded it of him. No one helped\n> him when he was sick, except maybe old Glyffa; no one carried an extra\n> load for him. He had watched some of his companions gorge themselves\n> on inflated family shares of water, even Ebrahim. And still, the other\n> boy, seeing half a literjon of brackish water untended, had drunk it,\n> foolishly hoping no one would notice. How easy it had been for Ebrahim\n> to blame it on his supposed friend when the theft was discovered. . .\n> .\n>\n> Upon driving Selim from the caves, Dhartha had refused to give him\n> even a tiny water pouch for his journey, because that was considered a\n> waste of tribal resources. None of them expected Selim to survive more\n> than a day anyway, even if he somehow managed to avoid the fearsome\n> monsters of the desert.\n>\n> He muttered under his breath, knowing they couldn't hear him, \"May\n> your mouth fill with dust, Naib Dhartha.\" Selim bounded down the path\n> away from the cliffs, while his people continued to utter curses from\n> above. A hurled pebble bounced past him.\n>\n> When he reached the base of the rock wall that stood as a shield\n> against the desert and the sandworm demons, he set off in a straight\n> line, wanting to get as far away as he could. Dry heat pounded on his\n> head. Those watching him would surely be surprised to see him\n> voluntarily hike out onto the dunes instead of huddling in a cave in\n> the rocks.\n>\n> *What do I have to lose?*\n>\n> Selim made up his mind that he would never go back and plead for help.\n> Instead, chin high, he strode across the dunes as far as he could. He\n> would rather die than beg forgiveness from the likes of them. Ebrahim\n> had lied to protect his own life, but Naib Dhartha had committed a far\n> worse crime in Selim's eyes, knowingly condemning an innocent orphan\n> boy to death because it simplified tribal politics.\n>\n> Selim had excellent desert skills, but Arrakis was a severe\n> environment. In the several generations since the Zensunni had settled\n> here, no one had ever\n>\n> returned from exile. The deep desert swallowed them up, leaving no\n> trace. He trudged out into the wasteland with only a rope slung over\n> his shoulder, a stubby dagger at his belt, and a sharpened metal\n> walking stick, a piece he had salvaged from the spaceport junkyard in\n> Arrakis City.\n>\n> Maybe Selim could go there and find a job with offworld traders,\n> moving cargo from each vessel that landed, or stowing aboard one of\n> the spaceships that plied their way from planet to planet, often\n> taking years for each passage. But such ships only rarely visited\n> Arrakis, since it was far from the regular shipping lanes. And joining\n> the strange offworlders might make Selim give up too much of himself.\n> It would be better to live alone in the desert--- if he could survive.\n> . . .\n>\n> He pocketed another sharp rock, one that had been thrown from above.\n> As the mountain buttress shrank into the distance, he found a third\n> shard that seemed like a good throwing stone. Eventually, he would\n> need to capture food. He could suck a lizard's moist flesh and live\n> for just a little while longer.\n>\n> As he made his way into the restless wasteland, Selim gazed toward a\n> long peninsula of rock, far from the Zensunni caves. He'd be apart\n> from the tribe there, but could still laugh at them every day he\n> survived his exile. He could thumb his nose and call out jokes that\n> Naib Dhartha would never hear.\n>\n> Selim poked his walking stick into the soft dunes, as if stabbing an\n> imaginary enemy. He sketched a deprecating Buddislamic symbol in the\n> sand, with an arrow on it that pointed back toward the cliff\n> dwellings. He took a special satisfaction from his defiance, even\n> though the wind would erase the insult within a day. With a lighter\n> step, he climbed a high dune and skidded down into the trough.\n>\n> He began to sing a traditional song, maintaining an upbeat composure,\n> and increased his speed. The distant peninsula of rock shimmered in\n> the afternoon, and he tried to convince himself that it looked\n> inviting. His bravado increased as he drew farther from his\n> tormentors.\n>\n> But when he was within a kilometer of the sheltering black rock, Selim\n> felt the loose sand tremble under his feet. He looked up, suddenly\n> realizing his danger, and saw ripples that marked the passage of a\n> large creature deep beneath the dunes.\n>\n> Selim ran. He slipped and scrambled across the soft ridge, desperate\n> not to fall. He kept moving, racing along the crest, knowing that even\n> this high dune would prove no obstacle for the oncoming sandworm. The\n> rock peninsula remained impossibly far away, and the demon came ever\n> closer.\n>\n> Selim forced himself to skid to a halt, though his panicked heart\n> urged him to keep running. Worms followed any vibration, and he had\n> run like a terrified child instead of freezing in place like the wily\n> desert hare. This behemoth had certainly targeted him by now. How many\n> others before him had stood terrified, falling to their knees in final\n> prayer before being devoured? No person had ever survived an encounter\n> with one of the great desert monsters.\n>\n> Unless he could fool it . . . distract it.\n>\n> Selim willed his feet and legs to turn to stone. He took the first of\n> the fist-sized stones he carried and hurled it as far as he could into\n> the gully between dunes. It landed with a *thump*--- and the ominous\n> track of the approaching worm diverted just a little.\n>\n> He tossed another rock, and a third, in a drumbeat pattern intended to\n> lure the worm away from him. Selim threw the rest of his stones, and\n> the beast turned only slightly, rising up in the dunes close to him.\n>\n> Empty handed, he now had no other way to divert the creature.\n>\n> Its maw open wide, the worm gulped sand and stones, searching for a\n> morsel of meat. The sand beneath Selim's boots shifted and crumbled at\n> the edge of the worm's path, and he knew the monster would swallow\n> him. He smelled an ominous cinammon stench on the worm's breath, saw\n> glimpses of fire in its gullet.\n>\n> Naib Dhartha would no doubt laugh at the young thief's fate. Selim\n> shouted a loud curse. And rather than surrender, he decided to attack.\n>\n> Closer to the cavernous mouth, the odor of spice intensified. The\n> young man gripped his metal walking stick and whispered a prayer. As\n> the worm lifted itself from beneath the dune, Selim leaped onto its\n> curved and crusty back. He raised the metal staff like a spear and\n> plunged the sharpened tip into what he thought would be tough, armored\n> worm-skin. Instead, the point slipped between segments, into soft pink\n> flesh.\n>\n> The beast reacted as if it had been shot with a maula cannon. It\n> reared up, thrashed, and writhed.\n>\n> Surprised, Selim drove the spear deeper and held on with all his\n> strength. He squeezed his eyes shut, clenching his teeth and pulling\n> back to keep himself steady. He would have no chance if he let go.\n>\n> Despite the worm's violent reaction, the little spear couldn't have\n> wounded it; this was merely a human gesture of defiance, a biting fly\n> thirsty for a sweet droplet of blood. Any moment now the worm would\n> dive back beneath the sand and drag Selim down with it.\n>\n> Surprisingly, though, the creature raced forward, keeping itself high\n> out of the dunes where the exposed tissue would not be abraded by\n> sand.\n>\n> Terrified, Selim clung to the implanted staff--- then laughed as he\n> realized he was actually *riding* Shaitan himself! Had anyone ever\n> done such a thing? If so, no man had ever lived to tell about it.\n>\n> Selim made a pact with himself and with Buddallah that he would not be\n> defeated, not by Naib Dhartha and not by this desert demon. He pulled\n> back on his spear and pried the fleshy segment even wider, making the\n> worm climb out of the sand, as if it could outrun the annoying\n> parasite on its back. . . .\n>\n> The young exile never made it to the strip of rock where he had hoped\n> to establish a private camp. Instead, the worm careened into the deep\n>\n> desert . . . carrying Selim far from his former life.\n>\n> *We learned a negative thing from computers, that the setting of\n> guidelines belongs to humans, not to machines.*\n\n--- RELL ARKOV,\n\ncharter meeting of the League of Nobles\n\n> **A**fter being rebuffed on Salusa Secundus, the thinking-machine\n> fleet headed back to their distant base on Corrin.

Agamemnon chose a\n> site within a yawning crater, and the other Titans dropped beside his\n> vessel, finding stable terrain on a rippled plain.\n>\n> Inside his ship, Agamemnon guided mechanical arms that lifted his\n> enclosed brain canister from its control socket and installed it into\n> another mobile terrestrial body with a set of six sturdy legs and a\n> low-slung body core. After connecting the thoughtrodes that linked his\n> mind through electrafluid, he tested his gleaming legs, lifting the\n> metal pads and adjusting the hydraulics.\n>\n> He walked his graceful mechanical body down the ramp onto the soft\n> rock. The other Titans joined him, each wearing a walker body with\n> visible internal workings and life-support systems impervious to the\n> blazing heat and radiation. The bloodshot dwarf star loomed overhead\n> in the black, airless sky.\n>\n> The first of the surviving Titans came forward to touch sensor pads\n> against the general's mechanical body, delicate probings in a romantic\n> caress. Juno was a strategic genius who had been Agamemnon's lover\n> back when they had worn human bodies. Now, a millennium later, they\n> continued their partnership, needing little more than the aphrodisiac\n> of power.\n>\n> \"Will we move forward soon, my love?\" Juno asked. \"Or must we wait\n> another century or two?\"\n>\n> \"Not so long, Juno. Not nearly so long.\"\n>\n> Next came Barbarossa, the closest thing to a masculine friend\n> Agamemnon had known for the past thousand years. \"Every moment is\n> already an eternity,\" he said. During the Titans' initial takeover,\n> Barbarossa had discovered how to subvert the Old Empire's ubiquitous\n> thinking machines. Luckily, the modest genius had also had the\n> foresight to implant deep\n>\n> programming restrictions that prevented thinking machines from doing\n> any outright harm to the Titans--- restrictions that had kept\n> Agamemnon and his cymek companions alive after the evermind's\n> treacherous takeover.\n>\n> \"I can't decide if I'd rather smash computers or humans,\" Ajax said.\n> The most powerful enforcer of the old cymeks, the brutal bully clomped\n> forward in a particularly massive walker-form, as if still flexing the\n> muscles of his long-ago organic body.\n>\n> \"We must cover our tracks twice for every plan we make.\" Dante, a\n> skilled bureaucrat and accountant, had an easy grasp of complex\n> details. Among the Titans, he had never been dramatic or glamorous,\n> but the overthrow of the Old Empire could not have been achieved\n> without his clever manipulations of clerical and administrative\n> matters. With none of the bravado of the other conquerors, Dante had\n> calmly worked out an equitable division of leadership that had\n> permitted the Titans to rule smoothly for a century.\n>\n> Until the computers had wrested it all from them.\n>\n> The disgraced Xerxes was the last cymek to clamber into the sheltered\n> crater. The lowliest Titan had long ago committed the unforgivable\n> mistake that allowed the ambitious newborn computer mind to hamstring\n> them all. Although the Titans still needed him as part of their\n> ever-dwindling group, Agamemnon had never forgiven him for the\n> blunder. For centuries, miserable Xerxes had had no other desire than\n> to make up for his error. He foolishly believed that Agamemnon might\n> embrace him again if he could find a way to redeem himself, and the\n> cymek general made use of such enthusiasm.\n>\n> Agamemnon led his five co-conspirators across the terrain to the\n> crater shadows. There, the machines with human minds faced each other\n> among broken rocks and half-melted boulders to speak their treason and\n> plot revenge.\n>\n> Xerxes, despite his flaws, would never betray them. A thousand years\n> ago, after their victory, the original Titans had agreed to surgical\n> conversion\n>\n> rather than accept their mortality, so that their disembodied brains\n> could live forever and consolidate their rule. It had been a dramatic\n> pact.\n>\n> Now, Omnius occasionally rewarded loyal human followers by converting\n> them to neo-cymeks, as well. Across the Synchronized Worlds, thousands\n> of newer brains with machine bodies served as indentured servants to\n> the evermind. Agamemnon could not rely upon anyone who willingly\n> served the evermind, however.\n>\n> The cymek general transmitted his words on a tight waveband that\n> tapped directly into the Titans' thought-processing centers. \"We are\n> not expected back on Corrin for weeks. I have seized this opportunity\n> so that we may plan a strike against Omnius.\"\n>\n> \"It's about time,\" Ajax said, his voice a deep grumble.\n>\n> \"Do you believe the evermind has grown complacent, my love--- like the\n> humans of the Old Empire?\" Juno asked.\n>\n> \"I have noted no particular sign of weakness,\" Dante interjected, \"and\n> I keep careful track of such things.\"\n>\n> \"There are always weaknesses,\" Ajax said, twitching one of his heavy\n> armored legs and gouging a hole in the ground, \"*if* you're willing to\n> use enough muscle to exploit them.\"\n>\n> Barbarossa clacked one of his metal forelegs on the hard rock. \"Do not\n> be fooled by artificial intelligence. Computers do not think like\n> humans. Even after a thousand years, Omnius will not let his attention\n> wander. He has enough processing power and more watcheyes than we can\n> count.\"\n>\n> \"Does he suspect us? Does Omnius doubt our loyalty?\" Xerxes already\n> sounded worried, and the meeting had just begun. \"If he thinks we are\n> plotting against him, why won't he just eliminate us?\"\n>\n> \"Sometimes I think you have a leak in your brain canister,\" Agamemnon\n> said. \"Omnius has programming restrictions that prevent him from\n> killing\n>\n> us.\"\n>\n> \"You don't have to be insulting. It's just that Omnius is so powerful,\n> you'd think he could override whatever Barbarossa loaded into his\n> system.\"\n>\n> \"He hasn't yet, and never will. I knew what I was doing on that job,\n> believe me,\" Barbarossa said. \"Remember, Omnius yearns to be\n> efficient. He will take no unnecessary actions, will not waste\n> resources. *We are resources to him*.\"\n>\n> Dante said, \"If Omnius is so intent on ruling efficiently, then why\n> does he keep human slaves around at all? Even simple robots and\n> minimal-AI machines could perform their tasks with less bother.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon paced out of the thick shadows into harsh light, and then\n> back again. Around him, the conspirators waited like huge insects made\n> of scrap metal. \"For years, I have been suggesting that we exterminate\n> the human captives on the Synchronized Worlds, but Omnius refuses.\"\n>\n> \"Maybe he's reluctant because humans created thinking machines in the\n> first place,\" Xerxes suggested. \"Omnius might see humans as a\n> manifestation of God.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon chided him. \"Are you suggesting that the computer evermind\n> is devoutly religious?\" The disgraced cymek quickly fell silent.\n>\n> Barbarossa said, like a patient teacher, \"No, no--- Omnius simply\n> doesn't wish to expend the energy or cause the turmoil that such an\n> extermination would bring about. He sees humans as resources, not to\n> be wasted.\"\n>\n> \"We've been trying to convince him otherwise for centuries,\" Ajax\n> said.\n>\n> Aware that their safe window of time was rapidly dwindling, Agamemnon\n> pushed the discussion forward. \"We must find some way to spark a\n> radical change. If we shut the computers down, then we Titans rule\n> once more, along with any neo-cymeks we can recruit.\" He swiveled his\n> sensor-turret. \"We've taken charge before and must do it again.\"\n>\n> Previously, when the human Titans had consolidated the stagnant Old\n> Empire, combat robots had done the bulk of the fighting for them.\n> Tlaloc, Agamemnon, and the other rebels had simply picked up the\n> pieces. This time the Titans would have to fight for themselves.\n>\n> \"Maybe we should try to find Hecate,\" Xerxes said. \"She's the only one\n> of us who has never been under Omnius's control. Our wild card.\"\n>\n> Hecate, the former mate of Ajax, was the sole Titan who had\n> relinquished her rule. Before the thinking machine takeover, she had\n> departed into deep space, never to be heard from again. But Agamemnon\n> could never trust her\n>\n> --- even if she could be located--- any more than he trusted Xerxes.\n> Hecate had abandoned them long ago; she was not the ally they needed.\n>\n> \"We should look elsewhere for assistance, take any help we can find,\"\n> Agamemnon said. \"My son Vorian is one of the few humans allowed access\n> to the central complex of the Earth-Omnius, and he delivers regular\n> updates to the everminds on other Synchronized Worlds. Perhaps we can\n> use him.\"\n>\n> Juno simulated a laugh. \"You want to trust a human, my love? One of\n> the weak vermin you despise? Moments ago you wanted to exterminate\n> every member of the race.\"\n>\n> \"Vorian is my genetic son, and the best of my offspring so far. I have\n> been watching him, training him. He has read my memoirs a dozen times\n> already. I have high hopes that one day he will be a worthy\n> successor.\"\n>\n> Juno understood Agamemnon better than the other Titans did. \"You've\n> said similar things about your twelve previous sons, if I recall. Even\n> so, you found excuses to kill all of them.\"\n>\n> \"I preserved plenty of my sperm before converting myself into a cymek,\n> and I have the time to do it right,\" Agamemnon said. \"But Vorian . . .\n> ah, Vorian, I think he might be the one. One day I'll let him become a\n> cymek.\"\n>\n> Ajax interrupted, his voice pitched low, \"We cannot fight two major\n> enemies at once. Since Omnius has finally allowed us to attack the\n> *hrethgir,*\n>\n> thanks to Barbarossa's victory in the gladiator ring, I say we\n> prosecute that war to the best of our abilities. Afterward, we deal\n> with Omnius.\"\n>\n> Immersed in the crater shadows, the cymeks muttered, half-agreeing.\n> The League humans had escaped Titan rule centuries ago, and the old\n> cymeks had always harbored a hatred toward them. Dante's optic threads\n> tracked back and forth, calculating. \"Yes, the humans should be easier\n> to defeat.\"\n>\n> \"Meanwhile, we continue to seek a means to eliminate Omnius,\"\n> Barbarossa added. \"Everything in its time.\"\n>\n> \"Perhaps you are correct,\" Agamemnon admitted. The cymek general did\n> not want to extend this clandestine gathering much longer.\n>\n> He led the march back to their individual ships. \"We destroy the\n> League humans first. Using that as a springboard, we then turn our\n> attention to the more difficult foe.\"\n>\n> *Logic is blind and often knows only its own past.*\n>\n> --- archives from *Genetics to Philosophy,*\n>\n> compiled by the Sorceresses of Rossak\n>\n> **T**hinking machines cared little for aesthetics, but the Omnius\n> update ship was--- by accident of design--- a beautifully sleek\n> silver-and-black vessel, dwarfed by the immensity of the cosmos as it\n> journeyed from one Synchronized World to another. Finished with its\n> current round of updates, the *Dream Voyager* was on its way back to\n> Earth.\n>\n> Vorian Atreides considered himself fortunate to be entrusted with such\n> a vital assignment. Born from a female slave impregnated with\n> Agamemnon's preserved sperm, dark-haired Vorian could trace his\n> lineage back past the Time of Titans, thousands of years to the House\n> of Atreus in ancient Greece and another famous Agamemnon. Because of\n> his father's status, twenty-year-old Vor had been raised and\n> indoctrinated on Earth under the thinking machines. He was one of the\n> privileged \"trustee\" humans permitted to move about freely, serving\n> Omnius.\n>\n> He had read all the stories of his illustrious bloodline in the\n> extensive memoirs his father had written to document his triumphs. Vor\n> considered the Titan general's great work to be more than a literary\n> masterpiece, closer to a holy historical document.\n>\n> Just forward of Vor's work station, the *Dream Voyager*'s captain, an\n> autonomous robot, checked instruments unerringly. Seurat's\n> coppery-metal skinfilm flowed over a man-shaped body of polymer\n> struts, alloy supports, gelcircuitry processors, and wound\n> elastic-weave musculature.\n>\n> While Seurat studied the instruments, he intermittently tapped into\n> the ship's long-range scanners or looked out the windowport with\n> focused optic threads. Multiprocessing as he conversed, the robot\n> captain continued the interplay with his subservient human copilot.\n> Seurat had a strange and unfortunate penchant for telling odd jokes.\n>\n> \"Vorian, what do you get when you breed a pig with a human?\"\n>\n> \"What?\"\n>\n> \"A creature that still eats a great deal, still stinks, and still does\n> no work!\"\n>\n> Vorian favored the captain with a polite chuckle. Most of the time,\n> Seurat's jokes only demonstrated that the robot did not truly\n> understand humor. But if Vor didn't laugh, Seurat would simply tell\n> another one, and another, until he obtained the desired reaction.\n> \"Aren't you afraid you'll make an error by telling jokes while\n> monitoring our navigation systems?\"\n>\n> \"I don't make mistakes,\" Seurat said, in his staccato mechanical\n> voice.\n>\n> Vor brightened with the challenge. \"Ah, but what if I sabotaged one of\n> the ship's vital functions? We're the only ones aboard, and I *am* a\n> deceitful human after all, your mortal enemy. It would serve you right\n> for all those terrible jokes.\"\n>\n> \"I might expect that of a lowly slave or even an artisan worker, but\n> *you* would never do that, Vorian. You have too much to lose.\" With an\n> eerily smooth movement, Seurat turned his rippled coppery head, paying\n> even less attention to the *Dream Voyager*'s controls. \"And even if\n> you did, I would figure it out.\"\n>\n> \"Don't underestimate me, old Metalmind. My father teaches me that,\n> despite our many weaknesses, we humans have a trump card with our very\n> unpredictability.\" Smiling, Vorian went to the robot captain's side\n> and studied the metric screens. \"Why do you think Omnius asks me to\n> throw a wrench into his careful simulations every time he plans an\n> encounter with the *hrethgir*?\"\n>\n> \"Your outrageous and reckless chaos is the only reason you are able to\n> beat me in any strategy game,\" Seurat said. \"It certainly has nothing\n> to do with your innate skills.\"\n>\n> \"A winner has more skills than a loser,\" Vor said, \"no matter how you\n> define the competition.\"\n>\n> The update ship traveled on a regular, continuous route throughout the\n> Synchronized Worlds. One of fifteen such vessels, the *Dream Voyager*\n> carried copies of the current version of Omnius to synchronize the\n> separate computer everminds on widely separated planets.\n>\n> Circuitry limitations and electronic transmission speeds constrained\n> the physical size of any individual machine; thus, the same computer\n> evermind could not viably extend beyond a single planet. Nonetheless,\n> duplicate copies of Omnius existed everywhere, like mental clones.\n> With regular updates continually exchanged by ships like the *Dream\n> Voyager*, all the separate Omnius incarnations remained virtually\n> identical across the machine-dominated autarchy.\n>\n> After many voyages, Vor knew how to operate the ship and could access\n> all onboard data banks using Seurat's codes. Over the years, he and\n> the robot captain had become fast friends in a way that others were\n> not likely to understand. Because of the extended time they shared in\n> deep space, talking about many things, playing games of skill, telling\n> stories--- they bridged much of the gap between machine and man.\n>\n> Sometimes, for amusement, Vor and Seurat traded places, and Vor\n> pretended to be the captain of the ship, while Seurat became his\n> robotic underling, as in the days of the Old Empire. During one\n> role-playing session, Vorian had impulsively christened the ship\n> *Dream Voyager*, a bit of poetic nonsense that Seurat not only\n> tolerated, but maintained.\n>\n> As a sentient machine, Seurat routinely received new instructions and\n> memory transfers from the overall Omnius brain, but because he spent\n> so much time disconnected while journeying between the stars, he had\n> developed his own personality and independence. In Vor's opinion,\n> Seurat was the best of the machine minds, although the robot could be\n> irritating at times. Especially with that peculiar sense of humor.\n>\n> Vor clasped his hands and cracked his knuckles. He sighed with\n> pleasure. \"Sure feels good to loosen up. Too bad it's something you\n> can't do.\"\n>\n> \"I do not require loosening up.\"\n>\n> Vorian didn't admit that he, too, found his own organic body to be\n> inferior in many ways, fragile and prone to aches, sicknesses, and\n> injuries that any machine could have easily fixed. He hoped that his\n> physical form would remain functional long enough for him to be made\n> into one of the enduring neo-cymeks, all of whom had once been valued\n> trustee humans, like himself. One day Agamemnon would receive\n> permission from Omnius for that, if Vor worked very hard to serve the\n> evermind.\n>\n> The *Dream Voyager* had been in space on a long update run, and the\n> young trustee was glad to be going home. He would see his eminent\n> father soon.\n>\n> As the *Dream Voyager* soared between stars, undisturbed, Seurat\n> suggested a friendly competition. The two sat at a table and engaged\n> in one of their customary diversions, an amusing private game they had\n> developed through frequent practice. The strategy involved an\n> imaginary space battle between two alien races--- the \"Vorians\" and\n> the \"Seurats\"--- each of which had a space fleet with precise\n> capabilities and limitations. Though the robot captain had a perfect\n> machine memory, Vor still fared well, as he invariably came up with\n> creative tactics that surprised his opponent.\n>\n> Now, as they took turns placing warships in the various sectors of\n> their fanciful space battlefield, Seurat reeled off an endless\n> succession of human jokes and riddles he had found in his old\n> databases. Annoyed, Vor finally said, \"You're making an overt attempt\n> to distract me. Where did you learn to do that?\"\n>\n> \"Why, from you, of course.\" The robot proceeded to mention the many\n> times in which Vor had teased him, threatening to sabotage the ship\n> without ever really intending to do so, concocting extraordinarily\n> unpredictable emergencies. \"Do you consider it cheating? On your part,\n> or on mine?\"\n>\n> This revelation astonished Vor. \"It saddens me to think that, even in\n> jest, I have taught you deception. It makes me ashamed to be human.\"\n> No doubt, Agamemnon would be disappointed in him.\n>\n> After two more rounds, Vor lost the tactical game. His heart was no\n> longer in it.\n>\n> *Every endeavor is a game, is it not?*\n\n--- IBLIS GINJO,\n\n*Options for Total Liberation*\n\n> **O**n a garden terrace overlooking the scarred ruins of Zimia, Xavier\n> Harkonnen stood somberly by himself, dreading the upcoming \"victory\"\n> parade. Afternoon sunlight warmed his face. Birdsong had replaced the\n> screams and explosions; breezes had scoured away the worst of the\n> poisonous smoke.\n>\n> Still, the League would be a long time recovering. Nothing would ever\n> be the same.\n>\n> Even days after the attack, he still saw smears of smoke wafting from\n> the rubble and trailing into a cloudless sky. He could not smell the\n> soot, though. The cymeks' poison gas had so damaged his tissues that\n> he would never smell or taste much of anything again. Even breathing\n> had become no more that a mechanical act, not an enjoyable inhalation\n> of sweet fresh air.\n>\n> But he could not wallow in misery when so many others had lost much\n> more. In the aftermath of the cymek attack, he had been kept alive by\n> the heroic efforts of a Salusan medical team. Serena Butler had come\n> to him at the hospital, but he remembered her only through a fog of\n> pain, drugs, and life-support systems. In an extraordinary procedure,\n> Xavier had received a double lung transplant, healthy organs provided\n> by the mysterious Tlulaxa. He knew Serena had worked vigorously with\n> the brilliant battlefield surgeons and a Tlulaxa flesh merchant named\n> Tuk Keedair to get him the treatment he needed.\n>\n> Now he could breathe again, despite intermittent bursts of pain.\n> Xavier would live to fight the machines another time. Thanks to\n> pharmaceuticals and advanced healing techniques, he had been able to\n> leave the hospital soon after the medical procedure.\n>\n> At the time of the attack, the flesh merchant Keedair had been in\n> Zimia on a routine sales call and barely escaped with his life. On the\n> Unallied Planet of Tlulax in the distant Thalim solar system, his\n> people ran organ farms, growing human hearts, lungs, kidneys, and\n> other body parts from viable cells. After the cymeks were driven away,\n> the secretive Tlulaxa had offered his biological wares to the\n> battlefield surgeons at Zimia's main field hospital. His ship's\n> cryogenic lockers were filled with sample body parts. A stroke of\n> luck, Keedair had admitted with a smile, that he could be there to\n> help the grievously injured Salusan citizens during their time of\n> great need.\n>\n> Following the successful surgery, Keedair had come to see Xavier in\n> the medical center. The Tlulaxa was a man of middle height but slight\n> of build, with dark eyes and an angular face. A long, dark braid hung\n> at the left side of his head, plaited tightly.\n>\n> Breathing in, carefully modulating his raspy voice, Xavier said, \"It\n> was fortunate you were here with new organs already stored aboard your\n> ship.\"\n>\n> Keedair rubbed his long-fingered hands together. \"If I had known the\n> cymeks would strike so ferociously, I would have brought a larger\n> supply of material from our organ farms. Your Salusan survivors could\n> use many more replacement parts, but additional ships cannot arrive\n> from the Thalim system for months.\"\n>\n> Before the flesh merchant left Xavier's room, he turned back and said,\n> \"Consider yourself one of the lucky ones, Tercero Harkonnen.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> IN BATTLE-SCARRED ZIMIA, grief-stricken survivors searched for their\n> dead, and buried them. As rubble was cleared, the death toll mounted.\n> Bodies were recovered, names of the missing were compiled. In spite of\n> such pain and sorrow, because of the attack free humanity grew\n> stronger.\n>\n> Viceroy Manion Butler had insisted that the people show only\n> determination in the aftermath. On the streets below Xavier's terrace,\n> final preparations were under way for a celebration of thanksgiving.\n> Banners\n>\n> with the open-hand sigil of human freedom fluttered in the wind.\n> Rough-looking men in dirty coats struggled to control magnificent\n> white Salusan stallions that had become agitated by the commotion. The\n> horses' manes were braided with tassles and bells, and their tails\n> swept behind them like waterfalls of fine hair. Festooned with ribbons\n> and flowers, the animals pranced, eager to march down the broad\n> central boulevard that had been washed clean of debris, soot, and\n> bloodstains.\n>\n> Xavier glanced uncertainly at the sky. How could he ever look at the\n> clouds again without dreading that he might see more pyramidal\n> dropcarriages plunging through the scrambler shields? Missiles were\n> already being installed, increased batteries to protect against an\n> attack from space. More patrols would be launched, circling the system\n> on the highest state of alert.\n>\n> Instead of attending a parade, he should be preparing the Salusan\n> Militia for another attack, increasing the number of picket ships and\n> scouts at the edge of the system, working out a more efficient rescue\n> and response plan. It was only a matter of time before the thinking\n> machines returned.\n>\n> The next meeting of the League Parliament would devote itself to\n> emergency measures and reparations. The representatives would sketch\n> out a reconstruction plan for Zimia. The cymek warrior-forms left\n> behind must be dismantled and analyzed for weaknesses.\n>\n> Xavier hoped the League would immediately dispatch a summons to\n> Poritrin, calling the brilliant Tio Holtzman to inspect his recently\n> installed scrambler shields. Only the great inventor himself could\n> devise a stopgap measure against the technical flaw the cymeks had\n> discovered.\n>\n> When Xavier mentioned his concerns to Viceroy Butler, the florid-faced\n> leader had nodded, but stopped further discussion. \"First, we must\n> have a day of affirmation, to celebrate the fact that we are alive.\"\n> Xavier saw deep sadness behind the Viceroy's mask of confidence. \"We\n> are not machines, Xavier. There must be more to our lives than war and\n> revenge.\"\n>\n> Hearing footsteps on the terrace, Xavier turned to see Serena Butler\n> smiling at him, her eyes flashing with a secret depth that she shared\n> with him now\n>\n> that no one could see the two of them. \"There is my heroic tercero.\"\n>\n> \"A man responsible for letting half a city be destroyed isn't usually\n> called a hero, Serena.\"\n>\n> \"No, but the term does apply to a man who saved the rest of the\n> planet. As you are fully aware, if you hadn't made your hard choice,\n> all of Zimia, all of Salusa, would have been crushed.\" She put a hand\n> on his shoulder and stood very close to him. \"I won't have you\n> wallowing in guilt during the victory parade. One day won't make much\n> difference.\"\n>\n> \"One day could very well make a *huge* difference,\" Xavier insisted.\n> \"We barely drove off the attackers this time because we were too\n> confident in the new scrambler shields, and because we foolishly\n> thought Omnius had decided to leave us alone after so many decades.\n> This would be the perfect time for them to hit us again. What if\n> they've launched a second wave?\"\n>\n> \"Omnius is still licking his wounds. I doubt his force has even\n> returned to the Synchronized Worlds yet.\"\n>\n> \"Machines don't lick wounds,\" he said.\n>\n> \"You're such a serious young man,\" she said. \"Please, just for the\n> parade? Our people need to have their spirits uplifted.\"\n>\n> \"Your father already gave me the same lecture.\"\n>\n> \"You know, of course, that if two Butlers say a thing, it's bound to\n> be true.\"\n>\n> He gave Serena a firm hug, then followed her from the terrace toward\n> the parade reviewing stand, where he would sit in a place of honor\n> beside the Viceroy.\n>\n> Since they'd been children, Xavier had always found himself attracted\n> to Serena; as they matured, they had grown confident of their\n> deepening feelings toward each other. Both he and Serena considered it\n> a foregone\n>\n> conclusion that they would wed, a rare perfect match of politics,\n> acceptable bloodlines, and romance.\n>\n> Now, though, with the sudden increase in hostilities, he reminded\n> himself of his greater priorities. Thanks to the disaster that had\n> killed Primero Meach, Xavier Harkonnen was interim commander of the\n> Salusan Militia, which forced him to face larger issues. He wanted to\n> do so much, but he was only one man.\n>\n> An hour later, the assemblage sat on a grandstand in the central\n> plaza. Scaffolding and temporary girders shored up the broken facades\n> of government buildings. The ornamental fountains no longer\n> functioned, but the citizens of Zimia knew there could be no other\n> place for such a presentation.\n>\n> Even burned and damaged, the tall edifices looked magnificent:\n> constructed in Salusan Gothic style with multilevel roof lines,\n> spires, and carved columns. Salusa Secundus was the seat of the League\n> government, but it also hosted the leading cultural and\n> anthropological museums. In surrounding neighborhoods, the crowded\n> dwellings were of simpler construction but pleasing to the eye,\n> whitewashed with lime taken from chalk cliffs. Salusans prided\n> themselves on having the best craftsmen and artisans in the League.\n> They did most of their production by hand instead of with automated\n> machinery.\n>\n> Along the parade route, the citizens dressed in colorful raiment of\n> magenta, blue, and yellow. People chattered and pointed as the\n> remarkable stallions passed them, followed by marching musicians and\n> folk dancers on hover-floats. One monstrous Salusan bull, drugged into\n> a near stupor to control it, plodded down the street.\n>\n> Though Xavier made the best of it all, he found himself constantly\n> glancing at the sky, and at the scars of the wounded city. . . .\n>\n> At the conclusion of the parade, Manion Butler delivered a speech\n> celebrating the successful defense but acknowledging the high cost of\n> the battle, tens of thousands killed or wounded. \"We have much healing\n> and\n>\n> recovery to do, but we also have an unbroken spirit, no matter what\n> the thinking machines may attempt.\"\n>\n> Addressing the crowd, the Viceroy summoned Xavier to the central\n> platform. \"I present for you our greatest hero, a man who stood firm\n> against the cymeks and made the *necessary* decisions to save us all.\n> Few others would have been strong enough to do the same.\"\n>\n> Feeling out of place, Xavier stepped forward to receive a military\n> medal on a striped blue, red, and gold ribbon from the Viceroy. In the\n> midst of cheers, Serena kissed him on the cheek. He hoped no one in\n> the crowd could see him blush.\n>\n> \"With this commendation comes a promotion to the rank of Tercero,\n> First Grade. Xavier Harkonnen, I charge you with studying defensive\n> tactics and installations for the entire League Armada. Your duties\n> will encompass the local Salusan Militia, along with responsibility\n> for improving the military security of the entire League of Nobles.\"\n>\n> The young officer felt awkward from the attention, but he graciously\n> accepted the accolades. \"I look forward to beginning the hard work of\n> our survival . . . and advancement.\" He favored Serena with an\n> indulgent smile. \"Following today's festivities, of course.\"\n>\n> *Dune is the planet-child of the worm.*\n\n--- from \"The Legend of Selim Wormrider,\" Zensunni Fire Poetry\n\n> **F**or an entire day and deep into the night, the monstrous sandworm\n> raced across the desert, forced beyond its normal territorial range.\n>\n> As the two moons rose and shone their curious light down upon Selim,\n> he clung to his metal staff, completely exhausted. Though he had\n> escaped being devoured by the wild and confused creature, he might\n> soon perish from the interminable ride. Buddallah had saved him, but\n> now seemed only to be toying with him.\n>\n> While thrusting the corroded spear, the youth had wedged himself into\n> a gap between worm segments, hoping he wouldn't be buried alive if the\n> demon plunged beneath the dunes. He huddled against rank flesh that\n> smelled of rotten meat impregnated with pungent cinnamon. He didn't\n> know what to do, but prayed and contemplated, searching for an\n> explanation.\n>\n> *Perhaps it is a test of some kind.*\n>\n> The sandworm continued to flee across the desert, its undersized brain\n> seemingly resigned to never again finding peace or safety. The beast\n> wanted to wallow into the dunes and hide from this malicious imp, but\n> Selim pried the spear as if it were a lever, irritating the wound\n> anew.\n>\n> The worm could only surge onward. Hour after hour.\n>\n> Selim's throat was parched, his eyes caked with grit. He must have\n> crossed half the desert already, and recognized no landforms on the\n> monotonous open bled. He had never been so far from the cave\n> community--- no one had, as far as he knew. Even if he somehow escaped\n> this giant monster, he would be doomed in the unforgiving Arrakis\n> wasteland because of his unjust sentence.\n>\n> He was certain his faithless friend Ebrahim would be exposed one day,\n> and the truth would come out; the traitor would violate other tribal\n> rules, and would eventually be recognized for the thief and liar that\n> he was. If Selim ever saw him again, he would challenge Ebrahim to a\n> fight to the death, and honor would win out.\n>\n> Perhaps the tribe would applaud him, since no one in even the grandest\n> fire poems had ever braved a giant sandworm and lived. Maybe the\n> saucy, dark-eyed young Zensunni women would look at Selim with bright\n> smiles. Dust-covered but with his head held high, he would stand\n> before stern Naib Dhartha and demand readmittance to the community. To\n> have ridden a desert demon and *lived!*\n>\n> But, though Selim had already managed to survive longer than he had\n> ever hoped, the outcome was by no means assured. What was he to do\n> now?\n>\n> Beneath him, the worm made peculiar, agitated noises, an invertebrate\n> sound beyond the loud whisper of hot sand. The weary beast shuddered,\n> and a tremor ran down its sinuous body. Selim could smell flint and an\n> overpowering aroma of spice. Friction-induced furnaces burned inside\n> the worm's gullet, like the depths of Sheol itself.\n>\n> As lemony dawn tinged the sky, the worm became more unruly and\n> desperate. It thrashed about, trying to dig itself into the sand, but\n> Selim wouldn't permit that. The monster slammed its blunt head into a\n> dune, smashing a dust spray into the air. The youth had to throw all\n> of his body weight against the spear, digging into the raw, exposed\n> worm segment.\n>\n> \"You are as sore and exhausted as I am, aren't you, Shaitan?\" he said\n> in a voice as thin and dry as paper. *Almost exhausted unto death*.\n>\n> Selim didn't dare let go. The moment he dropped off onto the barren\n> dunes, the sandworm would turn about and devour him. He had no choice\n> but to keep driving the creature. The ordeal seemed endless.\n>\n> As daylight grew brighter, he noticed a faint haze on the far horizon,\n> a distant storm with winds bearing flakes of sand and dust. But the\n>\n> disturbance was far away, and Selim had other concerns.\n>\n> At last, the demon worm ground itself to a halt not far from a ridge\n> of rocks, and refused to move. With a final convulsion, it slumped its\n> serpentine head onto a dune crest and lay like a slain dragon,\n> quivering . . . then went utterly still.\n>\n> Selim trembled with absolute weariness, fearing this was some kind of\n> final trick. The monster might be waiting for him to drop his guard so\n> it could swallow him up. Could a sandworm be devious? Was it truly\n> Shaitan?*Or did I ride it to death?*\n>\n> Gathering his energy, Selim straightened. His cramped muscles\n> trembled. He could barely move. Joints were numb; nerves prickled as\n> they awakened with the creeping fire of restored circulation. At last,\n> risking all, he yanked the metal spear from the pink flesh between the\n> callused segments.\n>\n> The worm didn't even twitch.\n>\n> Selim slid down the rounded bulk and hit the sand running. His boots\n> pumped up little dust clouds as he raced across the undulating\n> landscape. The far-off rocks were black mounds of safety protruding\n> from golden dunes.\n>\n> He refused to look behind him and ran on, gasping. Each breath was\n> like dry fire in his throat. His ears tingled, anticipating the hiss\n> of sand, the rippling approach of the vengeful creature. But the\n> sandworm remained still.\n>\n> Filled with desperate energy, Selim sprinted for half a kilometer.\n> Reaching the rock barricade, he scrambled up and finally allowed\n> himself to collapse. Drawing his knees against his chest, he sat\n> gazing out into the wash of daylight, watching the worm.\n>\n> It never moved. *Is Shaitan playing a trick? Is Buddallah testing me?*\n>\n> By now Selim was very, very hungry. He shouted at the sky, \"If you\n> have saved me for some purpose, then why not offer a bit of food?\" In\n> the extremity of his exhaustion, he began to chuckle.\n>\n> *One does not make demands of God*.\n>\n> Then he realized that there was food, of a sort. In his flight to the\n> rock sanctuary, Selim had crossed a thick ochre patch of spice, veins\n> of melange like those the Zensunni sometimes found when they ventured\n> onto the sands. They gathered the substance, using it as a food\n> additive and stimulant. Naib Dhartha kept a small stockpile within the\n> cave warrens, occasionally brewing from it a potent spice beer, which\n> the tribe members consumed on special occasions and traded at the\n> Arrakis City spaceport.\n>\n> He sat in the uncertain shade for nearly an hour, looking for any sign\n> of movement from the monster. Nothing. The day became hotter, and the\n> desert lapsed into a sluggish silence. The distant storm seemed to\n> move no closer. Selim felt as if the world itself was holding its\n> breath.\n>\n> Then, growing brash again--- after all, he had ridden Shaitan!---\n> Selim crawled down from the rocks and scurried out to the patch of\n> melange. There, he raised a wary gaze in the direction of the ominous\n> hulk.\n>\n> Standing in the rust-hued sand, he scrabbled with his hands, scooping\n> up the dry red powder. He gobbled it, spat out a few grains of sand,\n> and immediately felt the stimulant of raw spice, a large quantity to\n> take all at once. It made him dizzy, gave him an explosion of energy.\n>\n> Finally sated, he stood at a distance from the flaccid worm, hands on\n> his hips, glaring. Then he waved his arms, shouting into the utter\n> silence, \"I defeated you, Shaitan! You meant to eat me, old crawler,\n> but I conquered you instead!\" He waved his hands again. \"Can you hear\n> me?\"\n>\n> But he detected not even a flicker. Euphoric from the melange and\n> foolishly brave, he marched back toward the long sinuous body that lay\n> on the dune crest. Only a few footsteps away, he stared up into the\n> face. Its cavernous\n>\n> mouth was studded with glittering internal thorns. The long fangs\n> looked like the tiniest of hairs in relation to the creature's immense\n> size.\n>\n> Now the dust storm approached, accompanied by skirling hot breezes.\n> The wind seized grains of sand and fragments of rock, whipping them\n> against his face like tiny darts. Gusts stole around the curved\n> carcass of the worm with a whispery, hooting sound. It seemed as if\n> the ghost of the beast was *daring him*, prodding him forward. The\n> spice thrummed in Selim's bloodstream.\n>\n> Boldly, he strode to the worm's maw and peered into the black infinity\n> of its mouth. The hellish friction-fires inside were cold; not even an\n> ember remained.\n>\n> He shouted again, \"I killed you, old crawler. I am Worm Slayer.\" The\n> sandworm did not respond even to this provocation.\n>\n> He looked up at the daggerlike fangs, curved shards that lined the\n> wide, smelly mouth. Buddallah seemed to be urging him on, or maybe it\n> was simply his own desire. Moving before common sense could catch up\n> with him, Selim climbed over the lower lip of the worm and reached the\n> nearest sharp tooth.\n>\n> The young outcast grabbed it with both hands, feeling how hard it was,\n> a material even stronger than metal. He twisted and wrenched. The\n> worm's body was soft, as if the tissues of its throat were losing\n> integrity. With a suppressed grunt, Selim uprooted the fang. It was as\n> long as his forearm, curved and pure and glistening with milky\n> whiteness. It would make an excellent knife.\n>\n> He staggered back out, holding his prize, utterly terrified at the\n> realization of what he had done. An unprecedented act, as far as he\n> knew. Who else would have risked not only riding Shaitain, but\n> stepping into its maw? His body trembled to its core. He couldn't\n> believe what he had dared--- and accomplished! No other person on all\n> of Arrakis possessed a treasure such as this tooth-knife!\n>\n> Although the remaining crystalline fangs hung down like stalactites,\n> hundreds of them that he could sell in the Arrakis City spaceport (if\n> he could ever find the place again), he felt suddenly weak. The rush\n> of the melange he'd consumed was beginning to fade.\n>\n> He scrambled backward onto the soft sand. The storm was almost on top\n> of him now, reminding him of his Zensunni desert survival training. He\n> must make his way back to the rocks and find some sort of shelter, or\n> he too would soon lie dead upon the dunes, a victim of the elements.\n>\n> But he no longer thought that would happen. *I have a destiny now, a\n> mission from Buddallah . . . if only I can understand it*.\n>\n> He backed away, then turned and ran toward the line of rocks, cradling\n> the fang in his hands. The wind nudged him onward as if anxious to get\n> him away from the carcass.\n>\n> *Humans tried to develop intelligent machines as secondary reflex\n> systems, turning over primary decisions to mechanical servants.\n> Gradually, though, the creators did not leave enough to do for\n> themselves; they began to feel alienated, dehumanized, and even\n> manipulated. Eventually humans became little more than decisionless\n> robots themselves, left without an understanding of their natural\n> existence.*\n\n--- TLALOC,\n\n*Weaknesses of the Empire*\n\n> **A**gamemnon was not eager to face Omnius. Having already lived more\n> than a thousand years, the cymek general had learned to be patient.\n>\n> As patient as a machine.\n>\n> Following their secret rendezvous near the red dwarf star, he and his\n> fellow Titans reached Corrin after an interstellar voyage of nearly\n> two months. The robotic fleet had arrived days before, delivering the\n> battle images captured by the watcheyes. The evermind already knew\n> about the defeat. All that remained was for Omnius to issue rebukes\n> and reprimands, especially to Agamemnon, who had been in command.\n>\n> As he landed his ship under the blazing giant sun of Corrin, the cymek\n> general reached out with his sensor network, accepting data through\n> his thoughtrodes. Omnius would be waiting, as always, after a mission.\n>\n> Perhaps by now the evermind would have accepted the failure.\n>\n> A false hope, Agamemnon knew. The all-pervasive computer did not react\n> in the manner of a human.\n>\n> Before emerging from his ship, the Titan general chose an efficient\n> mobile body, little more than a streamlined cart that carried his\n> brain canister and life-support systems connected to the framework.\n> The cymek moved out\n>\n> onto the paved boulevards under the enormous baleful eye of the red\n> giant.\n>\n> Harsh crimson light washed the flagstoned streets and white facades.\n>\n> Millennia ago, the bloated star had expanded, growing so large that\n> its outer layers swallowed the inner planets of the system. Corrin\n> itself had once been a frozen outlying world, but the increased heat\n> from the swollen giant now made the planet habitable.\n>\n> After the atmosphere thawed and the icy seas boiled away, Corrin's\n> landscape became a blank slate on which the Old Empire established a\n> colony during its younger, ambitious days. Most of the ecosystem had\n> been transplanted from elsewhere, but even after thousands of years\n> Corrin still seemed an *unfinished* world, missing many of the\n> ecological details necessary for a thriving planet. Omnius and his\n> independent robot Erasmus liked the place because it seemed new and\n> unburdened by the baggage of history.\n>\n> Agamemnon trundled along the streets, followed by hovering watcheyes\n> that monitored him like electronic guard dogs. With surveillance\n> monitors and speakers throughout the city, the evermind could have\n> conferred with him anywhere on Corrin. Omnius, however, insisted on\n> receiving the cymek general in a lavish central pavilion built by\n> human slave labor. This pilgrimage of contrition was part of\n> Agamemnon's penance for the Salusa failure. The powerful computer\n> understood the concept of dominance.\n>\n> The electrafluid surrounding his brain churned blue as Agamemnon\n> prepared to defend himself against a rigorous interrogation. His\n> mobile body passed under tall arches supported by scrolled white-metal\n> columns. Eccentric and earnest, the robot Erasmus had copied\n> ostentatious trappings from historical records of human empires. The\n> awesome gateway was designed to make visitors tremble, though the\n> Titan doubted Omnius cared about such things.\n>\n> The cymek general halted at the center of a courtyard where fountains\n> trickled from gaps in the walls. Tame sparrows flitted about the eaves\n> and\n>\n> nested atop the pillars. Inside terra cotta urns, scarlet lilies\n> bloomed in violent explosions of petals.\n>\n> \"I have arrived, Lord Omnius,\" Agamemnon announced through his voice\n> synthesizer--- a mere formality, because he had been closely observed\n> since emerging from his ship. He waited.\n>\n> In the echoing pavilion, the mirror-faced Erasmus was nowhere to be\n> seen. Omnius wanted to upbraid his general without the curious\n> scrutiny of the independent and annoying robot. Though Erasmus fancied\n> that he understood human emotions, Agamemnon doubted the eccentric\n> machine would show even a glimmer of compassion.\n>\n> The voice boomed from a dozen speakers in the walls, like an angry\n> deity. No doubt the effect was intentional. \"You and your cymeks have\n> failed, General.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon already knew how the discussion would play out--- as did\n> Omnius. Surely the evermind himself had run simulations. Yet, this was\n> a dance that must be continued.\n>\n> \"We fought hard, but could not achieve victory, Lord Omnius. The\n> *hrethgir* put up an unexpectedly fierce defense and were surprisingly\n> willing to sacrifice their city rather than let the shield generators\n> fall. As I have said many times, feral humans are dangerously\n> unpredictable.\"\n>\n> Omnius responded without hesitation. \"You have repeatedly insisted\n> that cymeks are far superior to the human vermin, combining the best\n> advantages of machine and man. How, then, could you be rebuffed by\n> such untrained, uncivilized creatures?\"\n>\n> \"In this instance, I was in error. The humans realized our true\n> objective faster than we had anticipated.\"\n>\n> \"Your forces did not fight hard enough,\" Omnius said.\n>\n> \"Six neo-cymeks were destroyed. The gladiator body of the Titan Xerxes\n> was demolished, and he barely escaped in a launch pod.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, but the remainder of your cymeks survived. A mere twenty-one\n> percent loss does not equate with 'fighting to your fullest.'\" Around\n> the courtyard, chirping sparrows flitted about, oblivious to the\n> tension between Omnius and his top military officer. \"You should have\n> been willing to sacrifice all your cymeks to bring down the scrambler\n> shields.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon was glad he no longer displayed human expressions, which the\n> computer mind might be able to interpret. \"Lord Omnius, cymeks are\n> irreplaceable *individuals*, unlike your robotic thinking machines. In\n> my estimation, risking the loss of your most vital Titans was not a\n> reasonable exchange for one insignificant planet infested with feral\n> humans.\"\n>\n> \"Insignificant? Before the mission you emphasized the extreme\n> importance of Salusa Secundus to the League of Nobles. You claimed\n> that its fall would precipitate a complete collapse of free humanity.\n> *You* were in command.\"\n>\n> \"But is the League itself worth the obliteration of your remaining\n> Titans? We created you, established the foundation for your\n> Synchronized Worlds. The Titans should be used for more than cannon\n> fodder.\" Agamemnon was curious as to how the evermind would respond to\n> this line of reasoning. Perhaps by setting up the Titans to fall in\n> battle against feral humans, Omnius planned to bypass the choke-hold\n> of Barbarossa's protective programming.\n>\n> \"Let me ponder that,\" Omnius said. Screens on the pavilion walls\n> projected watcheye images from the battle on Zimia. \"The *hrethgir*\n> are smarter than you presumed. They saw your target. You made an error\n> in judgment thinking your cymeks would be able to push forward\n> easily.\"\n>\n> \"I miscalculated,\" Agamemnon admitted. \"The humans have a clever\n> military commander. His unexpected decisions allowed them to mount a\n> successful resistance. Now, at least, we have tested their scrambler\n> fields.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon's explanations rapidly degenerated into a succession of\n> rationalizations and excuses. Omnius analyzed and dismissed them,\n> leaving the Titan feeling bare and humiliated.\n>\n> In the serene courtyard, bright flowers bloomed and birds sang.\n> Trickling fountains added their musical sounds . . . and Agamemnon\n> contained his outrage within himself. Even his sensitive mechanical\n> body showed no sign of agitation. A thousand years ago, he and his\n> fellow Titans had controlled these damnable thinking machines. *We\n> created you, Omnius. One day, we will also destroy you.*\n>\n> While it had taken the visionary Tlaloc and his group of rebels only a\n> few years to conquer the sleepy Old Empire, Omnius and his thinking\n> machines proved to be a far superior adversary, never sleeping, always\n> watching. But even machines made mistakes. Agamemnon just needed to\n> exploit them.\n>\n> \"Is there anything else, Lord Omnius?\" he interrupted. Further\n> arguments and excuses would serve no purpose. Above all else, machines\n> craved efficiency.\n>\n> \"Only my next set of instructions, Agamemnon.\" The Omnius voice moved\n> from speaker to speaker, giving the impression that he was everywhere\n> at once. \"I am dispatching you and your Titans back to Earth. You will\n> accompany Erasmus, who intends to continue his studies of captive\n> humans there.\"\n>\n> \"As you command, Lord Omnius.\" Though surprised, Agamemnon showed no\n> reaction. *Earth* . . . a very long journey. \"We will determine other\n> ways to destroy this blight of humanity. The Titans exist only to\n> serve you.\"\n>\n> It was one of the few advantages of Agamemnon's human side: Even\n> though the evermind was filled with a vast quantity of data, Omnius\n> did not know how to recognize a simple lie.\n>\n> *From a certain perspective, defense and offense encompass nearly\n> identical tactics.*\n\n--- XAVIER HARKONNEN,\n\nraddress to Salusan Militia\n\n> **N**ew duties, new responsibilities . . . and more good-byes. As a\n> mostly recovered Xavier Harkonnen stood with Serena Butler inside the\n> Zimia Spaceport, the departure facility seemed a sterile environment\n> with echoing plaztile floors. Even the warmth of Serena's expression\n> did not compensate for the utilitarian structure. Window walls looked\n> out onto the fused pavement where shuttles took off and landed every\n> few minutes, going to and from the larger long-distance ships that\n> waited in orbit.\n>\n> In one wing of the spaceport, work crews shored up sections of a\n> hangar damaged during the cymek attack. Large cranes lifted temporary\n> walls and braces into place. Out on the landing field, huge blast\n> craters had been filled in.\n>\n> Dressed in a crisp gold-and-black Armada uniform reflecting his new\n> grade, Xavier gazed deeply into Serena's unusual lavender eyes. He\n> knew how she saw him. His facial features were not particularly\n> striking--- ruddy complexion, pointed nose, generous lips--- but\n> overall she found him attractive, especially the soft brown eyes and\n> his infectious, though rarely used, smile.\n>\n> \"I wish we could spend more time together, Xavier.\" She fingered a\n> white rose floweret on her lapel. The spaceport drone of other people,\n> noisy repair crews and heavy machinery surrounded them.\n>\n> Xavier noticed Serena's younger sister Octa watching them. A\n> seventeen-year-old with long strawberry-blond hair, she'd always had a\n> crush on Xavier. Willowy Octa was a nice enough girl, but recently he\n> wished she would give him and Serena a little more privacy, especially\n> now that they would be apart for so long.\n>\n> \"So do I. Let's make these minutes count.\" Surrendering to the urge he\n> knew they both shared, he leaned forward to kiss her, as if his lips\n> were drawn by a magnetic force. The kiss lingered, then grew intense.\n> At last Xavier pulled back. Serena looked disappointed, more with the\n> situation than with him. They both had important duties, demands on\n> their time and energy.\n>\n> Newly installed in his position, Xavier was about to embark with a\n> group of military specialists on an inspection tour of League\n> planetary defenses. After the nearly successful cymek strike against\n> Salusa two months ago, he would make certain there were no weaknesses\n> on other League Worlds. The thinking machines would exploit the\n> tiniest flaw, and free humans could not afford to lose any of their\n> remaining strongholds.\n>\n> Serena Butler, meanwhile, would focus on expanding the League domain.\n> After the battlefield surgeons had been so successful with the fresh\n> tank-grown organs provided by Tuk Keedair, Serena had spoken\n> passionately about the services and resources the Unallied Planets\n> such as Tlulaxa could provide. She wanted them to formally join the\n> union of free humans.\n>\n> Already, more flesh merchants had arrived on Salusa with their\n> biological wares; previously, many nobles and League citizens had been\n> uneasy about the mysterious outsiders, but now that the war-wounded\n> faced terrible losses of limbs and organs, they were willing to accept\n> cloned replacement parts. The Tlulaxa never explained where they had\n> developed or obtained such sophisticated biological technology, but\n> Serena praised their generosity and resources.\n>\n> At any other time, her speech in the Hall of Parliament might have\n> been forgotten, but the cymek attack had underscored her point about\n> the vulnerability of the Unallied Planets. What if the machines next\n> chose to wipe out the Thalim system and thereby eliminate the Tlulaxan\n> ability to give sight to blind veterans, new limbs to amputees?\n>\n> She had studied hundreds of survey documents and ambassadorial\n> reports, trying to determine which of the nonsignatory planets were\n> the best\n>\n> candidates for induction into the League brotherhood. Unifying the\n> remnants of humanity had become her passion, to make the free people\n> strong enough to put down any machine aggression.\n>\n> Despite her youth, she had already led two successful aid missions,\n> the first when she was only seventeen. In one she had taken food and\n> medical supplies to refugees from an abandoned Synchronized World, and\n> in the other she had provided relief for a biological blight that\n> almost destroyed the pristine farms on Poritrin.\n>\n> Neither she nor Xavier had time for themselves.\n>\n> \"When you return, I promise I will make it up to you,\" she said, her\n> eyes dancing. \"I'll give you a banquet of kisses.\"\n>\n> He allowed himself a rare laugh. \"Then I plan to arrive very hungry\n> indeed!\" Xavier took her hand and kissed it gallantly. \"When we dine\n> again, I shall come calling with flowers.\" He knew their next\n> rendezvous could be months away.\n>\n> She gave him a warm smile. \"I have a particular fondness for flowers.\"\n>\n> He was about to pull Serena close, but they were interrupted by a\n> familiar brown-skinned child coming from another direction--- Xavier's\n> eight-year-old brother, Vergyl Tantor. The boy had been permitted to\n> leave school to see him off. Breaking free of an elderly instructor\n> escort, Vergyl ran to hug his idol, nuzzling his face into the crisp\n> uniform shirt.\n>\n> \"Take care of our estate while I am gone, little brother,\" Xavier\n> said, playfully rubbing his knuckles on the boy's wiry hair. \"You are\n> in charge of tending my wolfhounds--- you understand?\"\n>\n> The boy's brown eyes widened, and he nodded gravely. \"Yes.\"\n>\n> \"And obey your parents, otherwise you can't hope to grow up to become\n> a good officer in the Armada.\"\n>\n> \"I will!\"\n>\n> An announcement summoned the inspection team to board the shuttle.\n> Hearing it, Xavier promised to bring something back for Vergyl, Octa,\n> and Serena. While Octa watched from a distance, smiling hopefully, he\n> hugged his little brother again, squeezed Serena's hand, and strode\n> off with the officers and engineers.\n>\n> Staring at the window wall where they could watch the waiting military\n> shuttle, Serena glanced down at the boy and thought of Xavier\n> Harkonnen. Xavier had been only six years old when thinking machines\n> had killed his natural parents and his older brother.\n>\n> Because of interfamily agreements and the written wills of Ulf and\n> Katarina Harkonnen, young Xavier had been raised as the foster son of\n> powerful and then-childless Emil and Lucille Tantor. The noble couple\n> had already made arrangements for their holdings to be administered by\n> Tantor relatives, distant cousins and nephews who would not normally\n> have inherited anything. But when Emil Tantor began to raise Xavier,\n> he was quite taken with the orphan and legally adopted him, though\n> Xavier retained his Harkonnen name and all associated noble rights.\n>\n> After the adoption, Lucille Tantor unexpectedly conceived a son,\n> Vergyl, who was twelve years younger than Xavier. The Harkonnen heir,\n> not worried about dynastic politics, concentrated on a course of\n> military studies, intending to join the League Armada. At the age of\n> eighteen Xavier received the legal entitlement to the original\n> Harkonnen holdings, and a year later he became an officer in the\n> Salusan Militia. With his impeccable performance and rapid promotions,\n> everyone could see Xavier was a rising star in the military ranks.\n>\n> Now three people who cared about him watched the shuttle lift into the\n> sky on a plume of orange exhaust. Vergyl held Serena's hand, bravely\n> trying to comfort her. \"Xavier will be all right. You can count on\n> him.\"\n>\n> She felt a pang for her departing love, but smiled warmly at the\n> wide-eyed boy. \"Of course we can.\"\n>\n> She would have it no other way. Love was one of the things that\n> separated humans from machines.\n>\n> *The answer is a mirror of the question.*\n\n--- COGITOR KWYNA,\n\nCity of Introspection archives\n\n> **T**he temporary meeting chamber for the League delegates had\n> originally been the home of the first Viceroy, Bovko Manresa. Before\n> the Titans had taken over the weak Old Empire, Manresa had built the\n> mansion on then-isolated Salusa Secundus as a way of celebrating\n> wealth garnered from his planetary land dealings. Later, when refugee\n> humans began arriving, driven out by the cruel rule of the Twenty\n> Titans, the big house had become a meeting hall, with chairs and a\n> lectern set up in the grand ballroom, as they were today.\n>\n> Months ago, within hours of the cymek attack, Viceroy Butler had stood\n> on a pile of rubble beneath the broken central dome of the Hall of\n> Parliament. While the poisonous dust settled in the streets and fires\n> still blazed in damaged buildings, he had vowed to repair the\n> venerable old facility that had served the League for centuries.\n>\n> The governmental edifice was more than just a building: It was\n> hallowed ground on which legendary leaders had debated great ideas and\n> formulated plans against the machines. The damage to the roof and\n> upper floors was severe, but the basic structure remained sound. Just\n> like the human spirit it represented.\n>\n> It was a frosty morning outside, with fog on the windows. Leaves on\n> the hills had begun to turn lovely autumn shades of yellow, orange,\n> and brown. Serena and the representatives came inside the temporary\n> meeting hall, still clinging to their coats.\n>\n> She gazed at the walls of the crowded old ballroom, at paintings of\n> long-dead leaders and depictions of past victories. She wondered what\n> the future would bring, and what her place might be in it. She wanted\n> so badly to *do* something, to help in the great crusade of humankind.\n>\n> Most of her life she had been an activist, always willing to get her\n> hands dirty, to assist in aiding the victims of other tragedies such\n> as natural disasters or machine attacks. Even during pleasant times,\n> she had joined the work crews of harvesters to pick grapes from the\n> Butler estate vineyards or olives from the gnarled groves.\n>\n> She took a seat in the first row, then watched as her soft-featured\n> father made his way across the wood parquet floor to the antique\n> lectern. Viceroy Butler was followed by a monk in a red-velvet tunic\n> carrying a large plexiplaz container that held a living human brain in\n> viscous electrafluid. The monk lovingly placed the container on an\n> ornate table beside the lectern, then stood beside it.\n>\n> From her front-row seat, Serena saw the pinkish gray tissue undulate\n> slightly within the pale-blue life-support liquid. Separated from the\n> senses and distractions of the physical world for more than a\n> millennium, stimulated by constant intense contemplation, the female\n> Cogitor's once-human brain had grown larger than its original size.\n>\n> \"The Cogitor Kwyna does not often leave the City of Introspection,\"\n> Viceroy Butler said, sounding both formal and excited. \"But in these\n> times we require the best thoughts and advice. If any mind can\n> understand the thinking machines, it will be Kwyna's.\"\n>\n> These esoteric disembodied philosophers were seen so infrequently that\n> many League representatives did not understand how they managed to\n> communicate. Compounding the mystery that surrounded them, Cogitors\n> rarely said much, choosing instead to marshall their energies and\n> contribute only the most important thoughts.\n>\n> \"The Cogitor's Secondary will speak for Kwyna,\" the Viceroy said, \"if\n> she has any insights to offer.\"\n>\n> Beside the brain canister, the red-robed monk removed the sealed lid,\n> exposing the agitated viscous fluid. Blinking his round eyes rapidly,\n> he stared into the tank. Slowly, the monk slid one naked hand into the\n> soup, immersing his fingers. He closed his eyes, drawing deep breaths,\n> as he\n>\n> tentatively touched the convoluted brain. His brows furrowed with\n> concentration and acceptance as the electrafluid soaked into his\n> pores, linking the Cogitor with the Secondary's neural system, using\n> him as an extension in much the same way cymeks used artificial\n> mechanical bodies.\n>\n> \"I understand nothing,\" said the monk in a strange, distant voice.\n> Serena knew that was the first principle the Cogitors adopted, and the\n> contemplative brains spent centuries in deep study, adding to that\n> sense of nothingness.\n>\n> Centuries before the original Titans, a group of spiritual humans had\n> enjoyed studying philosophy and discussing esoteric issues, but too\n> many frailties and temptations of the flesh inhibited their ability to\n> concentrate. In the ennui of the Old Empire, these metaphysical\n> scholars had been the first to have their brains installed in\n> life-support systems. Freed of biological constraints, they spent all\n> their time learning and thinking. Each Cogitor wanted to study the\n> entirety of human philosophy, bringing together the ingredients to\n> understand the universe. They lived in ivory towers and contemplated,\n> rarely bothering to note the superficial relationships and events of\n> the mundane world.\n>\n> Kwyna, the two-thousand-year-old Cogitor who resided in Salusa's City\n> of Introspection, claimed to be politically neutral. \"I am ready to\n> interact,\" she announced through the monk, who stared with glazed eyes\n> at the assembly. \"You may begin.\"\n>\n> With intense blue eyes, Viceroy Butler gazed around the packed\n> ballroom, pausing to look at a number of faces, including Serena's.\n> \"My friends, we have always lived under the threat of annihilation,\n> and now I must ask every one of you to devote your time, energies, and\n> money to our cause.\"\n>\n> He gave tribute to the tens of thousands of Salusans who had died in\n> the cymek onslaught, along with fifty-one visiting dignitaries. \"The\n> Salusan Militia remains on full alert here, and messenger ships have\n> been dispatched to all League Worlds, warning them of the danger. We\n> can only hope that no other planets were attacked.\"\n>\n> The Viceroy then called upon Tio Holtzman, recently arrived after\n> nearly a month in transit from his laboratories on Poritrin. \"Savant\n> Holtzman, we are anxious to hear your assessment of the new defenses.\"\n>\n> Holtzman had been eager to inspect his orbital scrambler fields, to\n> see how they might be modified and improved. On Poritrin, the\n> flamboyant nobleman Niko Bludd funded the Savant's research. Given his\n> past accomplishments, League members always held out the hope that\n> Holtzman would pull some other miracle out of his pocket.\n>\n> Slight of body, Holtzman moved with grace and an enormous stage\n> presence, wearing clean and stylish robes. The iron gray hair that\n> hung to his shoulders was square-cut, framing a narrow face. A man of\n> immense confidence and ego, he loved to speak to important dignitaries\n> in the Parliament, but now he appeared uncharacteristically troubled.\n> In truth, the inventor could not bring himself to admit a mistake.\n> Unquestionably, his scrambler network had failed. The cymeks had\n> broken through! What would he say to these people who had relied on\n> him?\n>\n> Reaching the speaking platform, the great man cleared his throat and\n> looked around, glancing oddly at the imposing presence of the Cogitor\n> and the looming attendant monk. This was a most delicate matter. How\n> could he shift the blame from himself?\n>\n> The scientist used his best voice. \"In warfare, whenever one side\n> makes a technological breakthrough, the other attempts to top it. We\n> recently witnessed this with my atmospheric scrambler fields. Had they\n> not been installed here, the full thinking machine fleet would have\n> laid waste to Salusa. Unfortunately, I did not factor in the unique\n> abilities of the cymeks. They found a chink in the armor and\n> penetrated it.\"\n>\n> No one had accused him of lax work or poor planning, but this was the\n> closest Holtzman would come to admitting that he had overlooked a\n> major flaw. \"Now it is our turn to surpass the machines with a new\n> concept. I hope to be inspired by this tragedy, pushing my creativity\n> to its limits.\" He then\n>\n> stalled and looked embarrassed, even endearing. \"I'll be working on\n> that, as soon as I get back to Poritrin. I hope to have a surprise for\n> you very soon.\"\n>\n> A tall, statuesque woman glided toward the lectern, drawing attention\n> to herself. \"Perhaps I have a suggestion.\" She had pale eyebrows,\n> white hair, and luminous skin that made her seem ethereal, but charged\n> with power.\n>\n> \"Let us hear from the women of Rossak. I gladly yield to Zufa Cenva.\"\n> Looking relieved, Holtzman hurried back to his seat and slumped into\n> it.\n>\n> The pale woman carried an air of mystery about her; she wore glowing\n> jewelry on a black, diaphanous gown that revealed much of her perfect\n> body. Pausing at the Cogitor's life-support case, Zufa Cenva peered\n> inside at the enlarged brain. Her brow furrowed as she concentrated,\n> and as she did so, the brain itself seemed to vibrate; the\n> electrafluid swirled, bubbles formed. Alarmed, the devout attendant\n> monk withdrew his hand from the liquid.\n>\n> The tall woman relaxed, satisfied, and stepped to the podium. \"Because\n> of oddities in our environment, many of the females born on Rossak\n> exhibit enhanced telepathic abilities.\" Indeed, the powerful\n> Sorceresses of the dense, barely habitable jungles had parlayed their\n> mental quirks into political influence. Rossak men exhibited no such\n> telepathic enhancements.\n>\n> \"The League of Nobles was formed a thousand years ago for our mutual\n> defense, first against the Titans and then against Omnius. Since then,\n> we have barricaded ourselves, trying to protect our worlds from the\n> enemy.\" Her eyes flashed like highly polished stones. \"We need to\n> rethink this strategy. Perhaps it is time for *us* to take the\n> offensive against the Synchronized Worlds. Otherwise, Omnius and his\n> minions will never leave us alone.\"\n>\n> The League representatives muttered at this, looking fearful,\n> especially after the devastation Zimia had just endured. The Viceroy\n> was first to respond. \"That is a bit premature, Madame Cenva. I'm not\n> sure we have the capability.\"\n>\n> \"We barely survived the last attack!\" a man shouted. \"And we had only\n> a handful of cymeks to contend with.\"\n>\n> Manion Butler looked deeply concerned. \"Confronting Omnius would be a\n> suicide mission. What weapons would we use?\"\n>\n> In response, the imposing woman squared her shoulders and spread her\n> hands, while closing her eyes and concentrating. Although Zufa was\n> known to have extrasensory powers, she had never before displayed them\n> in Parliament. Her milky pale skin seemed to heat up with an inner\n> light. The air in the enclosed chamber stirred, and static electricity\n> crackled around the assemblage, making hair stand on end.\n>\n> Lightning flickered at her fingertips, as if she were holding a barely\n> contained thunderstorm inside herself. Her own white hair coiled and\n> writhed like snakes. When Zufa's eyes opened again, a dazzling energy\n> seemed ready to shoot out of them, as if the universe lived behind her\n> pupils.\n>\n> Gasps echoed through the delegates. Serena's skin crawled and her\n> scalp tingled, as if a thousand poisonous spiders skittered over her\n> mind. In her preservation tank, the Cogitor Kwyna churned.\n>\n> Then Zufa relaxed, throttling back the chain reaction of mental\n> energy. Letting out a long, cold breath, the Sorceress smiled grimly\n> at the startled onlookers. \"*We* have a weapon.\"\n>\n> *The eyes of common perception do not see far. Too often we make the\n> most important decisions based only on superficial information.*\n>\n> --- NORMA CENVA,\n\nunpublished laboratory notebooks\n\n> **A**fter delivering her announcement to the League assembly, Zufa\n> Cenva returned to Rossak. She had been in transit for weeks, and her\n> shuttle now landed on a dense section of the jungle canopy that had\n> been paved over with a polymer to seal and fuse the branches and\n> leaves into a solid mass. To enable the trees to receive adequate\n> moisture and gas exchange, the polymer was porous, synthesized from\n> jungle chemicals and organics.\n>\n> Toxic oceans made the native Rossak planktons, fish, kelp, and sea\n> creatures poisonous to humans. Rugged, sterile lava plains covered\n> much of the planet's land area, dotted with geysers and brimstone\n> lakes. Since the botanical chemistry did not rely on chlorophyll, the\n> general cast of all plants was silvery purple; nothing here was fresh\n> and green.\n>\n> In a tectonically stable zone girdling the equator, large rifts in the\n> continental plate created broad sanctuary valleys where the water was\n> filtered and the air breathable. In these protected rift ecosystems,\n> hardy human settlers had constructed sophisticated cave-cities like\n> hives tunneled into the black cliffs. The declivitous external walls\n> were overgrown with silvery-purple vines, drooping ferns, and fleshy\n> moss. Comfortable chambers looked out upon a thick jungle canopy that\n> pressed against the settlement cliffs. People could venture directly\n> onto the upper rubbery branches and descend to the dense underbrush,\n> where they harvested edibles.\n>\n> As if to make up for the dearth of life elsewhere on Rossak, the rift\n> valleys teemed with aggressive living things--- mushrooms, lichens,\n> berries, flowers, orchidlike parasites, and insects. The Rossak men,\n> lacking the telepathic enhancement of their women, had turned their\n> talents to developing and extracting drugs, pharmaceuticals, and\n> occasional poisons\n>\n> from nature's larder. The entire place was like a Pandora's box that\n> had been opened only a crack. . . .\n>\n> Now the tall, luminous Sorceress watched as her much younger paramour,\n> Aurelius Venport, crossed a suspended bridge from the open cliffs to\n> the foamy purple treetops. His patrician features were handsome, his\n> dark hair curly, his face long and lean. Tagging along behind him on\n> stubby legs came Zufa's disappointing fifteen-year-old daughter by a\n> prior relationship.\n>\n> *Two misfits. No wonder they get along so well*.\n>\n> Prior to seducing Aurelius Venport, the chief Sorceress had arranged\n> conjugal relationships with four other men during her peak breeding\n> times, selecting them for their proven bloodlines. After generations\n> of research, miserable miscarriages, and defective offspring, the\n> women of Rossak had compiled detailed genetic indices of various\n> families. Because of heavy environmental toxins and teratogens, the\n> odds were against any child being born strong and healthy. But for\n> every stillborn monster or talentless male, a miraculous pale-skinned\n> Sorceress might occur. Each time a woman conceived a child, it was\n> like playing a game of roulette. Genetics was never an exact science.\n>\n> But Zufa had been so careful, checking and double-checking the\n> bloodlines. Only one of those conjugal encounters had resulted in a\n> living child--- Norma, a dwarf barely four feet tall, with blocky\n> features, mousy brown hair, and a tedious, bookish personality.\n>\n> Many offspring on Rossak had defective bodies, and even the apparently\n> healthy ones rarely exhibited the strong mental powers of the elite\n> Sorceresses. Nevertheless, Zufa felt deep disappointment, even\n> embarrassment, that *her* daughter had no telepathic skills. The\n> greatest living Sorceress should have been able to pass along her\n> superior mental abilities, and she desperately wanted her daughter to\n> carry on the fight against the machines. But Norma showed no potential\n> whatsoever. And despite Aurelius Venport's impeccable genetic\n> credentials, Zufa had never been able to carry one of his babies to\n> term.\n>\n> *How many more times must I keep trying before I replace him with\n> another breeder?* Once more, she decided--- she would attempt to get\n> pregnant again, within the next few months. It would be Venport's last\n> chance.\n>\n> Zufa was also disappointed in Norma's independence and defiance. Too\n> often the teenager spun off on obscure mathematical tangents that no\n> one could comprehend. Norma seemed lost in her own world.\n>\n> *My daughter, you should have been so much more!*\n>\n> No one had a heavier burden of responsibility than the small clan of\n> Sorceresses on the planet, and Zufa's burden was the greatest of all.\n> If only she could count on everyone else, especially in light of this\n> latest danger from the cymeks.\n>\n> Since stunted Norma could never take part in the mental battle, Zufa\n> had to concentrate on her daughters in spirit, those few young women\n> who had won the \"genetic lottery\" and acquired superior mental\n> abilities. Zufa would train and encourage them, showing them how to\n> eradicate the enemy.\n>\n> From her cliffside perch, she watched her lover Aurelius and young\n> Norma reach the other side of the suspension bridge and begin to\n> negotiate a circular network of ladders that led to the deeply\n> shadowed jungle floor. Like two happy-go-lucky outcasts, Norma and\n> Aurelius had grown close emotionally, using one another as crutches.\n>\n> Engrossed in their own petty concerns that had nothing to do with\n> victory, neither of them had even noticed Zufa's return on the\n> shuttle. No doubt the two misfits would spend hours poking through the\n> foliage in search of new drug resources, which Aurelius would\n> incorporate into his business ventures.\n>\n> The Sorceress shook her head, not understanding his priorities. Those\n> drugs the men developed were of little more use than Norma's arcane\n> mathematics. Admittedly, Aurelius was a highly intelligent and skilled\n> businessman, but what good were enormous profits if free humanity was\n> doomed to enslavement?\n>\n> Disappointed in both of them, knowing that she and her Sorceresses\n> would have to do the real fighting, Zufa set out to find the most\n> powerful young women she had recruited to learn the devastating new\n> technique she planned to unleash against the cymeks.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AS NORMA FOLLOWED him through the fleshy underbrush, Aurelius consumed\n> capsules of a focused stimulant that his expert chemists had\n> synthesized from the pungent pheromones of a boulder-sized burrowing\n> beetle. Venport felt stronger, his perceptions sharpened, his reflexes\n> enhanced. Not quite like the telepathic powers of icy Zufa, but better\n> than his natural abilities.\n>\n> Someday he would make a breakthrough, allowing him to meet the\n> powerful Sorceress on his own terms. Maybe he and Norma would do it\n> together.\n>\n> Aurelius maintained a benign fondness for the girl's stern mother. He\n> tolerated Zufa's moods and scornful attitude with good grace; Rossak\n> women rarely allowed themselves the luxury of romantic love.\n>\n> Though Aurelius knew full well that Zufa had selected him for his\n> breeding potential, he saw through the woman's stoic, demanding\n> exterior. Attempting to conceal her weaknesses, the powerful Sorceress\n> showed her doubts on occasion, afraid that she could not fulfill the\n> responsibilities she had placed on herself. Once, when Aurelius\n> commented that he knew how strong she was trying to be, Zufa had grown\n> embarrassed and angry. \"Somebody has to be strong\" was all she had\n> said.\n>\n> Since he lacked telepathic ability, Zufa had little interest in\n> engaging him in conversation. Perhaps she recognized his skills as a\n> businessman, investor, and politician, but she valued none of those\n> abilities as much as her own narrow goals. The Sorceress frequently\n> tried to make him feel like a failure, but her derision only served to\n> ignite his ambition, especially his desire to find a drug that would\n> give him telepathic powers equivalent to her own.\n>\n> There were other ways to fight a war.\n>\n> The silvery-purple jungles offered a treasure-trove to cure diseases,\n> expand the mind, and improve human abilities. The choices were\n> overwhelming, but Aurelius sought to investigate everything. From\n> proper development and marketing, the products of Rossak had already\n> put him on the path to great wealth. He was even grudgingly respected\n> by a number of the Sorceresses--- except by his own mate.\n>\n> As a visionary entrepreneur, he was accustomed to exploring\n> alternatives. Like paths through a dense jungle, many routes could\n> lead to the same place. Sometimes, one just had to hack through with a\n> machete.\n>\n> So far, though, the right drug eluded him.\n>\n> In another venture, he had proudly distributed Norma's exotic\n> mathematical work among scholarly scientific circles. Though he didn't\n> understand her theorems, he had a gut feeling that she might come up\n> with something important. Maybe she had already done so, and it took\n> expert eyes to recognize it. Venport liked the intense girl, acting as\n> a big brother to her. As far as he was concerned, Norma was a\n> mathematical prodigy, so who cared about her height or her appearance?\n> He was willing to give her a chance, even if her mother never would.\n>\n> Beside him, Norma studied the design of a broad purple leaf, using a\n> light-beam caliper to measure its various dimensions and the\n> relationships among angles in the sap-filled veins. The depth of her\n> concentration added a wistful cast to her plain features.\n>\n> Glancing back at him, Norma said in a surprisingly mature voice, \"This\n> leaf has been designed and constructed by the Earth mother Gaia, or\n> the Master Creator God, or Buddallah, or whatever you want to call\n> it.\" With blunt fingers, she held up the fleshy leaf and passed a beam\n> of light through it, so that the intricate cellular designs showed\n> clearly. \"Patterns within patterns, all tied together in complex\n> relationships.\"\n>\n> In his drug-enhanced, euphoric state, Aurelius found the design\n> hypnotic. \"God is in everything,\" he said. The stimulant he had taken\n> seemed to supercharge his synapses. He squinted through the\n> illuminated fabric of the leaf as she pointed to the internal shapes.\n>\n> \"God is the mathematician of the universe. There is an ancient\n> correlation known as the Golden Mean, a pleasing ratio of form and\n> structure that is found in this leaf, in seashells, and in the living\n> creatures of many planets. It is the tiniest part of the key, known\n> since the time of the Greeks and Egyptians of Earth. They used it in\n> their architecture and pyramids, in their Pythagorean pentagram and\n> Fibonacci sequence.\" She discarded the leaf. \"But there is so much\n> more.\"\n>\n> Nodding, Venport touched a moistened fingertip to a pouch of fine\n> black powder at his belt; he rubbed the powder under the sensitive\n> tissue of his tongue and felt another drug penetrating his senses,\n> merging with the remnants of the last one. Norma kept talking; though\n> he did not follow her logical development, he was certain the\n> revelations must be fabulous.\n>\n> \"Give me a practical example,\" he slurred. \"Something with a function\n> that I can understand.\"\n>\n> He had grown accustomed to Norma spouting off obscure formulations.\n> Her basis might have been in classical geometry, but she applied her\n> knowledge in much more complex ways. \"I can envision calculations all\n> the way to infinity,\" she said, as if in a trance. \"I don't have to\n> write them down.\"\n>\n> *And she doesn't even need mind-enhancement drugs to accomplish it,*\n> Aurelius marveled.\n>\n> \"At this very moment I envision a huge and efficient structure that\n> could be built at a reasonable cost, tens of kilometers long--- and\n> based upon the ratio of the Golden Mean.\"\n>\n> \"But who would ever need something so immense?\"\n>\n> \"I cannot peer into the future, Aurelius.\" Norma teased him. Then they\n> trudged deeper into the weird jungle, still curious and intent on what\n> they might discover. Norma's face was radiant with energy. \"But there\n> might be something . . . something I haven't thought of yet.\"\n>\n> *Careful preparations and defenses can never guarantee* *victory.*\n>\n> *However, ignoring these precautions is an almost certain recipe for\n> defeat.*\n>\n> ---*League Armada Strategy Manual*\n>\n> **F**or four months, Tercero Xavier Harkonnen and his six Armada\n> survey vessels traveled along a predetermined route, stopping to\n> inspect and assess the military facilities and defensive preparations\n> of the League Worlds. After many years of no more than a few\n> skirmishes, no one knew where Omnius might strike next.\n>\n> Xavier had never wavered from the difficult decision he'd made during\n> the cymek attack on Zimia. The Viceroy had praised him for his nerve\n> and determination; even so, Manion Butler had wisely sent the young\n> officer away during the major rebuilding activities, giving Salusans\n> time to heal their wounds without looking for a scapegoat.\n>\n> Xavier listened to no excuses from tightwad nobles unwilling to commit\n> the necessary resources. No expense must be spared. Any free world\n> that fell to machine aggression would be a loss for the entire human\n> race.\n>\n> The survey ships traveled from the mines of Hagal to the broad river\n> plains of Poritrin, then made their way to Seneca where the weather\n> was poor and the rain so corrosive that even thinking machines would\n> break down soon after a conquest.\n>\n> The League planets of Relicon followed, then Kirana III, then Richese,\n> with its burgeoning high-tech industries that made so many other\n> League noblemen uneasy. In theory, the sophisticated manufacturing\n> devices contained no computerization or artificial intelligence, but\n> there were always questions, always doubts.\n>\n> Finally Xavier's team arrived at their final inspection stop, Giedi\n> Prime. At last, his tour was about to end. He could return home, see\n> Serena again, and they could make good on their promises to each\n> other. . . .\n>\n> All other League Worlds had installed scrambler field towers. The\n> shields' known weakness against cymeks did not completely devalue\n> Holtzman's ingenious work, and the costly barriers still provided\n> substantial protection against all-out thinking machine offensives. In\n> addition, every human world had long ago built up enormous stockpiles\n> of atomics as part of a doomsday defense. With so many nuclear\n> warheads, an iron-willed planetary governor could turn his world into\n> slag rather than allowing it to fall to Omnius.\n>\n> Although the thinking machines also had access to atomics, Omnius had\n> concluded that atomics were an inefficient and nonselective way to\n> impose control, and radioactive cleanup afterward was difficult.\n> Besides, with unlimited resources and a deep reservoir of patience,\n> the relentless evermind had no need of such weapons.\n>\n> Now, as Xavier disembarked from the lead survey ship at the Giedi City\n> spaceport, he blinked under bright sunlight. The well-maintained\n> metropolis sprawled in front of him, with its habitation complexes and\n> productive industrial buildings amid manicured parks and canals. The\n> colors were bright and fresh, and flowers bloomed in ornate beds,\n> although with his new Tlulaxa lungs and tissues he could smell only a\n> hint of the most potent scents, even when he breathed deeply.\n>\n> \"This would be a fine place to bring Serena one day,\" he said\n> wistfully as he stood in the heat-shimmer of spaceship exhaust. If he\n> married her, perhaps this would be a suitable world for their\n> honeymoon. During the current inspection tour, he had kept his eyes\n> open, trying to find a likely spot.\n>\n> After four months in space, Xavier missed Serena terribly. He knew the\n> two of them were destined for each other. His life operated on a\n> smooth, clearly defined path. When he returned to Salusa, he promised\n> himself that he would formalize their betrothal. He saw no point in\n> waiting any longer.\n>\n> Viceroy Butler already treated him like a son, and the young officer\n> had received the blessing of his adoptive father Emil Tantor. As far\n> as Xavier\n>\n> could determine, everyone in the League agreed it would be a fine\n> joining of noble houses.\n>\n> He smiled, thinking of Serena's face, of her intriguing lavender eyes\n> . . . and then looked across the landing field to see Magnus Sumi\n> approaching the survey ships. The elected leader was accompanied by a\n> dozen members of the Giedi Prime Home Guard.\n>\n> The Magnus was a thin man in late middle age with pale skin and\n> gray-blond hair that hung to his shoulders. Sumi raised a hand. \"Ah,\n> Tercero Harkonnen! We welcome the League Armada and are eager to see\n> how Giedi Prime can improve its defenses against the thinking\n> machines.\"\n>\n> Xavier snapped a stiff bow in return. \"Your cooperation pleases me,\n> Eminence. Against Omnius, we must not use low-cost materials or\n> stopgap systems that would not adequately protect your people.\"\n>\n> After the Battle of Zimia, Xavier's corps of engineers had made\n> requests for mandatory strategic improvements throughout the League.\n> The nobles dug into their coffers, increasing taxes on their subjects\n> and spending the necessary money to build up their defenses. At each\n> stop, planet after planet, month after month, Xavier had assigned\n> teams of engineers and Armada troops where he deemed they were most\n> needed.\n>\n> Soon, though, he would be going back home. *Soon*. As the time drew\n> near, he thought of Serena more and more.\n>\n> Well dressed and well armed, the Home Guard stood at attention around\n> the survey ships. Magnus Sumi gestured for Xavier to follow him. \"I\n> look forward to clarifying everything over a sumptuous banquet,\n> Tercero Harkonnen. I've set up twelve fine courses with dancers,\n> musicians, and our best poets. You and I can relax in my government\n> residence while we discuss plans. I am certain you must be weary from\n> your journey. How long can you stay with us?\"\n>\n> Xavier could form only a tight smile, thinking of how far away he was\n> from Salusa Secundus. Even after leaving Giedi Prime, the ships would\n> still need\n>\n> another month of fast space travel to return home. The sooner he\n> departed here, the sooner he could hold Serena in his arms again.\n>\n> \"Eminence, this is the final stop on our long tour. If it pleases you,\n> I would prefer to spend less time with festivities and more on the\n> inspection.\" He gestured toward his survey ship. \"We have a schedule\n> to keep. I'm afraid I can allot only two days for Giedi Prime. It is\n> best that we concentrate on our work.\"\n>\n> The Magnus looked crestfallen. \"Yes, I suppose celebration is not\n> appropriate after the damage done to Salusa Secundus.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> FOR TWO DAYS, Xavier gave the planetary defenses a quick, almost\n> cursory inspection. He found Giedi Prime to be a dazzling and\n> prosperous world with many resources, perhaps even a suitable place to\n> settle down and start an estate of his own one day.\n>\n> He gave a favorable assessment, accompanied by a warning. \"This is\n> undoubtedly a planet the thinking machines will want to conquer,\n> Eminence.\" He studied the city blueprints and the distribution of\n> resources across the main continents. \"Any cymek attack would most\n> likely attempt to keep the industries intact so that robots could\n> exploit them. Omnius preaches efficiency.\"\n>\n> Beside him, Magnus Sumi reacted with pride. He pointed out substations\n> on the diagrams. \"We intend to install secondary field-transmitting\n> towers at several strategic points.\" As he spoke, highlights appeared\n> on the blueprint screen. \"We have already built a completely redundant\n> transmitting station on one of the uninhabited islands in the northern\n> sea, which can provide full overlap from a polar projection. We hope\n> to have it online within another month.\"\n>\n> Xavier nodded distractedly, his mind weary from months of such\n> details. \"I am glad to hear that, though I doubt a second transmitting\n> complex is entirely necessary.\"\n>\n> \"We want to feel safe, Tercero.\"\n>\n> When the two men stood under silvery parabolic towers that throbbed\n> into the sky over Giedi City, Xavier paced around the plascrete\n> embankments that blocked access to large vehicles. He had no doubt a\n> cymek warrior could easily crash through.\n>\n> \"Eminence, I suggest you station more ground troops and obstacles\n> here. Increase your planetside missile-defense batteries to protect\n> against any intrusion from space. On Salusa, the cymek strategy was to\n> focus their entire attack on the destruction of the towers, and they\n> might try that again.\" He rapped his knuckles against the tower's\n> heavy paristeel support pillar. \"These shields are your first and last\n> line of defense, your most effective blockade against thinking\n> machines. Do not neglect them.\"\n>\n> \"Indeed. Our munitions factories are building heavy artillery and\n> armored ground vehicles. As soon as possible, we intend to surround\n> this complex with a large concentration of military power.\"\n>\n> As for the uncompleted secondary generating station, it was too\n> isolated to be protected from a massive assault. But its existence\n> seemed to comfort the Magnus and his populace.\n>\n> \"Very good,\" Xavier said, then glanced at the chronometer on his\n> wrist. Everything was going so well, perhaps his survey ships could\n> depart before sunset. . . .\n>\n> The Magnus continued, his voice uncertain, \"Tercero, are you concerned\n> about Giedi Prime's limited space military defenses? Our Home Guard\n> has few large ships in orbit to drive back an approaching machine\n> fleet, and our picket ships and scouts are minimal. I admit to feeling\n> vulnerable in that area.

No quantity of Armada battleships can match the deterrent\n> power of scrambler\n>\n> shields. When the robot fleet attacking Salusa realized they could not\n> take down the scramblers, they retreated.\"\n>\n> \"But what if they blockade Giedi Prime from orbit?\"\n>\n> \"Your world is self-sufficient enough to wait out any siege until the\n> arrival of a League rescue force.\" Anxious to be back at the\n> spaceport, Xavier decided to appease the governor. \"Nevertheless, I\n> will recommend that a javelin-class destroyer or two be stationed\n> around Giedi Prime.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THAT EVENING, THE Magnus threw a departure banquet for the Armada\n> service performed on his behalf. \"Someday,\" he said, \"we may all thank\n> you for our lives.\"\n>\n> Xavier excused himself midway through the meal. The food and wine\n> seemed to lack taste. \"My apologies, Eminence, but my squadron must\n> not miss the optimal departure window.\" He bowed at the doorway, then\n> hurried to his vessel. Some of his troops would have liked to remain\n> longer, but most were also eager to get home. They had their own\n> sweethearts and families, and these soldiers had more than earned\n> furloughs.\n>\n> With his inspection tour behind him, Xavier left lovely Giedi Prime,\n> confident that he had seen and done everything necessary.\n>\n> And completely unaware of the vulnerabilities he had not bothered to\n> discover. . . .\n>\n> *In the process of becoming slaves to machines, we transferred\n> technical knowledge to them--- without imparting proper value\n> systems.*\n\n--- PRIMERO FAYKAN BUTLER,\n\n*Memoirs of the Jihad*\n\n> **T**he *Dream Voyager* neared Earth, humanity's original home and now\n> the central Synchronized World. Though he remained attentive, Seurat\n> allowed Vorian Atreides to pilot the ship. \"Such risks amuse me.\"\n>\n> Vor sniffed, looking at the unreadable expression on the copper\n> skinfilm of the cognizant machine. \"I've proved myself to be a\n> perfectly competent pilot--- probably the best of all the trustees.\"\n>\n> \"For a human, I suppose, with sluggish reflexes and the frailties of a\n> physical body prone to infirmities.\"\n>\n> \"At least my jokes are better than yours.\" Vor took the controls of\n> the black-and-silver ship.

A circle has no end.\"\n>\n> \"Earth-Omnius is the beginning and the end.\"\n>\n> \"You're too literal. That's why I beat you in so many strategy games.\"\n>\n> \"Only forty-three percent of the time, young man,\" Seurat corrected.\n> He activated the exit ramp.\n>\n> \"Around half.\" Vorian headed toward the hatch, anxious to get outside\n> and breathe fresh air. \"Not bad for someone susceptible to illnesses,\n> distractions, physical weaknesses, and any number of other frailties.\n> I'm gaining ground on you, too, if you care to examine trends.\" He\n> bounded down to the sprawling field of fused plascrete.\n>\n> Loader robots scurried among larger pieces of AI equipment that moved\n> about on glider fields.

At the core of its\n> artificial body hung the protected brain jar that contained the mind\n> of an ancient human general.\n>\n> The cymek swiveled its turret sensors, as if targeting him, then\n> altered its path toward Vor, raising its front grappling arms. Heavy\n> pincers clacked.\n>\n> Vorian waved and rushed forward. \"Father!\"\n>\n> Since cymeks regularly exchanged temporary bodies in response to the\n> physical requirements of various activities, they were difficult to\n> distinguish from each other. However, Vor's father came to see him\n> whenever the *Dream Voyager* returned from its update-delivery\n> missions.\n>\n> Many enslaved humans lived on the Synchronized Worlds, serving the\n> evermind. Omnius kept them on as token workers, though few had lives\n> as important and comfortable as Vorian's. Trustees like himself\n> received special training, went through rigorous instruction at elite\n> schools for crew bosses and other important positions under the\n> machine domination.\n>\n> Vor had read about the glories of the Titans and knew the stories of\n> his father's great conquests. Raised under the evermind's wing and\n> trained by his cymek father, the young man had never questioned the\n> world order or his own loyalty to Omnius.\n>\n> Knowing the robot captain's moderate temperament, Agamemnon had used\n> considerable influence to obtain a spot for his son on Seurat's update\n> ship, an enviable assignment even among the chosen trustees. As an\n> independent\n>\n> robot, Seurat did not mind the young man's company, suggesting that\n> Vor's unpredictable personality was an asset to their missions.\n> Occasionally, Omnius himself asked Vor to participate in role-playing\n> simulations to better understand the capabilities of feral humans.\n>\n> Without fear, Vorian now raced across the landing field to stand\n> beside the weapon-studded cymek, who towered over him. The young man\n> stared fondly at the suspended brain case of his ancient father, with\n> its strange mechanical face now on the underside.\n>\n> \"Welcome back.\" Agamemnon's vocal patches made his voice deep and\n> paternal. \"Seurat has already uploaded his report. Once again, you\n> have made me proud. You are one step closer to meeting our goals.\" He\n> swiveled his turret around, reversing the direction of progress, and\n> Vorian trotted beside the armored legs as Agamemnon strode away from\n> the ship.\n>\n> \"If only my fragile body survives long enough to accomplish\n> everything,\" Vor said wistfully. \"I can't wait to be selected as a\n> neo-cymek.\"\n>\n> \"You are only twenty, Vorian. Too young to be morbidly concerned about\n> your mortality.\"\n>\n> Overhead, resource haulers dropped from orbit, balanced atop\n> yellow-white flames that slowed their descent. Loadcars manned by\n> human workers trundled up to where ships had landed, preparing to\n> distribute cargoes according to rigid instructions. Vor glanced at the\n> slaves but did not ponder their situation. Each person had his own\n> duties, every human and machine a cog in the Synchronized Worlds. But\n> Vor was superior to the others, since he had a chance to become like\n> his father one day. A cymek.\n>\n> They passed unmarked warehouses with computerized monitoring and\n> inventory systems where fuel and supplies were stored. Human clerical\n> personnel dispersed food and materials from storehouses to slaves\n> inside the city. Inspectors--- some robotic, some human--- performed\n> quality control and quantity assessments for the larger-scale plans of\n> Omnius.\n>\n> Vor could not comprehend the lives of the uneducated workers who\n> unloaded heavy crates at the space dock. The slave laborers performed\n> duties that a simple loading machine could have done faster and more\n> efficiently. But he was pleased that even these lesser people had\n> tasks they could perform in order to earn their subsistence.\n>\n> \"Seurat told me about Salusa Secundus, Father.\" He maintained a quick\n> pace to match the cymek's huge strides. \"I'm sorry your assault was\n> unsuccessful.\"\n>\n> \"Just a test case,\" Agamemnon said. \"The feral humans have a new\n> defensive system, and now we have probed it.\"\n>\n> Vor beamed. \"I'm sure you'll discover a way to bring all *hrethgir*\n> under the efficient rule of Omnius. Like the times described in your\n> memoirs, when Titans were in complete control.\"\n>\n> Inwardly, the cymek general frowned at the comments. Agamemnon's optic\n> threads detected numerous watcheyes floating around them as the two\n> walked. \"I do not wish for the old days, of course,\" he said,\n> presently. \"You have been reading my memoirs again?\"\n>\n> \"I never tire of your stories, Father. The Time of Titans, the great\n> Tlaloc, the First Hrethgir Rebellions . . . everything is so\n> fascinating.\" Accompanying the magnificent cymek made Vor feel\n> special. He always remained alert, within the limitations of his\n> position, for ways to better himself. He wanted to prove himself\n> worthy of the opportunities he'd been given . . . and of more. \"I\n> would be happy to learn of this new *hrethgir* defensive system,\n> Father. Perhaps I can assist you in finding a way to defeat it?\"\n>\n> \"Omnius is analyzing the data and will decide what to do. I have only\n> recently arrived back on Earth.\"\n>\n> With human ambitions still a fundamental part of their psyches, the\n> Titans always had monumental construction projects under way:\n> megalithic buildings and monuments to themselves that celebrated the\n> lost age of humanity and glorified the Time of Titans. Captive human\n> artists and\n>\n> architects were ordered to develop original designs and sketches that\n> the cymeks modified or approved.\n>\n> Nearby, machinery lifted the components of skyscraper buildings into\n> place, adding upper floors to existing complexes, though the thinking\n> machines had little need for further expansion. At times, the\n> extravagant construction seemed to Vor like mere busy-work for the\n> slaves. . . .\n>\n> He had never known his mother, and understood only that ages ago,\n> before the Titans had surgically converted themselves into cymeks,\n> Agamemnon had created his own sperm bank, from which he had germinated\n> Vorian. Over the centuries, the general could create any number of\n> offspring using acceptable surrogate mothers.\n>\n> Though he had never learned about any siblings, Vorian suspected they\n> were out there somewhere. He wondered what it would be like to meet\n> them, but in machine society, emotional attachments were not\n> practical. He only hoped that his siblings had not proven to be\n> disappointments to Agamemnon.\n>\n> When his father was off on his frequent missions, Vor often tried to\n> talk with the remaining Titans, curious about the events recorded in\n> Agamemnon's celebrated and voluminous memoirs. He used his responsible\n> position to better himself. Some of the original cymeks--- especially\n> Ajax--- were arrogant and treated Vor as a nuisance. Others, like Juno\n> or Barbarossa, found him amusing. All of them spoke with utmost\n> passion about Tlaloc, the first of the great Titans, who had sparked\n> the revolution.\n>\n> \"I wish I'd been able to meet Tlaloc,\" Vor said, trying to keep the\n> conversation going. Agamemnon loved to speak of his glory days.\n>\n> \"Yes, Tlaloc was a dreamer with ideas I had never heard before,\" the\n> cymek mused as he strode down the boulevards. \"At times he was a bit\n> na\u00efve, not always understanding the practical repercussions of his\n> ideas. But I pointed them out to him. That was why we made such a\n> great team.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon seemed to pick up speed when he spoke of the Titans. Weary\n> from trying to keep up the rapid pace, Vorian gasped for breath.\n>\n> \"Tlaloc took his name from an ancient rain god. Among the Titans,\n> Tlaloc was our visionary, while I was the military commander. Juno was\n> our tactician and manipulator. Dante watched over statistics,\n> bureaucracy, and population-accounting. Barbarossa saw to the\n> reprogramming of the thinking machines, making certain they had the\n> same goals as we did. He gave them ambition.\"\n>\n> \"And a good thing, too,\" Vorian said.\n>\n> Agamemnon hesitated, but did not voice any objections, wary of the\n> watcheyes. \"When he visited Earth, Tlaloc realized how the human race\n> had gone stagnant, how people had become so dependent on machines that\n> they had nothing left but apathy. Their goals were gone, their drive,\n> their passion. When they should have had nothing to do but unleash\n> their creative impulses, they were too lazy to perform even the work\n> of the imagination.\" His vocal speakers made a disgusted sound.\n>\n> \"But Tlaloc was different,\" Vor said, on cue.\n>\n> The cymek's voice took on more emotion. \"Tlaloc grew up in the Thalim\n> system, on an outer colony world where life was difficult, where labor\n> was not accomplished without sweat, blood, and blisters. He had to\n> fight his way and earn his position. On Earth, he saw that the human\n> spirit had all but died---*and the people hadn't even noticed!*\n>\n> \"He gave speeches attempting to rally the humans, to make them see\n> what was happening. A few watched him with interest, considering him a\n> novelty.\" Agamemnon raised one of his powerful metal arms. \"But they\n> heard his words only as a diversion. Soon the bored audiences returned\n> to their slothful, hedonistic pursuits.\"\n>\n> \"But not you, Father.\"\n>\n> \"I was dissatisfied with my uneventful life. I had already met Juno,\n> and the two of us had dreams. Tlaloc crystallized them for us. After\n> Juno and I joined him, we set in motion the events that led to the\n> downfall of the Old Empire.\"\n>\n> Father and son arrived at the central complex where the Earth-Omnius\n> resided, although redundant nodes of the evermind were distributed\n> around the planet in a network of armored vaults and high towers.\n> Vorian followed the cymek into the main structure, eager to do his\n> part. This was a ritual they had completed many times.\n>\n> The walker body strode through wide halls and entered a maintenance\n> facility filled with lubricant tubes, bubbling nutrient cylinders,\n> polished tabletops, and flickering analysis systems. Vor retrieved a\n> tool kit, then turned on vacuum hoses and high-pressure water jets,\n> found soft rags and polishing lotions. He considered it his most\n> important task as a trustee.\n>\n> In the center of the sterile room, Agamemnon halted beneath a lifting\n> apparatus. A magnetic claw-hand came down and attached itself to the\n> preservation canister that held his ancient brain. Neural connection\n> ports popped open, and thoughtrode cables spiraled away. The lifting\n> arm raised the canister, still attached to temporary batteries and\n> life-support systems.\n>\n> Vorian came forward with an armload of equipment. \"I know you can't\n> feel this, Father, but I like to think it makes you more comfortable\n> and efficient.\" He blasted the connection ports with high-pressure air\n> and streams of warm water, using a wadded cloth to polish every\n> surface. The cymek general transmitted wordless gratified murmurings.\n>\n> Vor completed the cleaning and polishing, then adjusted wires and\n> cables and hooked up diagnostics. \"All functions optimal, Father.\"\n>\n> \"With your attentive maintenance, it is no wonder. Thank you, my son.\n> You take such good care of me.\"\n>\n> \"It is my honor to do so.\"\n>\n> His synthesized voice purring, Agamemnon said, \"One day, Vorian, if\n> you continue serving me so well, I will recommend you for the greatest\n> reward. I will ask Omnius to surgically convert you into a cymek, like\n> me.\"\n>\n> At the mention of this wonderful prospect, Vorian again polished the\n> canister, then looked lovingly at the creamy contours of the brain\n> inside. He tried to hide his flush of eager embarrassment, but tears\n> came to his eyes. \"That is the best a human can hope for.\"\n>\n> *Humans, with such fragile physical forms, are easily crushed. Is it\n> any challenge to hurt or damage them?*\n\n--- ERASMUS,\n\nuncollated laboratory files\n\n> **G**azing out upon the skies of Earth again through hundreds of\n> appraising optic threads, Erasmus was not pleased. The robot stood in\n> a high bell tower of his villa, staring through a curving expanse of\n> armored windowplate. The landscape of this world, with its oceans and\n> forests and cities built upon the bones of other cities had already\n> seen countless civilizations rise and fall. The scope of history made\n> his own accomplishments seem small and contrived.\n>\n> Therefore, he would have to try harder.\n>\n> Neither Omnius nor any of his delegated architect robots understood\n> true beauty. To Erasmus, the buildings and the layout of the rebuilt\n> city resembled components with sharp angles, abrupt discontinuities. A\n> city must be more than an efficient circuit diagram. Under his\n> multiphased scrutiny, the metropolis looked like an elaborate\n> mechanism, designed and constructed with utilitarian force. It had its\n> own clean lines and systematic efficiency, which resulted in a\n> completely serendipitous beauty . . . but there was no finesse\n> whatsoever.\n>\n> It was such a disappointment when the omniscient evermind refused to\n> live up to his potential. Sometimes, gloriously unrealistic human\n> ambitions had a certain merit.\n>\n> Omnius either ignored or intentionally refuted the graceful beauty of\n> Golden Age human architecture. But such cold and petulant superiority\n> was not logical. Admittedly, Erasmus could see a certain beauty in\n> streamlined machines and components--- he rather liked his own\n> burnished platinum skinfilm, the smooth grace of his mirrored face\n> with which he formed facial\n>\n> expressions. But he saw no point in maintaining ugliness just to spite\n> a perceived enemy's concept of beauty.\n>\n> How could a vast computer mind distributed across hundreds of planets\n> exhibit even a hint of narrow-mindedness? To Erasmus, with his\n> detached and mature understanding developed through long\n> contemplation, Omnius's attitude revealed a lack of comprehensive\n> thinking.\n>\n> Making the sound of an exaggerated sigh that he had copied from\n> humans, he transmitted a thought-command that caused projection shades\n> to drop over the windows in the bell tower. Choosing his mood, he\n> projected artificial, pastoral views from other worlds. So soothing\n> and peaceful.\n>\n> On one wall he paused at a clothing synthesizer, selected the design\n> he wanted, and waited while a garment was prepared for him. A\n> traditional painter's smock. When it was ready, he draped it over his\n> sleek body and crossed the room to an easel where he had already set\n> up a blank canvas, a palette of paints, and fine brushes.\n>\n> At a wave of his hand, the projection shades shifted to display\n> enlarged images of masterpiece paintings, each one highlighting a\n> different great master. He selected \"Cottages at Cordeville\" by an\n> ancient Earth artist, Vincent Van Gogh. It was bold and colorful but\n> basically crude in its implementation, with inept lines and childish\n> pigment applications that featured thick globs of paint and smears of\n> color. Yet when considered as a whole, the painting itself possessed a\n> certain raw energy, an indefinable primitive vibrancy.\n>\n> After deep concentration, Erasmus thought he had a delicate\n> understanding of Van Gogh's technique. But the comprehension of *why*\n> anyone would want to create it in the first place eluded him.\n>\n> Although he had never painted before, he copied the artwork exactly.\n>\n> Brushstroke for brushstroke, pigment for pigment. When he was\n> finished,\n>\n> Erasmus examined his masterpiece. \"There, the sincerest form of\n> flattery.\"\n>\n> The nearest wall-mounted screen brightened to a pale gray wash of\n> light. Omnius had been watching, as always. Erasmus would no doubt\n> have to justify his activities, since the evermind would never\n> understand what the independent robot was doing.\n>\n> He studied the painting again. Why was it so hard to understand\n> creativity? Should he just change some of the components at random and\n> call it an original work? As the robot finished his scrutiny,\n> satisfied that he had made no mistakes, that he had not deviated from\n> the tolerances he could see in the image of the painting, Erasmus\n> waited for a rush of comprehension.\n>\n> Slowly, he came to realize that what he had just completed was not\n> really *art*, any more than a printing press created literature. He\n> had only *copied* the ancient composition in every detail. He had\n> added nothing, synthesized no newness. And he burned with the need to\n> understand the difference.\n>\n> Frustrated, Erasmus took a different tack. In an implacable voice, he\n> summoned three servants and ordered them to carry his painting\n> supplies out to one of the laboratory buildings. \"I intend to create a\n> new work of art, all my own. A still life, of sorts. You three will be\n> vital parts of the process. Rejoice in your good fortune.\"\n>\n> In the sterile environment of the laboratory, with the cold assistance\n> of his personal robot guards, Erasmus proceeded to vivisect the trio\n> of victims, oblivious to their screams. \"I want to get to the heart of\n> the matter,\" he quipped, \"the lifeblood of it.\"\n>\n> With stained metal hands he studied the dripping organs, squeezed\n> them, watched their juices flow and cellular structures collapse. He\n> performed a cursory analysis, discovering sloppy mechanics and\n> inefficient circulatory systems that were unnecessarily complex and\n> prone to failure.\n>\n> Then, feeling a vibrant energy, an *impulsiveness*, Erasmus set up a\n> tableau to paint. A new work, completely unique! It would be his own\n> arrangement, and he would tint the images using different filters,\n> making a few intentional mistakes to better approximate human\n> imperfection and uncertainty.\n>\n> At last, he must be on the right track.\n>\n> At his command, the sentinel robots brought in a vat filled with\n> fresh, uncoagulated human blood. Erasmus began removing the\n> interesting array of human organs--- still warm to the touch--- from\n> his table, and instructed two cleaning drones to scrape out the\n> insides from the donor bodies. Contemplating the arrangement and\n> order, he dropped organ after organ into the blood and watched them\n> bob in the liquid--- eyes, livers, kidneys, hearts.\n>\n> Slowly assessing each step of the process, he set up exactly what his\n> \"creative urges\" told him to do. Whim upon whim. Erasmus added more\n> ingredients to the grisly stew. Pursuant to something he had learned\n> about the artist Van Gogh, he sliced an ear off one of the corpses and\n> tossed it into the vat as well.\n>\n> Finally, his metal hands dripping gore, he stepped back. A beautiful\n> arrangement--- one that was totally original to him. He could think of\n> no famous human artist who had worked on such a canvas. No one else\n> had ever done anything approaching this.\n>\n> Erasmus wiped his smooth metallic hands and began to paint upon a\n> virgin canvas. On the blank medium, he astutely drew one of the three\n> hearts, showing in perfect detail the ventricals, auricles, and aorta.\n> But this was not meant to be a realistic dissection image.\n> Dissatisfied, he smeared some of the lines to add an artistic flair.\n> True art required the right amount of uncertainty, just as gourmet\n> cooking needed the proper spices and flavors.\n>\n> This must be how creativity worked. As he painted, Erasmus tried to\n> imagine the kinesthetic relationship between his brain and his\n> mechanical fingers, the thought impulses that set the fingers into\n> motion.\n>\n> \"Is *that* what the humans define as art?\" Omnius said from a\n> wallscreen.\n>\n> For once, Erasmus did not debate with the evermind. Omnius was correct\n> in his skepticism. Erasmus had not attained true creativity. Yes, he\n> had produced an original and graphic arrangement. But in human\n> artwork, the\n>\n> sum of the components added up to more than the individual items. Just\n> ripping organs from victims, floating them in blood, and painting them\n> brought him no closer to understanding human inspiration. Even if he\n> manipulated the details, he remained imprecise and uninspired.\n>\n> Still, this might be a step in the right direction.\n>\n> Erasmus could not carry this thought to the next logical step, and he\n> came to understand why. The process was not ratiocinative at all.\n> Creativity and the precision of analysis were mutually exclusive.\n>\n> Frustrated, the robot gripped the macabre painting in his powerful\n> hands, broke the frame, and tore the canvas to shreds. He would have\n> to do better than this, much better. Erasmus shifted his metallic\n> polymer face to a stylized pensive mask. He was no closer to\n> comprehending humans, despite a century of intensive research and\n> musings.\n>\n> Walking slowly, Erasmus went to his private sanctuary, a botanical\n> garden where he listened to classical music piped through the cellular\n> structures of plants. \"Rhapsody in Blue,\" by a composer of Old Earth.\n>\n> In the contemplative garden, the troubled robot sat in the ruddy\n> sunlight and felt warmth on his metal skin. This was another thing\n> that humans seemed to enjoy, but he did not understand why. Even with\n> his sensory enhancement module, it just seemed like *heat*.\n>\n> And machines that overheated broke down.\n>\n> *The tapestry of the universe is vast and complex, with infinite\n> patterns. While threads of tragedy may form the primary weave,\n> humanity with its undaunted optimism still manages to embroider small\n> designs of happiness and love.*\n>\n> --- COGITOR KWYNA,\n\nCity of Introspection archives\n\n> **A**fter his long sojourn in space, Xavier could think only of being\n> home, and back in the warm embrace of Serena Butler.\n>\n> On furlough, he returned to the Tantor estate where he was welcomed by\n> his adoptive parents and their enthusiastic son Vergyl. The Tantors\n> were a soft-spoken older couple, gentle and intelligent, with dark\n> skin and hair the color of thick smoke. Xavier seemed to be cut from\n> the same mold, with similar interests and high moral values. He had\n> grown up in this warm and spacious manor house, which he still\n> considered home. Though he had legally inherited other Harkonnen\n> holdings--- mining and industrial operations on three planets--- many\n> rooms in the Tantor mansion were still set aside for his use.\n>\n> As he entered his familiar large suite, Xavier found a pair of shaggy\n> gray wolfhounds awaiting him, wagging their tails. He dropped his bags\n> and wrestled with the dogs. The animals, larger than his little\n> brother, were always playful and delighted to see him.\n>\n> That evening, the family feasted on the cook's specialty of sage fowl\n> roasted with honey, slivered nuts, and olives from the Tantors' own\n> groves. Unfortunately, after his exposure to the cymeks' searing gas,\n> the subtle nuances of flavors and aromas now eluded him. The cook gave\n> him an alarmed look when he dumped salt and seasoning--- which he\n> needed to taste anything at all--- onto the delicate food.\n>\n> Another thing the thinking machines had taken from him.\n>\n> Afterward, Xavier lounged in a heavy oak chair before a roaring fire,\n> sipping a red wine from the Tantor family vineyards--- also,\n> unfortunately, nearly tasteless. He luxuriated in relaxing at home,\n> away from military protocol. He had spent almost half a year aboard\n> the efficient but bare-bones Armada survey ships; tonight he would\n> sleep like a babe in his own bedchamber.\n>\n> One of the gray wolfhounds snored loudly, resting a furry muzzle on\n> Xavier's stockinged feet. Emil Tantor, with a fringe of smoky hair\n> around his bald crown, sat in the chair opposite his adopted son. Emil\n> asked about the strategic positions of the Synchronized Worlds and the\n> military capabilities of the Armada. \"What are the chances of the war\n> escalating after the attack on Zimia? Can we ever do more than drive\n> them back?\"\n>\n> Xavier finished his wine, poured another half glass for himself and a\n> full one for the older man, then sat back in the chair again, all\n> without disturbing the gray dog. \"The situation looks grim, Father.\"\n> Barely remembering his own parents, he had always called the Tantor\n> lord his father. \"But, then, it has always looked grim, ever since the\n> Time of Titans. Perhaps we lived too comfortably in the days of the\n> Old Empire. We forgot how to be ourselves, how to live up to our\n> potential, and for a thousand years afterward we've paid the price. We\n> were easy prey--- first for evil men, then for soulless machines.\"\n>\n> Emil Tantor sipped his wine, and stared into the fireplace. \"So is\n> there hope, at least? We must have something to cling to.\"\n>\n> Xavier's lips formed a gentle smile. \"We are human, Father. As long as\n> we hold onto that, there is always hope.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THE NEXT DAY Xavier sent a message to the Butler estate, asking\n> permission to accompany the Viceroy's daughter on the annual\n> bristleback hunt, scheduled in two days. Serena would already know\n> that Xavier had returned. His survey ships had arrived with much\n> fanfare, and Manion Butler would have been expecting his note.\n>\n> Still, Salusan society was formal and extravagant. In order to court\n> the beautiful daughter of the Viceroy, one had to bow to certain\n> expectations.\n>\n> In late morning a messenger pounded on the doors of the Tantor manor\n> house; Vergyl stood beside his big brother, grinning when he saw the\n> expression on Xavier's face. \"What is it? Can I come along? Did the\n> Viceroy say yes?\"\n>\n> Xavier made a mock-stern expression. \"How could he possibly turn down\n> the man who saved Salusa Secundus from the cymeks? Remember that,\n> Vergyl, if you ever wish to win the affections of a young lady.\"\n>\n> \"I need to save a *planet* just to have a girlfriend?\" The boy sounded\n> skeptical, though wary of outright disbelief when it came to Xavier's\n> words.\n>\n> \"For a woman as magnificent as Serena, that is exactly what you must\n> do.\" He strode into the great house to tell the Tantors his plans.\n>\n> The next dawn, Xavier dressed in his finest equestrian outfit and rode\n> into brightening daylight toward the Butler property. He borrowed his\n> father's chocolate-brown Salusan stallion, a fine beast with a braided\n> mane, narrow muzzle, and bright eyes. The animal's ears were large,\n> and its gait flowed without the jarring rhythm of less conditioned\n> horses. On the crest of a grassy hill stood a cluster of ornate\n> whitewashed buildings--- a main house, stables, servants' quarters,\n> and storage sheds arranged as outbuildings along the perimeter of a\n> split-rail fence. As his horse climbed, he saw impressive vistas of\n> the white spires of Zimia far behind him.\n>\n> A path paved with crushed limestone wound up to the crest. The gravel\n> crunched under the stallion's hooves as Xavier rode, breathing the\n> crisp air. He could feel the moist chill of early spring, saw fresh\n> leaves on the trees, a dazzle of wildflowers in their first bloom. But\n> each breath he drew into his new lungs smelled flat.\n>\n> Grapevines lined the hill like green corduroy, carefully tended and\n> watered, each vine tied to cables between stakes so that the clusters\n> would hang off the ground for easy picking. Twisted olive trees\n> surrounded the main house,\n>\n> their low branches awash with white flowers. Each year, the first\n> pressings of grapes and olives were cause for feasting in every\n> Salusan household; local vineyards vied against each other to see\n> which could produce the best vintages.\n>\n> As Xavier rode through the gates and into the courtyard, other\n> horsemen in hunting outfits milled about. Barking dogs dodged around\n> the stallion's legs, but the chocolate-brown horse stood majestically,\n> ignoring the hounds as if they were ill-mannered little boys.\n>\n> Contract huntsmen grabbed the leashes and pulled the dogs back into\n> order. A number of short black hunting horses pranced about, as\n> impatient as the dogs. Two of the huntsmen whistled loudly and others\n> joined them, ready to begin the day's festivities.\n>\n> Manion Butler strolled out of the stables, calling up his team like a\n> military commander positioning troops for battle. He glanced at the\n> young officer, raised a hand in greeting.\n>\n> Then Xavier saw Serena riding out on a gray mare with beautiful lines\n> and an ornate saddle. She wore high boots, jodhpurs, and a black\n> riding jacket. Her eyes were like electric sparks as her gaze met his.\n>\n> She cantered over to where Xavier sat astride his mount, a smile\n> forming at the edges of her mouth. Even with all the barking dogs,\n> restless horses, and shouting huntsmen, Xavier wanted to kiss her so\n> badly that he could barely restrain himself. Yet Serena remained\n> coolly formal, extending a gloved hand in greeting. He took it,\n> holding her fingertips.\n>\n> How he wished he could be telepathic like the Sorceresses of Rossak,\n> just to send her his thoughts. But from the obvious delight suffusing\n> her face, he thought Serena understood his feelings well enough, and\n> reciprocated them.\n>\n> \"The journeys across space were so long,\" he said. \"And I thought\n> about you all the time.\"\n>\n> \"*All* the time? You should have been concentrating on your duties.\"\n> She gave him a skeptical smile. \"Perhaps we can find time alone during\n> today's hunt, and you will tell me what you dreamed of.\"\n>\n> Playfully, she urged her gray mare to trot over to where her father\n> waited. Conscious of the eyes watching them, she and Xavier maintained\n> an acceptable distance. He rode forward and clasped her father's\n> black-gloved hand. \"I thank you for allowing me to participate in the\n> hunt, Viceroy.\"\n>\n> Manion Butler's florid face rearranged itself into a grin. \"I'm glad\n> you could join us, Tercero Harkonnen. This year I'm certain we'll\n> track down a bristleback. The beasts are definitely in these woods---\n> and I, for one, have been craving hams and roasts. And bristlebacon,\n> especially. There's nothing like it.\"\n>\n> Her eyes dancing, Serena looked at him. \"Perhaps, Father, if you\n> brought along fewer barking dogs, galloping horses, and men crashing\n> through the underbrush, some of those shy animals would be easier to\n> find.\"\n>\n> In response, Manion smiled as if she were still a precocious little\n> girl. Glancing at Xavier, he said, \"I'm glad you'll be there to\n> protect her, young man.\"\n>\n> The Viceroy raised his right arm. Horns sounded and a brass gong\n> clanged from the stables. The purebred hounds began to bay, clustering\n> toward the far fence. Ahead, the path led beyond the blossoming olive\n> groves and into the scrubby Salusan forest. Two eager-eyed boys swung\n> open the gates, already anticipating their first bristleback hunt.\n>\n> The party rode out like a rowdy gang, dogs pushing first through the\n> gates, followed by the big horses that carried the professional\n> huntsmen. Manion Butler rode with them, blowing an antique bugle that\n> had been with his family since Bovko Manresa's first settlement on\n> Salusa.\n>\n> The followers rode lesser mounts, hurrying behind the horses. These\n> helper crews would set up camp and dress and skin whatever wild game\n> the\n>\n> huntsmen caught. They would also prepare the feast once the party\n> returned to the main house.\n>\n> The hunters had already spread out, with each chief taking a point and\n> plunging into the outskirts of the forest. Unhurried, Xavier and\n> Serena trotted toward the dark green woods. One bright-eyed young man,\n> trailing behind, glanced over his shoulder and winked at Xavier, as if\n> he knew that the young couple had no intention of enjoying the hunt\n> for its own sake.\n>\n> Xavier urged his stallion forward. Serena rode beside him, and they\n> chose their own path through thinning trees to a muddy streambed wet\n> with spring flow. Smiling secretively at each other, they listened to\n> the distant sounds of dogs and her father's continuing bugle blasts.\n>\n> The Butler's private forest covered hundreds of acres, crisscrossed by\n> game trails. Mostly it was left as a preserve, with meadows and\n> sparkling creeks, nesting birds, and lush patches of flowers that\n> bloomed in successive splashes of color as the patches of crusty snow\n> faded.\n>\n> Xavier was simply happy to be alone with Serena. Riding side by side,\n> they brushed arms and shoulders, intentionally. He would reach up to\n> hold green branches away from her face, and Serena pointed out birds\n> and small animals, identifying them.\n>\n> In his comfortable hunting outfit, Xavier carried a sheathed\n> ceremonial dagger, a bullwhip, and a Chandler pistol that shot\n> jacketed crystal fragments. Serena carried her own knife and a small\n> pistol. But neither of them expected to bring down any prey. To them,\n> their hunt was for each other, and both knew it.\n>\n> Serena chose her path without hesitation, as if she had spent time\n> during Xavier's survey mission riding through the forest in search of\n> places where they could be alone. Finally, she led him through a stand\n> of dark pines to a meadow with tall grasses, starlike flowers, and\n> thick reeds taller than her head. The reeds surrounded a mirror-smooth\n> pond, a shallow old tarn created by winter snow melt and refreshed by\n> an underground spring.\n>\n> \"The water has bubbles in it,\" she said. \"It tingles your skin.\"\n>\n> \"Does that mean you want to go for a swim?\" Xavier's throat tightened\n> at the prospect.\n>\n> \"It'll be cold, but the spring has some natural heat. I'm willing to\n> risk it.\" With a smile, Serena dismounted and let her mare graze. She\n> heard a splash out in the pond, but the reeds blocked their view.\n>\n> \"Sounds like a lot of fish, too,\" Xavier said. He slid down from his\n> stallion, patted the muscular neck, and let his mount sniff at the\n> thick grasses and flowers near the gray mare.\n>\n> Serena pulled off her riding boots and stockings, then lifted her\n> loose jodhpurs above her knees as she walked barefoot into the rushes.\n> \"I'm going to test the water.\" She pushed the hollow grasses aside.\n>\n> Xavier checked the fastenings on his stallion's saddle. He worked open\n> one of the leather compartments and brought out a bottle of fresh\n> citrus water to share. He followed Serena toward the reeds, already\n> imagining how it would be to swim beside her, just the two of them\n> stroking naked through this lonely forest lake, kissing each other. .\n> . .\n>\n> Without warning, a monstrous bristleback charged out of the reeds,\n> spraying mud and water from its cool wallowing hole. Serena let out a\n> cry, more of alarm than terror, and fell backward into the mud.\n>\n> The bristleback pawed at the rushes with its cloven hooves. Long tusks\n> protruded from a squarish snout, each a bony maul for uprooting\n> saplings and eviscerating enemies. The animal had wide-set eyes, large\n> and black. It made loud grunts as if preparing to breathe fire. In\n> tales of great bristleback hunts, many men, hunting dogs, and horses\n> had died--- but there were so few of the animals anymore.\n>\n> \"Into the water, Serena!\"\n>\n> The bristleback turned as it heard his shout. Serena did exactly as\n> Xavier said, splashing away from the rushes, deeper into the pond. She\n> began to swim, knowing the boar could not charge her if she was in\n> deep enough water.\n>\n> The bristleback stomped out of the rushes. The two horses squealed and\n> skittered back toward the edge of the meadow.\n>\n> \"Look out, Xavier!\" Waist deep now, Serena drew her hunting knife, but\n> knew she couldn't help him.\n>\n> Xavier planted his legs firmly, held a knife in one hand and the\n> Chandler pistol in the other. Without flinching, he aimed the\n> crystal-shard weapon and shot the bristleback three times in the face.\n> The sharp projectiles tore through the animal's cheek and forehead,\n> gouging the thick skull. Another shot splintered one of the tusks. But\n> the bristleback kept charging toward him, caught up in its own\n> solitary stampede.\n>\n> Xavier fired twice more. The mangled creature bled profusely, mortally\n> wounded--- but even imminent death did not diminish its momentum. As\n> the beast thundered toward him, Xavier jumped to one side and slashed\n> the sharp knife across its throat, opening jugular and carotid\n> vessels. The bristleback turned, gushing blood upon him even as its\n> heart began to fade.\n>\n> The weight of the falling creature knocked Xavier to the ground, but\n> he wrestled it away, avoiding the convulsive thrusts of the razor\n> tusks. The killing done, Xavier climbed back to his feet and staggered\n> away, shivering in shock. His hunting outfit was soaked with the\n> beast's blood.\n>\n> He sprinted into the trampled rushes at the edge of the water.\n> \"Serena!\" \"I'm all right,\" she called, splashing toward the shore.\n>\n> He looked at his reflection in the placid pond, saw his shirt and face\n> covered with gore. He hoped none of it was his own. He cupped his\n> hands and splashed cool water on his skin, then dunked his head to\n> wash the stink from his hair. He scrubbed his hands with peaty sand.\n>\n> Serena came to him, her clothes drenched, wet hair clinging to her\n> skull. She used a corner of her riding jacket to dab the blood from\n> his neck and cheeks. Then she opened his shirt, wiping his chest as\n> well.\n>\n> \"I don't have a scratch on me,\" he said, not sure if it was true. The\n> skin on one side of his neck felt raw and hot, as if chafed, and his\n> chest was sore from the collision with the attacker. He clutched her\n> arm, pulling her closer. \"Are you sure you're not hurt? You aren't\n> cut, no bones broken?\"\n>\n> \"You're asking me?\" she said with teasing disbelief. \"*I'm* not the\n> brave boar fighter here.\"\n>\n> Serena kissed him. Her lips were cold from the water, but he held them\n> against his own, awakening her touch with his until their mouths\n> opened slightly, their breath warm inside each other as the kiss\n> deepened. He took her from the edge of the pond, through the rushes,\n> and to the soft meadow grass, far from the dead bristleback.\n>\n> The young lovers stroked the wet hair away from their ears and eyes,\n> and kissed again. The brush with death made them feel intensely alive.\n> Xavier's skin was hot, and his heart kept pounding, even though the\n> danger was past. A new excitement mounted. He wished he could better\n> enjoy the seductive scent of her perfume, but could detect only a\n> tantalizing thread.\n>\n> Serena's sodden clothes were cold, and Xavier noticed goosebumps on\n> her pale arms. All he could think to do was to remove the wet fabric.\n> \"Here, let me warm you.\"\n>\n> She helped him unfasten the black riding jacket and her blouse while\n> her own fingers worked at his bloodstained shirt. \"Just to make\n> certain you're not hurt,\" Serena said. \"I don't know what I would have\n> done if you'd been killed.\" Her words came fast and hard between\n> kisses.\n>\n> \"It takes more than a wild boar to keep me away from you.\"\n>\n> She yanked his shirt down over his shoulders and fumbled with his cuff\n> so she could take it off entirely. The meadow was soft and lush. The\n> horses\n>\n> munched patiently on grasses as Xavier and Serena made love without\n> restraint, expressing their pent-up passions, whispering and then\n> shouting their love for each other.\n>\n> The rest of the hunting party seemed far away, even though Xavier had\n> killed a bristleback and would have a dramatic story to tell during\n> the evening's feast. Of course, certain details would need to be\n> omitted. . . .\n>\n> For the moment, the war with the thinking machines did not exist. In\n> this brief and heady hour, they were just two human beings, alone and\n> in love.\n>\n> *There is a certain hubris to science, a belief that the more we\n> develop technology and the more we learn, the better our lives will\n> be.*\n>\n> --- TLALOC,\n\n*A Time for Titans*\n\n> **A**nything imagined can be made real . . . given sufficient genius.\n>\n> Tio Holtzman had said as much in a hundred speeches at the Lords\n> Council on Poritrin. His concepts and achievements sparked dreams and\n> fostered confidence in human technological capabilities against the\n> thinking machines.\n>\n> The mantra had also been picked up by his patron, Lord Niko Bludd, and\n> by representatives in the League of Nobles. Early in his career,\n> Holtzman had realized that it was not always the best scientists who\n> received the accolades or funding. Instead, it was the best *showmen*,\n> the most effective politicians.\n>\n> To be sure, Savant Holtzman was an adequate scientist. He had an\n> exceptional technical background and had achieved marked success with\n> his inventions and weapons systems, all of which had been put to good\n> use against Omnius. But he had arranged for more publicity and\n> attention than the inventions themselves warranted. Through his\n> oratory skills and by coloring certain details, he had constructed a\n> pedestal of fame on which he now stood. Holtzman had made himself into\n> the Hero of Poritrin, rather than just another nameless inventor. His\n> ability to enchant audiences, to spark a sense of wonder and\n> possibility in their minds, exceeded his scientific skills.\n>\n> To maintain his mythology, Holtzman constantly hungered for new\n> *ideas*--- which required inspiration and long periods of\n> uninterrupted thought. He liked to let possibilities roll like pebbles\n> down a steep mountain slope. Sometimes the pebbles would come to rest,\n> making a bit of noise but\n>\n> ultimately yielding nothing; on other occasions, such notions might\n> spark an avalanche.\n>\n> *Anything imagined can be made real*.\n>\n> But first it must be imagined, seen in the vision of the creator.\n>\n> After returning home from the devastation on Salusa Secundus, he had\n> booked himself a private cabin aboard a luxurious driftbarge, one of\n> the quiet zeppelin craft that rose from the delta city of Starda and\n> drifted inland on currents of warm air, cruising across the seemingly\n> endless Poritrin plains.\n>\n> Holtzman stood on the driftbarge's open deck, looking at the\n> grasslands that flowed in a sea of green and brown, dappled with\n> lakes. Below him, birds flew like schools of fish. The slow aircraft\n> floated with no hurry, no schedule.\n>\n> He stared toward the open horizon. Limitless distances, endless\n> possibilities. Hypnotic, meditative . . . inspirational. Such places\n> opened his mind, allowed him to pursue crazy concepts and run them\n> down like a predator pursuing prey.\n>\n> The driftbarge passed over geometric shapes like tattoos on the\n> ground, carefully sectioned acreage for the labor-intensive farming of\n> sweet cane. Other fields grew plump grains and fibrous threads to make\n> Poritrin cloth. Armies of human slaves worked the farms and ranches\n> like insects from a hive.\n>\n> Following a bucolic derivative of Navachristianity, the people of\n> Poritrin had outlawed computerized harvesting apparatus and restored\n> their society to humbler roots. Without sophisticated machinery, they\n> required a great deal of manual labor. Long ago, Sajak Bludd had been\n> the first League nobleman to introduce actual slavery as a means of\n> making large-scale agriculture viable.\n>\n> That Poritrin lord had justified his act by choosing only those who\n> owed a debt to humanity, mostly Buddislamic cowards who had fled\n> instead of fighting against the repressive Titans and thinking\n> machines. If they hadn't been afraid to help defend humanity, Sajak\n> Bludd said, their added numbers might have been enough to turn the\n> tide of war. Working the fields was a small enough price for their\n> descendants to pay. . . .\n>\n> Holtzman paced the driftbarge's deck, acquired a fluted glass of\n> sugary juice from a server, and sipped it as he pondered. Looking down\n> at the sea of grasses, he relished his mental sojourn. No distractions\n> . . . but as yet no inspiration, either. The great scientist often\n> embarked on such journeys to pull his thoughts together, simply\n> staring and thinking--- and *working*, though everyone else aboard\n> seemed to be taking a holiday.\n>\n> Because of Holtzman's previous successes, Niko Bludd gave him free\n> reign to develop whatever innovative defenses and weapons struck his\n> fancy. Unfortunately, during the past year the scientist had faced a\n> growing conviction that he was running out of ideas.\n>\n> Genius was nothing without creative impulse. Of course, the Savant\n> could coast for a while on his earlier triumphs. Still, he had to\n> offer up new inventions regularly, or even Lord Bludd would begin to\n> doubt him.\n>\n> Holtzman could never permit that. It was a matter of pride.\n>\n> He'd been embarrassed that the cymeks so easily penetrated his\n> scrambler shields on Salusa Secundus. How could he--- and all the\n> other engineers and technicians on the project--- have ignored the\n> fact that cymeks had human minds, not AI gelcircuitry? It was a\n> significant, devastating lapse.\n\nStill, the outpouring of faith and hope--- not to mention substantial\nfunding\n\n> --- made him feel a crippling pressure. The people would never allow\n> him to retire now. He must find some other solution, save the day once\n> more.\n>\n> While back in the blufftop laboratories at his Starda residence, he\n> searched constantly, reading dissertations and theoretical papers\n> transmitted to him, combing them for exploitable possibilities. Many\n> of the reports were\n>\n> esoteric, beyond even his comprehension, but occasionally an idea\n> struck his fancy.\n>\n> Holtzman had brought along numerous recordings for this mental sojourn\n> over the Poritrin plains. One ambitious and intriguing paper had been\n> written by an unknown theorist from Rossak named Norma Cenva. She had\n> no credentials, as far as he could determine, but her concepts were\n> nothing short of amazing. She thought of simple things in a completely\n> different light. He had a gut feeling about her, an instinct. And she\n> had such a low profile. . . .\n>\n> As starlight fell over the vast bowl of Poritrin sky, he sat alone in\n> his cabin drinking a warm fruity beverage. He stared at Norma's\n> calculations, working them repeatedly in his mind, watchful for errors\n> while trying to understand. This young, unknown mathematician seemed\n> to harbor no pretensions, as if she simply pulled new ideas out of the\n> clouds and wanted to share them with a man she considered her\n> intellectual comrade. Stymied by some of her derivations, he realized\n> that his doubts were more about his own lack of ability than about her\n> postulations. Norma Cenva seemed divinely inspired.\n>\n> Exactly what he needed.\n>\n> Restless, Holtzman thought long and hard into the night. Finally, with\n> the arrival of dawn, he relaxed and drifted off to sleep, his decision\n> made. The airborne barge rocked in gentle breezes and continued to\n> float across the flat landscape. He dozed off with a smile on his\n> face.\n>\n> Soon he would meet Norma for himself. Perhaps some of her concepts\n> might be applicable to devices he wanted to employ against the\n> thinking machines.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THAT AFTERNOON THE Savant wrote a personal invitation to Norma Cenva\n> and dispatched it to Rossak by League courier. This young woman\n>\n> who had grown up isolated in the jungles just might prove to be his\n> salvation . . . if he handled the situation properly.\n>\n> *Opportunities are a tricky crop, with tiny flowers that are difficult\n> to see and even more difficult to harvest.*\n>\n> --- ANONYMOUS\n>\n> **F**eeling like an intruder, Norma Cenva stood in her mother's study,\n> overlooking the canopied purple trees. A sour, misty rain fell\n> outside; some of the droplets from the high skies contained impurities\n> and poisonous chemicals from spewing volcanic fumes in the distance.\n> On the far horizon, she monitored dark clouds as they drew closer.\n> Soon there would be a downpour.\n>\n> What did Aurelius Venport want her to find in here?\n>\n> Her stern mother maintained an austere room with chalky-white interior\n> walls. An alcove contained the Sorceress's fine clothes, articles that\n> were much too large and fanciful for Norma to wear. Zufa Cenva had an\n> intimidating beauty, a luminous purity that made her as perfect--- and\n> as hard--- as a classic sculpture. Even without telepathic powers, she\n> could draw men like ants to honey.\n>\n> But the chief Sorceress had only a superficial loveliness, concealing\n> an implacability about subjects she never permitted Norma to see. It\n> wasn't that Zufa didn't trust her daughter; she simply considered the\n> girl beneath grand concerns. Like her telepathic companions, Zufa\n> seemed to thrive on secrecy.\n>\n> But Aurelius had seen something here. \"You won't be sorry if you find\n> it, Norma,\" he had told her, smiling. \"I trust your mother to tell you\n> about it eventually . . . but I don't believe it is high in her\n> priorities.\"\n>\n> *I have never been high in her priorities.* Curious, but wary of being\n> caught, Norma continued to investigate.\n>\n> Her gaze settled on a fibersheet notebook resting on a worktable. The\n> thick book had a maroon cover with indecipherable lettering as arcane\n> as the\n>\n> mathematical notations Norma had developed. Once, eavesdropping on the\n> Sorceresses and their intricate plans, Norma heard them refer to their\n> private language as \"Azhar.\"\n>\n> Since returning from Salusa Secundus, her mother had been even more\n> detached and aloof than usual. She seemed driven to attempt greater\n> things, because of the cymek attack. When Norma inquired about the war\n> effort, Zufa had merely frowned at her. \"We will take care of it.\"\n>\n> The chief Sorceress spent much of her time sequestered with a\n> cabalistic clique of women, whispering secret things. Zufa had a fresh\n> passion, a new idea to use against the thinking machines. If her\n> mother had dreamed of any way Norma could contribute, she would have\n> pressed the dwarf girl into service. Instead, Zufa had entirely\n> written off her daughter without giving her a chance.\n>\n> The most talented women, numbering around three hundred, had\n> established a security zone in the deep fungoid jungle, cutting off\n> the pharmaceutical scavengers hired by Aurelius Venport. Any explorer\n> who ventured into the secluded area encountered strange shimmering\n> barricades.\n>\n> Ever alert, Norma had noticed unexplained explosions and fires out\n> where Zufa's hand-picked Sorceresses spent weeks of intensive\n> training. Her mother rarely came back to her cliffside chambers. . . .\n>\n> Now, in her mother's room, Norma discovered two pieces of fine white\n> paper beneath the maroon notebook: the bleached parchment often used\n> by League couriers. This must be what Aurelius had wanted her to find.\n>\n> Dragging a stepstool to the table, she climbed up. She could see the\n> heading on the top sheet of parchment--- a formal document from\n> Poritrin. Curious, afraid her mother might return from the jungles,\n> she removed the pages and was astonished to read in black chancery\n> lettering, SAVANT TIO HOLTZMAN.\n>\n> For what possible purpose had the great inventor written a letter to\n> her mother? Leaning down, the girl read the salutation line: \"Dear\n> Norma\n>\n> Cenva.\" With a scowl, she scanned the message, then reread it with\n> mounting delight mixed with anger. *Tio Holtzman wants me to\n> apprentice with him on Poritrin! He thinks I am brilliant? I can't\n> believe it*.\n>\n> Her own mother had attempted to conceal, or at least delay, the\n> transmittal! Zufa had said nothing, possibly unable to believe the\n> Savant would want anything to do with her daughter. Luckily, Aurelius\n> had told her about it.\n>\n> Norma hurried off to the business district of the cliffside\n> settlement. She found Venport in a tea shop, concluding a meeting with\n> a seedy-looking trader. As the dark-skinned man rose from his seat,\n> Norma hurried over with her off-kilter gait and slid into his place at\n> the table.\n>\n> Venport smiled warmly at her. \"You look excited, Norma. You must have\n> found the letter from Savant Holtzman?\"\n>\n> She thrust the parchment forward. \"My mother tried to prevent me from\n> seeing his offer!\"\n>\n> \"Zufa is a maddening woman, I know, but you must try to understand\n> her. Since neither of us can do the things she values most, Zufa\n> disregards our abilities. Oh, she's aware of your mathematical\n> talents, Norma, and she knows I'm a competent businessman, but our\n> skills do not count for anything with her.\"\n>\n> Norma squirmed on the seat, not wanting to give her mother the benefit\n> of the doubt. \"Then why did she hide this letter?\"\n>\n> Venport laughed. \"She was probably embarrassed by the attention you\n> received.\" He squeezed her hand. \"Don't worry, I will intervene if\n> your mother attempts to block this. In fact, since she's so\n> preoccupied with the other Sorceresses, I can't see how she would\n> object if I were to complete the necessary paperwork for you.\"\n>\n> \"You would do that? Doesn't my mother---\"\n>\n> \"Let me take care of everything. I'll handle her.\" He gave Norma a\n> quick, warm hug. \"I believe in what you can do.\"\n>\n> Acting in Zufa's stead, Aurelius Venport dispatched a formal letter of\n> response to the famous inventor, agreeing to send Norma away. The\n> young woman would study with him on Poritrin and assist him in his\n> laboratories. For Norma, it was the opportunity of a lifetime.\n>\n> Her mother might not even notice she was gone.\n>\n> *Home can be anywhere, for it is a part of one's self.*\n>\n> --- Zensunni saying\n>\n> **E**ven in the wasteland, with wind whipping around him, Selim's luck\n> continued to hold. Survival itself became a wondrous game out in the\n> desert.\n>\n> Leaving the dead sandworm behind, he'd tried to find a small cave or\n> gully in the rocks where he could crouch from the approaching storm.\n> Desperately thirsty, Selim poked around for any signs of human\n> habitation, though he doubted any other man had ever set foot so far\n> out in the arid wilderness.\n>\n> Certainly no one who had lived.\n>\n> After wandering from planet to planet, the Zensunni had come to\n> Arrakis, where they scattered in widely separated settlements. For\n> several generations, the scavenger people had scraped a meager\n> existence from the desert, but only occasionally did they venture from\n> their protected areas, fearful of giant worms.\n>\n> The wild sandworm had taken Selim far from the spaceport, far from the\n> vital supplies that even the most resourceful Zensunni would require.\n> His prospects for survival seemed bleak indeed.\n>\n> So when he stumbled upon an ancient botanical testing station\n> camouflaged in the rocks, Selim could hardly believe his good fortune.\n> Undoubtedly, it was another sign from Buddallah. A miracle!\n>\n> He stood before the domed enclosure erected by long-forgotten\n> ecologists who had studied Arrakis and found it wanting. Perhaps a few\n> Old Empire scientists had lived here and recorded data during a storm\n> season. The rugged structure consisted of several low outbuildings\n> built into the rocks, half-disguised by time and windblown sand.\n>\n> As the howling tempest peppered him with stinging sand, Selim\n> scrambled around the abandoned station. He saw tilted weather vanes,\n> dented wind collectors and other data-gathering devices that looked\n> long dead. Most important, he found an entry hatch.\n>\n> With sore hands and aching arms from his worm-riding ordeal, Selim\n> pounded against the barrier, searching for a way inside. He scooped\n> powdery debris away, looking for some sort of manual mechanism, since\n> batteries would have long since died. He needed to get into the\n> shelter before the storm wind slammed into him with full intensity.\n>\n> Selim had heard of such places. A few had been found and raided by\n> Zensunni scavengers. These self-reliant stations had been placed on\n> Arrakis during humanity's glory days, before the thinking machines had\n> taken over, before Buddislamic refugees had fled to safety. This\n> automated facility was at least a thousand years old, probably more.\n> But in the desert, where the environment remained unchanged for\n> millennia, time ran at a different pace.\n>\n> Selim finally located the mechanism that controlled the hatch. As he\n> had feared, the power cells were dead, providing only enough of a\n> spark to make the door groan open the barest crack.\n>\n> The wind howled. Blown sand hung like fog on the horizon, obscuring\n> the sun. Dust tingled against his raw ears and face, and Selim knew it\n> would soon become a deadly scouring.\n>\n> Growing more desperate, he wedged his sandworm tooth into the dark\n> opening and used it as a pry bar. The aperture widened a little, but\n> not enough. Cold, stale air gasped out. He used the aching muscles in\n> his arms, dug his feet against the rocks to throw his body weight into\n> the effort, and pushed hard on the makeshift lever.\n>\n> With a last groan of resistance, the hatch grated partway open. Selim\n> laughed and tossed the curved worm fang into the interior, where it\n> made a tinkling clatter on the metal floor. He squirmed through into\n> the station, heard the muffled roar of the sandstorm increasing\n> outside. It was on top of him.\n>\n> Impeded by wind and blown sand, Selim grasped the lip of the hatch and\n> pushed hard. Incoming sand fell through a grating in the floor, into a\n> receptacle below. He needed to hurry. The wind let up for only a\n> second, but that was enough. He got the door shut, sealing himself in,\n> away from the violent weather.\n>\n> Safe . . . unbelievably safe. He laughed at his good fortune, then\n> gave a prayer of thanks, more sincere than any he had uttered in his\n> life. How could he question such blessings?\n>\n> Selim used the shaft of wan daylight to look around. Luckily, the\n> abandoned station had plaz windows. Though scratched and pitted from\n> prolonged exposure, they allowed fading illumination inside.\n>\n> The place was like a cave of treasure. Guided by the dust-filtered\n> light from the windows, he found a few old glowstrips which he coaxed\n> into brightening the small shelter. Then he ransacked cupboards and\n> storage vaults. Much of what remained was useless: unreadable\n> data-plaques, dead computerized recording systems, strange instruments\n> that bore the names of archaic corporations. He did, however, find\n> capsules of well-preserved food that had not deteriorated even in all\n> the time this facility had been abandoned.\n>\n> He broke open a capsule and ate the contents. Though the flavors were\n> unusual, the food tasted wonderful, and he felt energy seeping back\n> into his weary flesh. Other containers held concentrated juices, which\n> were like ambrosia to him. Most valuable of all, he found distilled\n> water, hundreds of literjons of it. Undoubtedly it had been collected\n> over the centuries by automated moisture extractors left behind by the\n> long-ago scientific expedition.\n>\n> This was personal wealth beyond anything Selim had imagined possible.\n> He could pay back the brackish water he'd been accused of taking from\n> the tribe a thousand times over. He could return to the Zensunni as a\n> hero. Naib Dhartha would have to forgive him. But Selim had never\n> committed the crime in the first place.\n>\n> While Selim sat comfortable and satisfied, he vowed never to give\n> Dhartha the satisfaction of seeing him return. Ebrahim had betrayed\n> his friendship, and the corrupt Naib had falsely condemned him. His\n> own people had exiled him, never expecting him to survive. Now that he\n> had found a way to live by himself, why would Selim ever want to go\n> back and surrender it all?\n>\n> For two straight nights, the young man slept. At dawn on the second\n> day he awoke and opened more of the sealed boxes and cabinets. He\n> discovered tools, rope, durable fabric, construction material. The\n> possibilities filled him with joy, and Selim found himself chuckling\n> all alone inside the botanical testing station.\n>\n> *I'm alive!*\n>\n> The storm had rattled past as he slept, unsuccessfully scratching\n> against the walls of the shelter like a monster trying to get in. Most\n> of the sand had been deflected, so very little was piled around the\n> enclosure. From the vantage of the station's largest window, Selim\n> gazed across the desert sea that he had crossed on the back of the\n> sandworm. The dunes were fresh and spotless. All signs of the dead\n> worm had been erased, scoured clean. Only this solitary young man\n> remained.\n>\n> He envisioned a long journey ahead of him, and thought he must have a\n> particular calling. Why else would Buddallah have gone to so much\n> trouble to allow poor Selim to live?\n>\n> *What do you want me to do?*\n>\n> Smiling, the outcast looked out upon the desert, wondering how he\n> could possibly cross such an expanse again. The vista filled him with\n> a sensation of supreme solitude. He made out a few rocks in the\n> distance, etched by eternal winds. Here and there were a few hardy\n> plants. Small animals scurried into burrows. Dune merged into dune,\n> desert into desert.\n>\n> Enthralled by his own memories and feeling recklessly invulnerable,\n> Selim decided what he must do, sooner or later. The first time had\n> been an incredible fluke, but he understood better how to do it now.\n>\n> He must ride a sandworm again. And the next time it would not be an\n> accident.\n>\n> *One of the questions the Butlerian Jihad answered with violence was\n> whether the human body is simply a machine that a* man-made *machine\n> can duplicate.

RAJID SUK,\n\n*Post-Trauma Analysis of the Human Species*\n\n> **W**earing a new warrior-form designed to strike terror into the\n> humans on Giedi Prime, Agamemnon strode on armored legs through the\n> broken industries and flaming ruins of the city. The *hrethgir* hadn't\n> stood a chance.\n>\n> Giedi Prime had been conquered easily.\n>\n> The invading machine troops plodded forward, targeting habitation\n> complexes and setting them aflame, blasting parks into blackened\n> fields. In accordance with Agamemnon's orders--- citing the glory of\n> Omnius--- the neo-cymeks and robotic warriors left the Giedi City\n> industries essentially intact.\n>\n> Agamemnon had sworn that Giedi Prime would make up for the cymeks'\n> humiliation on Salusa. Even now, watcheyes flew overhead, recording\n> the carnage, seeing how efficiently the two Titans guided the military\n> operation.\n>\n> Accompanied by his comrade Barbarossa, Agamemnon scanned the\n> topography of the metropolis and located the Magnus's magnificent\n> residence. It was an appropriate place to establish the new center of\n> Synchronized government, a symbolic gesture of domination as well as\n> an affront to the defeated populace.\n>\n> The cymek general's warrior-form was the most monstrous multilegged\n> system he had ever conceived. Electrical discharges fired through\n> artificial muscles, pulling fiber cables taut and moving\n> weapon-studded limbs. He flexed his flowmetal claws and crushed\n> construction blocks in his grip,\n>\n> imagining them to be the skulls of enemies. Following in his own\n> ferocious configuration, Barbarossa laughed at the showmanship.\n>\n> Marching forward on many limbs, the cymeks thundered through the\n> wreckage-strewn streets. Nothing stood in the way of these former\n> warlords. The situation reminded both of them of a thousand years\n> before, when twenty Titans had conquered the Old Empire by trampling\n> the bodies of their foes.\n>\n> This was the way it should be. It only whetted their appetite for\n> more.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> PRIOR TO THE attack, Agamemnon had studied Giedi Prime's defenses,\n> analyzing images taken by spy watcheyes that zoomed through the system\n> like tiny meteoroids. From those readings, the cymek general had\n> concocted a brilliant tactical move, exploiting a slight weakness in\n> planetary defenses. Omnius had been willing to pay the necessary price\n> to take over a League World, and it had not cost the life of a single\n> Titan, not even one of the lesser neo-cymeks. Only a single robotic\n> cruiser. Perfectly acceptable, as far as Agamemnon was concerned.\n>\n> The humans had erected scrambler fields here like those on Salusa,\n> centering their transmitting towers in Giedi City. The field-generator\n> facility had been guarded by kindjal fighter craft, supposedly\n> impregnable embankments, and massively armored ground vehicles. The\n> feral humans had learned a lesson on Salusa Secundus. But it was not\n> enough to protect them from obliteration.\n>\n> Giedi Prime's first-line orbital protective forces had been brushed\n> aside by the unstoppable force of the giant machine fleet. All robot\n> losses were acceptable. When Agamemnon led the cymek ships in, along\n> with the sacrificial cruisers, the planetbound human defenders could\n> not hope to drive them back.\n>\n> To begin the assault, the huge robotic cruiser had positioned itself\n> above Giedi Prime, its cargo holds filled with explosives. Dozens of\n> other robot\n>\n> cruisers moved with machine grace, sleek and streamlined, lining up\n> for the assault. Guided by a thinking machine intelligence, the\n> enormous craft fired its engines and accelerated at full speed toward\n> its target.\n>\n> \"Descent approach in progress,\" the battleship's robot mind had\n> reported, transmitting images to the waiting fighters. Ahead, thirty\n> decoy vessels shot downward, also hoping to strike the target but\n> designed to be targets for the ground-based missile defenses. The plan\n> relied on brute force and overwhelming numbers, not finesse.\n> Nevertheless, it would be effective.\n>\n> With its engines at full speed, the sacrificial vessel had accelerated\n> white-hot into Giedi Prime's atmosphere, faster than any ground-based\n> human missile defenses could target and respond. The other cruisers\n> approached the invisible scrambler shield. Already, gray-white\n> blossoms of smoke and explosions marked where the ground-launched\n> missiles had found targets. The numbers dwindled, as did the distance.\n> The humans could never stop all the invaders.\n>\n> The doomed robot ship sent final images back to the watcheyes so\n> Omnius would have a complete record of the conquest of Giedi Prime.\n> Every nanosecond--- until it passed through the scrambler net, which\n> effectively erased the AI guidance brain. The transmissions became\n> static, then an empty carrier wave.\n>\n> Still, the juggernaut had continued to descend. Even with its\n> gelcircuitry brain neutralized, the plummeting cruiser fell like an\n> asteroidsized hammer.\n>\n> Kindjal fighter craft directly engaged the last explosive-laden\n> vessel, but the inbound ship was too big and too hot to be swerved.\n> The defenders' shots amounted to little more than pellets.\n>\n> The giant dead vessel slammed into the field transmitters on the\n> outskirts of Giedi City. A crater half a kilometer wide flashed into\n> steam; the transmitters, the overwhelmed defenses, and the surrounding\n> inhabited areas all vanished.\n>\n> Shockwaves had toppled buildings for kilometers around and shattered\n> windows. Holtzman's scrambler shields were neutralized in the blink of\n> an eye, and the Giedi Home Guard was crippled.\n>\n> After that, the cymeks and robots had come down in full force.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> \"BARBAROSSA, MY FRIEND, shall we make our grand entrance?\" Agamemnon\n> said, arriving at the residence of the Magnus.\n>\n> \"Just like when we followed Tlaloc into the halls of the Old Empire,\"\n> his fellow Titan agreed. \"It has been a long time since I've enjoyed a\n> victory so much.\"\n>\n> They led enthusiastic neo-cymeks easily through the reeling\n> metropolis. The stunned human inhabitants could not even put up a\n> fight. Behind the cymek conquerors marched robotic troops to help\n> secure the territory.\n>\n> Although part of Giedi Prime's population might flee underground and\n> hide, the citizenry would break, given time. It might take years to\n> root out the last cells of feral resistance. No doubt the conquering\n> machines would endure decades of guerrilla strikes by misguided\n> vigilantes, survivors of the Giedi Home Guard who thought a few\n> gnat-bites would make the invaders pack up and go away. Resistance\n> groups would be a futile exercise, but he had no doubt the locals\n> would try some such foolishness.\n>\n> Agamemnon wondered if he should bring in Ajax to complete the cleanup.\n> The brutal cymek warlord particularly enjoyed hunting humans, as he\n> had proved so effectively during the Hrethgir Rebellions on Walgis. As\n> soon as they installed a copy of the evermind in the ashes of Giedi\n> City, Agamemnon would make appropriate recommendations to the new\n> incarnation of Omnius.\n>\n> Agamemnon and Barbarossa smashed open the front of the governor's\n> residence, clearing an area wide enough for their reinforced bodies.\n> In their wake, soldier robots, much smaller than the cymeks'\n> warrior-forms, flooded\n>\n> into the building. Within moments, the robots brought blond-haired\n> Magnus Sumi before the two Titans.\n>\n> \"We claim your planet in the name of Omnius,\" Barbarossa declared.\n> \"Giedi Prime is now a Synchronized World. We require your cooperation\n> to consolidate our victory.\"\n>\n> Magnus Sumi, trembling with fear, nevertheless spat on the broken\n> floor where the weight of the cymek warrior-forms had crushed his\n> carefully laid tiles.\n>\n> \"Bow to us,\" Barbarossa said.\n>\n> The Magnus laughed. \"You're mad. I would never---\"\n>\n> Agamemnon swung one of his sleek metal arms sideways. He had not fully\n> tested this new body and was not aware of the magnitude of his\n> strength. He had meant to strike the governor in the face, an\n> instinctive angry slap. Instead, the arm delivered a blow so forceful\n> that it ripped the man's torso in half. The two parts of his body\n> thudded against the far wall in a splatter of gore.\n>\n> \"Oh, well. My demand was a mere formality anyway.\" Agamemnon turned\n> optic threads toward his comrade. \"Begin your work, Barbarossa. These\n> robots will assist.\"\n>\n> The Titan programming genius began dismantling the household systems\n> in the governor's residence and setting up power conduits and\n> machinery. He added linkages and installed a blank, resilient\n> gelsphere mainframe into which he uploaded the newest version of\n> Omnius's mind.\n>\n> The process took several hours, during which the thinking machine\n> invasion force moved through the city, putting out fires and shoring\n> up damaged industrial buildings that Agamemnon considered important\n> for the planet's continued utility.\n>\n> The habitation complexes of the surviving humans, though, were left to\n> burn. The suffering people could fend for themselves. Misery would\n> help them understand the hopelessness of their position.\n>\n> Floating overhead, the annoying watcheyes recorded everything. At\n> least it was a victory this time. Agamemnon revealed no sign of his\n> impatience or displeasure, knowing that resistance against the\n> computer evermind would be fruitless. *For now*. Instead, he must\n> select the proper place and time.\n>\n> Once installed and activated, the new incarnation of Omnius would show\n> no appreciation toward the two seemingly loyal Titans for their\n> victory, nor would the evermind begrudge the loss of his machine\n> juggernaut. It was a military operation well executed, and the\n> Synchronized Worlds had now added one of humanity's jewels to its\n> empire. A psychological and strategic success.\n>\n> When the immense download was finally complete, Agamemnon activated\n> the new copy of the distributed evermind. Systems surged alive, and\n> the omniscient computer began to survey its new domain.\n>\n> \"Welcome, Lord Omnius,\" Agamemnon said to the wallspeakers. \"I present\n> to you the gift of another world.\"\n>\n> *We are happiest when planning our futures, letting our optimism and\n> imagination run unrestrained.

The couple sampled prized wines from dusty\n> bottles brought in by the scions of every household. Xavier, who could\n> taste none of the subtleties in the vintages, took care not to get too\n> drunk; he was already giddy at the prospect of his upcoming marriage.\n>\n> Serena's sister Octa, two years younger, seemed equally excited. With\n> her long chestnut hair adorned by fresh cornflowers, Octa's eyes were\n> wide\n>\n> with amazement, enchanted by her sister's beau and fantasizing about a\n> handsome young officer who might be her own husband one day.\n>\n> Amazingly, Serena's reclusive mother Livia came to spend the\n> celebratory weekend at the Butler manor. Manion's wife rarely left the\n> City of Introspection, a retreat where she kept herself from the cares\n> and nightmares of the world. The enlightened philosophical preserve,\n> owned by a Butler trust, had originally been established to study and\n> ponder the Zen Hekiganshu of III Delta Pavonis, the Tawrah and\n> Talmudic Zabur, even the Obeah Ritual. But under Butler patronage, the\n> City had gradually blossomed into something the likes of which had not\n> been seen for millennia.\n>\n> Xavier had not seen Serena's mother often, especially in recent years.\n> With her tanned skin and lean features, Livia Butler was a handsome\n> beauty. She rejoiced in the betrothal of her daughter and seemed to\n> enjoy herself as she danced with her jovial husband or sat beside him\n> at the banquet table. She looked not at all like a woman who had fled\n> from the world.\n>\n> Years ago, Livia and Manion's strong marriage had been envied by many\n> noble families. Serena was their eldest child, but they also had twins\n> two years younger: the calm and shy Octa and a sensitive, intelligent\n> boy, Fredo. While Serena underwent political schooling, the twins were\n> raised as close companions, though neither had the far-ranging\n> aspirations of their older sister.\n>\n> Fredo had been fascinated by musical instruments and folk songs,\n> traditions from the grandest planets of the former Empire. He learned\n> to be a musician and poet, while Octa was intrigued with painting and\n> sculpture. In Salusan society, artisans and creative people were\n> highly respected, as admirable as any politician.\n>\n> But at the age of fourteen, honey-voiced Fredo died of a wasting\n> disease, his skin splotched with purplish discolorations. For months,\n> he'd grown thinner and thinner, his muscles atrophying. His blood\n> would not clot, and he could not keep even the thinnest of broths in\n> his stomach. The Salusan\n>\n> doctors had never seen anything like it. Frantic, Viceroy Butler\n> begged the League for help.\n>\n> The men of Rossak offered a number of experimental drugs from their\n> fungoid jungles to treat Fredo's undiagnosed malady. Livia insisted on\n> trying everything. Unfortunately, the young man reacted poorly to the\n> third Rossak drug, an allergic response that caused his throat to\n> swell. Fredo went into convulsions and stopped breathing.\n>\n> Octa had mourned the loss of her brother and came to fear for her own\n> life as well. Fredo's disease was eventually determined to be\n> genetically based, meaning that she and her older sister were at risk\n> of contracting the fatal malady themselves. Octa took care with her\n> health and lived each day dreading that her life would come to a slow,\n> painful end like that of her brother.\n>\n> Fiercely confident and optimistic, Serena always tried to console her\n> sister, giving her a shoulder to cry on, offering encouragement.\n> Though neither sister had shown signs of the strange disease, Octa's\n> dreams had lost all momentum, and she gave up her artwork, becoming a\n> quieter, more pensive soul. She was a frail teenager now, hoping for a\n> spark of wonder to bring her back to the fullness of life.\n>\n> Though her husband had a brilliant political career and his importance\n> grew with each season, formerly vivacious Livia had withdrawn from\n> public life to her spiritual retreat, where she focused on\n> philosophical and religious pursuits. She donated large sums to the\n> imposing fortress to build additional meditation chambers, temples,\n> and libraries. After devoting many sleepless nights to frank\n> discussions with the Cogitor Kwyna, Livia became the Abbess of the\n> facility.\n>\n> In the aftermath of the tragedy, Manion Butler had immersed himself in\n> League work, while Serena felt a heavier burden and set higher goals.\n> Though she could do nothing to help her brother, she wanted to stop\n> the suffering of other people whenever she could. She plunged into\n> politics, working to stop the practice of human slavery still common\n> on some\n>\n> League Worlds, and pledging herself to finding a way to overthrow the\n> thinking machines. No one had ever accused her of lacking in vision or\n> energy. . . .\n>\n> Living separate lives now, Manion and Livia Butler remained pillars of\n> Salusan society, proud of each other's accomplishments--- not\n> divorced, not even emotionally separated . . . just following\n> different paths.

Manion\n> sat beside his wife, rocking her gently.\n>\n> At the event in their honor, Xavier and Serena had by now experienced\n> their fill of company and revelry, of greeting guests and sampling\n> food and wine. They laughed at every witticism, whether subtle or\n> crude, so as not to offend the grand families. By now, the two were\n> desperate for just a few moments alone.\n>\n> Finally they slipped away and hurried through the corridors of the\n> manor house, past hot kitchens and musty storerooms, to a small alcove\n> outside the Winter Sun room. In winter, slanted sunshine lit this room\n> with bronze rainbows. The Butler family traditionally took their\n> breakfasts here during the cold season, enjoying family conversation\n> while they watched the rising sun. It was a place of fond memories for\n> Serena.\n>\n> She crowded with Xavier into the alcove just outside the room;\n> glow-panels shone in the hall, but still allowed a few rich shadows.\n> Serena pulled him close and kissed him. He placed a hand behind her\n> neck and stroked her\n>\n> hair as he pulled her face close to his and kissed more deeply, hungry\n> for her.\n>\n> When they heard hurried footsteps in the hall, the lovers hid in\n> silence, quietly chuckling at their secret rendezvous. But fresh-faced\n> Octa easily found them. Flushed with embarrassment, Octa averted her\n> gaze. \"You must come back to the banquet hall. Father is ready to\n> serve dessert. And an offworld messenger is coming.\"\n>\n> \"A messenger?\" Xavier suddenly sounded military and formal. \"From\n> whom?\"\n>\n> \"He went to Zimia demanding an audience with the League Parliament,\n> but since most of the nobles are here for the banquet, he's on his way\n> up the hill.\"\n>\n> Bending his elbows outward, Xavier offered an arm to each sister. \"Let\n> us go together so we can hear what this messenger has to say.\" Forcing\n> a lighthearted tone, he said, \"After all, I haven't eaten enough\n> today. I could use a bowl of roast custard and a whole plateful of\n> candied eggs.\"\n>\n> Octa giggled, but Serena gave him a mock stern frown. \"I suppose I\n> must resign myself to life with a fat husband.\"\n>\n> They entered the large hall, where the guests gathered around a long\n> table, complimenting the array of extraordinarily beautiful desserts\n> that looked too precious to be eaten. Manion and Livia Butler stood\n> side by side, raising a toast to the couple.\n>\n> Sipping politely from his wine, Xavier detected an undercurrent of\n> worry in the Viceroy's manner. Everyone pretended to be unconcerned\n> about what news the messenger might bring, but the moment a pounding\n> sounded on the door, all activity stopped. Manion Butler himself\n> opened the wooden portal, gesturing for the man to enter.\n>\n> He wasn't a formal courier. His eyes were haunted and his officer's\n> uniform unkempt, as if he no longer cared about protocol or\n> appearances. Xavier\n>\n> recognized the insignia of the Giedi Prime Home Guard. Like other\n> League uniforms, it bore the gold sigil of free humanity on the lapel.\n>\n> \"I have grave news, Viceroy Butler. The fastest ships have brought me\n> directly here.\"\n>\n> \"What is it, young man?\" Manion's voice was filled with dread.\n>\n> \"Giedi Prime has fallen to the thinking machines!\" The officer raised\n> his voice against the guests' disbelieving outcries. \"The robots and\n> cymeks found a flaw in our defenses and destroyed our scrambler-field\n> transmitters. Much of our population has been slaughtered and the\n> survivors enslaved. A new Omnius evermind has already been activated.\"\n>\n> The people in the hall wailed at hearing of the devastating defeat.\n> Xavier clutched Serena's hand so tightly he feared he might hurt her.\n> Inside, he had turned to stone, his stomach filled with a cold\n> heaviness.\n>\n> He had just been to Giedi Prime, had inspected the defenses himself.\n> Xavier had been terribly anxious to finish his inspection tour so that\n> he could return to Serena. Could he possibly have missed something? He\n> squeezed his eyes shut as the questions and disbelieving comments\n> turned to a buzz around him. Was he to blame? Had a simple mistake, a\n> bit of impatience from a young man in love, caused an entire planet to\n> fall?\n>\n> Manion Butler placed both palms on the table to steady himself. Livia\n> reached over to touch her husband's shoulder, adding silent support.\n> She closed her eyes, and her lips moved as if in prayer.\n>\n> The Viceroy spoke. \"Another free planet lost to the Synchronized\n> Worlds, and one of our strongholds, too.\" He straightened, took a\n> shuddering breath. \"We must call an immediate war council, summon all\n> representatives.\" With a meaningful glance at Serena, he added, \"Let\n> us also include anyone who speaks for the Unallied Planets and wishes\n> to join us in this fight.\"\n>\n> *Everything in the universe contains flaws, ourselves included.

In a petulant\n> attempt to slight him, she smashed a set of tiny hollownut sculptures\n> he had given her during their courtship and genetic testing.\n>\n> Still, he stepped forward, as if immune to her ferine outbursts. In\n> the hall behind him, muted voices urged caution, but he ignored them.\n> He came to her pallet, smiling with compassion and understanding.\n>\n> Venport knelt beside the bed, stroking her sweaty hand. He whispered\n> soothing nonsense in her ears. She couldn't understand his words, but\n> she grasped his fingers until she expected to feel the bones snap. But\n> he remained frustratingly close, not intimidated by her in the least.\n>\n> Zufa hurled accusations of treachery at him. \"I can sense your\n> thoughts! I know you're thinking only of yourself.\"\n>\n> Her imagination concocted schemes, attributing them to his\n> deviousness. If the great Zufa Cenva was no longer there to protect\n> him, who would keep this man as a pet? Who would care for him? She\n> doubted he could take care of himself.\n>\n> Then, with greater fear:*Or could he?*\n>\n> Venport had sent Norma off on a long journey to Poritrin, arranging\n> everything behind Zufa's back, as if he believed that a man like Tio\n> Holtzman truly wanted to work with her daughter. What was he planning?\n> She gritted her teeth, wanting to prove that she understood his\n> intentions. Her threats came as sharp gasps. \"You can't . . . let me\n> die, bastard! No one . . . else would . . . have you!\"\n>\n> Instead, he looked at her, coolly patronizing. \"You've told me many\n> times that I come from a good genetic line, my darling. But I do not\n> desire someone else among the Sorceresses. I prefer to stay with you.\"\n> He lowered his voice, looking at her with an oddly intense love that\n> she could not quite fathom. \"I understand you better than you do\n> yourself, Zufa Cenva. Always pushing, constantly demanding more than\n> anyone can possibly give. Nobody--- not even you--- can be perfect all\n> the time.\"\n>\n> With a final prolonged shriek, she expelled her deformed, resistant\n> fetus, a monstrously abnormal creature. Seeing the bright blood,\n> Venport bellowed for assistance, and two brave midwives scurried into\n> the chamber. One reached down with a towel, placing it over the fetus\n> like a shroud, while the other bathed Zufa's skin, adding pain-numbing\n> salves distilled from jungle spores. Venport sent for the best drugs\n> from his own stockpiles.\n>\n> Finally, he took the squirming fetus himself, holding the bloody\n> larval thing in his hands. It had dark skin and strange mottled spots\n> that made it look as if proto-eyes had grown all over its limbless\n> body. He saw the thing twitch a final time, then it stopped moving.\n>\n> He wrapped it up in the towel, trying to ignore the tear in his eye.\n> His expression stony, Venport handed the corrupt fetus to one of the\n> midwives,\n>\n> saying nothing. It would be taken out into the jungles, and no one\n> would ever see it again.\n>\n> The exhausted Sorceress lay back, shuddering, just now beginning to\n> feel a sense of reality and despair again. The miscarriage had hurt\n> her, leaving her with a deep sadness that went beyond the goals of any\n> breeding program. Her vision returned to focus, and she noticed the\n> psychokinetic destruction she had caused in the room. It all spoke of\n> weakness, of lack of control.\n>\n> This was her third horrific miscarriage from mating with Venport. Deep\n> disappointment and anger boiled inside her. \"I chose you for your\n> bloodline, Aurelius,\" she muttered through dry lips. \"What went\n> wrong?\"\n>\n> He looked at her, still expressionless, as if his passion had been\n> washed away. \"Genetics is not an exact science.\"\n>\n> Zufa closed her eyes. \"Failures, always failures.\" She was the\n> greatest Sorceress of Rossak, and yet she had endured so many\n> disappointments. Sighing with disgust, Zufa thought of her stunted\n> daughter, not wanting to believe that the ugly dwarf was the best she\n> could achieve.\n>\n> Venport shook his head, uncharacteristically stern and impatient now\n> that the danger was past. \"You have had successes, Zufa. You just\n> don't know how to recognize them.\"\n>\n> She forced herself to rest, to recuperate. Eventually, Zufa would have\n> to try again, but with someone else.\n>\n> *Overly organized research is confining, and guaranteed to produce\n> nothing new.*\n>\n> --- TIO HOLTZMAN,\n\nletter to Lord Niko Bludd\n\n> **A**rriving on Poritrin at the conclusion of her first long space\n> voyage, Norma Cenva felt out of place. Her diminutive form drew\n> glances, but was not so unusual that people turned pitying stares upon\n> her. On the Unallied Planets there was a variety of races, some with\n> stunted statures. She didn't care about the opinions of others anyway.\n> She only wanted to impress Tio Holtzman.\n>\n> Before Norma's departure from Rossak, her aloof mother had looked down\n> at her with dismissive puzzlement. Zufa chose to believe that the\n> brilliant Savant had made a mistake or had misread one of Norma's\n> theoretical papers. She expected her daughter to return home before\n> long.\n>\n> Aurelius Venport had made all of the arrangements, used his own\n> profits to pay for a nicer cabin than Holtzman had offered. While her\n> mother continued to work with the Sorceress trainees, Venport had\n> accompanied Norma to the docking-transfer stations in Rossak orbit. He\n> had given her a gift of delicately petrified flowers and a chaste hug\n> before she'd climbed aboard the vessel. With a wry smile, he told her,\n> \"All of us disappointments need to stick together.\"\n>\n> Norma held onto that warm but troubling comment during the long\n> journey to Poritrin. . . .\n>\n> When the shuttle landed in the river-delta city of Starda, Norma\n> carefully inserted Venport's petrified flowers into her mousy brown\n> hair, a sprig of beauty that contrasted with the plainness of her wide\n> face, large head, and rounded nose. She wore a loose blouse and\n> comfortable hose, both woven from fernfibers.\n>\n> Jostled by other passengers crowded at the shuttle hatch, the girl\n> carried only a small travel pack. Climbing down the ramp, Norma felt\n> flushed and eager to meet the scientist she admired, a thinker who\n> took her seriously. She had heard many stories of Savant Holtzman's\n> mathematical prowess, and she would be hard pressed to contribute\n> anything the great man hadn't already developed. She hoped she would\n> not let him down.\n>\n> Scanning the waiting crowd, she immediately recognized the eminent\n> scientist. A clean-shaven man with shoulder-length gray hair, Holtzman\n> appeared to be in his late middle years. His hands and fingernails\n> were clean, his clothing impeccable and ornamented with stylish\n> designs and badges.\n>\n> He greeted her with a broad smile and open arms that let the sleeves\n> of his white robe droop. \"Welcome to Poritrin, Miss Cenva.\" Holtzman\n> placed both hands on her shoulders in formal greeting. If he\n> experienced any disappointment upon seeing Norma's stature and coarse,\n> unattractive features, he did not show it. \"I certainly hope you've\n> brought your imagination with you.\" He gestured toward a doorway. \"We\n> have a lot of work to do together.\"\n>\n> He steered her through the spaceport crowds, away from their curious\n> stares, then took her away from Starda Spaceport in a private\n> limo-barge that floated high above the graceful Isana River.\n>\n> \"Poritrin is a peaceful world, where I can let my mind wander and\n> think of things that might save the human race.\" Holtzman smiled\n> proudly at her. \"I'm expecting that of you, too.\"\n>\n> \"I will do my best, Savant Holtzman.\"\n>\n> \"What more could any person ask?\"\n>\n> The skies of Poritrin held a gauze of clouds painted citrus yellow\n> with afternoon sunlight. The barge drifted above the multifingered\n> streamlets that wrapped around shifting islands and sandbars.\n> Traditional boats rode the current of the broad river, loaded with\n> grains and cargo for distribution\n>\n> in the port city and export offworld. Fertile Poritrin fed many\n> less-fortunate planets, in return for which they received raw\n> materials, equipment, manufactured goods, and human slaves to add to\n> their labor force.\n>\n> Some of the largest buildings in the spaceport were actually boats on\n> pontoons, anchored to the bases of sandstone bluffs. The roofs were\n> composed of layered shingles of silver-blue metal, smelted in mines\n> far to the north.\n>\n> He gestured to a bluff overlooking the crowded portions of blue-roofed\n> Starda, where she could recognize the influences of classic\n> Navachristian architecture. \"My laboratories are up there. Buildings\n> and supply sheds, quarters for my slaves and solvers, as well as my\n> own home--- everything built into that double spire of rock.\"\n>\n> The floating transport circled toward two sections of stone, like\n> adjacent fingers rising above the riverbed. She could see sheetplaz\n> windows, awning-covered balconies, and a walkway that linked a dome on\n> one spire with a conical stone tower and outbuildings on the other.\n>\n> Holtzman was pleased to note the amazement on her face. \"We have\n> quarters for you, Norma, in addition to private lab facilities and a\n> team of assistants to perform calculations based upon your theories. I\n> expect you to keep them all very busy.\"\n>\n> Norma looked at him, puzzled. \"Someone else to do the mathematics?\"\n>\n> \"Of course!\" Holtzman brushed iron-gray hair away from his face and\n> adjusted his white robe. \"You're an *idea* person, like me. We want\n> you to develop concepts, not bother with full-fledged implementation.\n> You should not waste time performing tedious arithmetic. Any\n> halfway-trained person can do that. It's what slaves are for.\"\n>\n> When the floating barge settled onto a glazed-tile deck, servants\n> emerged to take Norma's bags and offer the two of them cool drinks.\n> Like an eager boy, Holtzman led Norma to his impressive laboratories.\n> The large rooms were filled with water clocks and magnetic sculptures\n> in which spheres orbited\n>\n> about electrical paths without wires or gears. Sketches and\n> half-finished drawings covered electrostatic boards, surrounded by\n> serpentine calculations that went nowhere.\n>\n> Glancing around, Norma realized that Holtzman had abandoned more\n> concepts than she had ever created in her life. Even so, many of the\n> cluttered papers and geometric drawings looked a bit old. Some of the\n> ink had faded, and papers were curled around the edges.\n>\n> With a swish of his wide sleeves, Holtzman gave the intriguing items a\n> dismissive wave. \"Just toys, useless gadgets that I keep for my\n> amusement.\" He poked a finger at one of the floating silver balls,\n> which sent the other model planets into dangerous orbits, spinning\n> about like heavenly bodies out of control. \"Sometimes I dabble with\n> them for inspiration, but usually they only make me think of other\n> toys, not the weapons of mass destruction we need in order to save us\n> from the tyranny of machines.\"\n>\n> With a distracted frown, Holtzman continued, \"My work is constrained\n> in that I cannot use sophisticated computers. In order to perform the\n> enormous calculations required to test a theory, I have no recourse\n> but to rely upon human mental abilities and hope for the best from the\n> fallible calculational skills of trained people. Come, let me show you\n> the solvers.\"\n>\n> He led her to a well-illuminated chamber with high windows. Inside,\n> numerous identical benches and flat tabletops had been set up in a\n> grid layout. Workers hunched over each writing surface using handheld\n> calculation devices. From their drab garments and dull expressions,\n> Norma judged that these men and women must be some of Poritrin's\n> numerous slaves.\n>\n> \"This is the only way we can imitate the abilities of a thinking\n> machine,\" Holtzman explained. \"A computer can handle billions of\n> iterations. We have a harder time of it, yet with enough people\n> working in concert and as specialists, we accomplish billions of\n> calculations on our own. It just takes longer.\"\n>\n> He walked down the narrow aisles between the solvers, who were\n> furiously scribing numbers and mathematical symbols on flat slates,\n> checking and double-checking answers before passing them on to the\n> next person in line.\n>\n> \"Even the most complex math can be broken into a sequence of trivial\n> steps. Each of these slaves has been trained to complete specific\n> equations in an assembly-line fashion. When taken together, this\n> collective human mind is capable of remarkable feats.\" Holtzman\n> surveyed the room as if he expected his solvers to give him a\n> resounding cheer. Instead, they studied their work with heavy-lidded\n> eyes, moving through equation after equation with no comprehension of\n> reasons or larger pictures.\n>\n> Norma felt sympathy for them, having been belittled and ignored for so\n> long herself. She knew intellectually that human slavery was a way of\n> life on many League Worlds, as it was throughout the machine-ruled\n> planets. Nevertheless, she supposed that these workers would prefer\n> doing mental work to heavy labor out in the agricultural fields.\n>\n> With a magnanimous gesture, the scientist said, \"Every solver is at\n> your disposal, Norma, whenever you develop a theory that needs\n> verification. The next stage, of course is to build prototypes for\n> further testing and development. We have plenty of labs and test\n> facilities, but the most important work comes first.\" He tapped a\n> fingertip on his own forehead. *\"Up here.\"*\n>\n> Holtzman gave her a cockeyed grin and lowered his voice. \"Mistakes are\n> possible, of course, even at our level. If that happens, we hope that\n> Lord Niko Bludd is tolerant enough to keep us around.\"\n>\n> *Only those with narrow minds fail to see that the definition of\n> Impossible is 'Lack of imagination and incentive.'*\n>\n> --- SERENA BUTLER\n>\n> **I**n the front parlor of the Butler manor house, Xavier Harkonnen\n> shifted on a green brocaded settee. His duty uniform was not designed\n> for lounging in fine furniture. Ornate gold-framed paintings of Butler\n> ancestors adorned the walls, including one like a caricature of a\n> gentleman with a waxed handlebar mustache and a tricorner hat.\n>\n> Between tight duty shifts, he had rushed here to surprise Serena, and\n> the servants had asked him to wait. Blushing, Octa came into the\n> parlor, carrying a cool drink for him. Though he had always seen her\n> as Serena's little sister, Xavier realized with surprise that she was\n> actually a lovely young woman. With Serena's recent betrothal, Octa\n> might be dreaming of her own marriage, if she could ever overcome her\n> shy infatuation with him.\n>\n> \"Serena wasn't expecting you, but she'll be right out.\" Octa looked\n> away. \"She's in a meeting with official-looking men and women,\n> assistants carrying electronic equipment, a few Militia uniforms.\n> Something to do with her Parliament work, I think.\"\n>\n> Xavier gave a wan smile. \"We both have so many projects, but such\n> times demand it.\"\n>\n> While Octa occupied herself straightening books and statuettes on a\n> shelf, Xavier thought back to a Parliament session he had watched two\n> days before. Upset over the tragic fall of Giedi Prime, Serena had\n> tried to rally representatives from the strongest planets, hoping to\n> mount a rescue operation. She always wanted to *do* something; it was\n> one of the reasons Xavier loved her so much. While others accepted the\n> defeat and cringed in fear that Omnius would push for more conquests,\n> Serena wanted to charge in and save the world. Any world.\n>\n> Dressed in a long gown, she had spoken passionately in the temporary\n> Hall of Parliament. \"We can't just give up on Giedi Prime! The\n> thinking machines have penetrated the scrambler shields, killed the\n> Magnus, enslaved the people, and every day their presence grows\n> stronger. There have to be Home Guard survivors fighting behind the\n> machine lines, and we know that another shield-generator station was\n> nearly completed. Perhaps that can be made functional! We must fight\n> back before the thinking machines can establish their own\n> infrastructure. If we wait, they will become unassailable!\"\n>\n> \"As far as we know, they are already unassailable,\" grumbled the\n> representative from industrial Vertree Colony.\n>\n> The Zanbar official added, \"Bringing the Armada to Giedi Prime would\n> be suicide. Without their scrambler shields, they have no defenses\n> left, and the machines would slaughter us in a direct conflict.\"\n>\n> Serena had jabbed a finger at the nervous audience. \"Not necessarily.\n> If we could slip in and finish the work at the secondary\n> shield-generating complex, then project a new blanket of disruptor\n> fields, we could cut off---\"\n>\n> The League members had actually laughed at the suggestion. Seeing her\n> heartbroken expression, Xavier felt stung on Serena's behalf. But she\n> had not understood the difficulty of her na\u00efve suggestion, the\n> impossibility of restoring Giedi Prime's shields under the noses of\n> the machine conquerors. During his planetary inspection tour, Xavier\n> had learned that it could take days or weeks for engineers--- working\n> under the best of conditions--- to make the backup shield system\n> operational.\n>\n> But Serena never stopped trying. The ache of imagining so many\n> suffering humans drove her to it.\n>\n> The vote had gone overwhelmingly against her. \"We cannot spend the\n> resources, firepower, or personnel on an ill-advised mission to a\n> planet we have already lost. It is now a machine stronghold.\" The\n> nobles feared for their own local defenses.\n>\n> Such work occupied most of Xavier's time. As an Armada officer, he had\n> gone to extended sessions with officers and Parliament\n> representatives, including Viceroy Butler. Xavier was determined to\n> learn what had gone wrong with Giedi Prime's defenses--- and whether\n> he was to blame in some way.\n>\n> Armada tacticians had studied the inspection records and assured him\n> that he could have done nothing to prevent the takeover, short of\n> stationing a full fleet of battleships at every League World. If\n> Omnius was willing to sacrifice part of his robotic attack force to\n> bring down Holtzman's scrambler shields, no planet was safe. But the\n> information didn't make Xavier feel much better.\n>\n> On Poritrin, Tio Holtzman was working hard to improve the scrambler\n> system design. Lord Bludd expressed his optimism and confidence in the\n> Savant, especially since the inventor had brought in another\n> mathematician, the daughter of the Sorceress Zufa Cenva, to assist\n> him. Xavier hoped something could be done quickly enough to make a\n> difference. . . .\n>\n> Lovely but harried, Serena entered the parlor and hugged him. \"I had\n> no idea you were coming.\" Octa slipped out the side door.\n>\n> Xavier looked at the ornate clock on the mantel. \"I wanted to surprise\n> you, but I have to get back to duty. I have a long meeting this\n> afternoon.\"\n>\n> She nodded, preoccupied. \"Since the attack on Giedi Prime, we've all\n> been prisoners of our planning sessions. I think I've lost track of\n> how many committees I serve.\"\n>\n> Teasingly, he said, \"Should I have been invited to this mysterious\n> gathering?\"\n>\n> Her chuckle sounded forced. \"Oh? The League Armada doesn't give you\n> enough work, so you'd like to sit in on my tedious meetings as well?\n> Perhaps I should speak to your new commander.\"\n>\n> \"No thank you, my dear. I'd rather fight ten cymeks than try to\n> dissuade you when you've set your mind to something.\" Serena responded\n> to his kiss with surprising passion. He stepped back, breathing hard,\n> and straightened his uniform. \"I need to go.\"\n>\n> \"Can I make it up to you at dinner tonight? A little t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, just\n> the two of us?\" Her eyes sparkled. \"It's important to me, especially\n> now.\"\n>\n> \"I'll be there.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WITH A SIGH of relief after quelling Xavier's suspicions, Serena\n> returned to the Winter Sun Room where her team had gathered. She wiped\n> a sparkle of sweat from her forehead. Several faces turned toward her,\n> and she raised a hand to allay concerns.\n>\n> Late morning sunlight splashed across the chairs, the tile counters\n> and a breakfast table now strewn with plans, maps, and resource\n> charts. \"We've got to get back to work,\" said the grizzled veteran Ort\n> Wibsen. \"Don't have much time if you want to put this in motion.\"\n>\n> \"That is absolutely my intention, Commander Wibsen. Anybody with\n> doubts should have left us days ago.\"\n>\n> Serena's father believed that she spent her mornings in the bright,\n> cheery room just reading, but for weeks she had been exploring schemes\n> . . .\n>\n> gathering volunteers, expert personnel, and raw materials. No one\n> could stop Serena Butler from devoting her energies to humanitarian\n> work.\n>\n> \"I tried to follow proper channels and make the League take action,\"\n> she said, \"but sometimes people must be coerced into making the right\n> decision. They must be led to it, like a stubborn Salusan stallion.\"\n>\n> After the Parliament laughed at her \"na\u00efve foolishness,\" Serena had\n> marched out of the temporary meeting hall but did not accept defeat.\n> She\n>\n> decided to change tactics, even if she had to organize and finance a\n> mission herself.\n>\n> When Xavier learned of her plan, after it was too late to stop her,\n> she hoped he would be proud of her.\n>\n> Now she studied the team she had gathered from the Armada's most\n> overlooked experts in commando operations: captains, supply runners,\n> even infiltration specialists. Ten men and women turned to look at\n> her. She clicked a remote control switch to close the overhead\n> louvers. The brightness of the room diminished, though muted sunlight\n> continued to filter in.\n>\n> \"If we can reclaim Giedi Prime, it will be twice the moral victory\n> that the machines had,\" Serena said. \"We will show that they cannot\n> hold us.\"\n>\n> Wibsen looked as if he had never ceased fighting, though he had been\n> off active duty for over a decade. \"All of us are more than happy to\n> tackle a task that will have tangible results. I've been itching to\n> strike a blow against the damned machines.\"\n>\n> Ort Wibsen was an old space commander who had been forced to retire---\n> ostensibly because of his age. More likely it had to do with his\n> coarse personality, a penchant for arguing with superiors, and history\n> of ignoring the details of orders. In spite of his surliness he was\n> exactly the man Serena needed to lead a mission that other League\n> members would have declared insane, or at least unwise.\n>\n> \"Then this is your chance, Commander,\" she said.\n>\n> Pinquer Jibb, the curly-haired and still-haggard-looking messenger who\n> had fled the conquest of Giedi Prime to deliver his terrible news, sat\n> stiff-backed, looking around the room. \"I've provided you with all the\n> background material you need. I've compiled detailed reports. The\n> subsidiary shield-generator station was nearly finished when the\n> machines attacked the planet. We merely need to slip in and get it\n> running.\" His haunted eyes grew fiery. \"Plenty members of the Giedi\n> Home Guard must\n>\n> have survived. They'll be doing everything they can behind enemy\n> lines, but that won't be enough unless we help them.\"\n>\n> \"If we can get the secondary shield generators functional, the cymeks\n> and robots on the surface will fall to a concerted defense from the\n> Armada.\" She scanned the others in the room. \"Do you think we'll be\n> able to do that?\"\n>\n> Brigit Paterson, a masculine-looking woman, frowned. \"What makes you\n> think the Armada will join the fight? After my engineers get the job\n> done, how will we make sure the military comes in to save our butts?\"\n>\n> Serena gave her a grim smile. \"You leave that to me.\"\n>\n> Serena had been raised with the best schools and tutors, groomed to\n> become a leader. With so much that needed to be done, she could not\n> sit in a comfortable manor house and fail to use the Butler wealth and\n> power.\n>\n> Now she was about to put that determination to the test. \"Commander\n> Wibsen, do you have the information I requested?\"\n>\n> With his deeply creased face and rough voice, the veteran seemed more\n> like a man of the outdoors than an intricate strategist. But no one in\n> Zimia knew more about military operations than he did.\n>\n> \"Some of it's good, some of it's bad. After crushing the government in\n> Giedi City, the machines kept a robot fleet in orbit. Mop-up work on\n> the ground is being led by one Titan and a lot of neo-cymeks.\" He\n> coughed, scowled, and adjusted a medication dispenser implanted in his\n> sternum.\n>\n> \"Omnius can keep sending in more machines, or even manufacture\n> reinforcements using the captured industries of Giedi Prime,\" said\n> Pinquer Jibb, his voice urgent. \"Unless we get the secondary shield\n> complex working.\"\n>\n> \"Then that's what we have to do,\" Serena said. \"The Home Guard was\n> dispersed across the settled continent, and many of the outlying\n> regiments\n>\n> seem to have gone underground to form a fifth column. If we can\n> contact them, organize them, we might be able to damage the machine\n> conquerors.\"\n>\n> \"I can help with that,\" Jibb insisted. \"It's our only chance.\"\n>\n> \"I still think it's foolhardy,\" Wibsen said. \"But what the hell. I\n> didn't say I wasn't going to go.\"\n>\n> \"Is the ship ready?\" Serena asked, impatient.\n>\n> \"It is, but there's a great deal lacking in this operation, if you ask\n> me.\"\n>\n> Brigit Paterson said to Serena, \"I have secured detailed maps, plans,\n> and blueprints of all aspects of Giedi Prime and Giedi City, including\n> full functional diagrams of the subsidiary scrambler-shield\n> generators.\" She extended a stack of thin film sheets densely packed\n> with information. \"Pinquer says they're up to date.\"\n>\n> With boundless enthusiasm and passion, Serena had always demonstrated\n> skill in putting things together. Two years ago, she had led a relief\n> team to Caladan, an Unallied Planet where thousands of refugees from\n> the Synchronized Worlds had fled. On her most recent crusade, a year\n> ago, she had delivered three space transports full of medical supplies\n> to closed-off Tlulax, where the inhabitants were suffering from\n> mysterious diseases. Now that Tlulaxa flesh merchants had provided\n> medical aid and replacement organs from their biological tanks---\n> including saving her beloved Xavier--- she felt that her investment in\n> effort had paid off fully.\n>\n> Now Serena had called in favors, resulting in a mission that bore some\n> similiarities to her earlier successful efforts. She expected another\n> clear success, despite the dangers.\n>\n> With beatific confidence, Serena looked around the table again. She\n> envisioned the mission succeeding. Eleven people willing to challenge\n> a set of conquerors and overcome the odds. \"We have no higher\n> priorities.\"\n>\n> Ort Wibsen had worked between traditional channels to obtain a fast\n> blockade runner. Paterson's engineering crew had equipped the vessel\n> with the best experimental materials she could scavenge from weapons\n> manufactories. Using personal accounts and falsified documentation,\n> Serena had funded whatever the old commander needed. She wanted the\n> best possible chance for her impetuous mission to succeed.\n>\n> Serena said, \"Every person in the League has lost someone to the\n> thinking-machine onslaught, and now we're going to do something about\n> it.\"\n>\n> \"Let's get busy then,\" Pinquer Jibb said. \"Time for payback.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> THAT EVENING, ALONE in the grand dining hall, Serena and Xavier sat\n> across from each another. Servers bustled back and forth in\n> red-and-gold jackets and black trousers.\n>\n> As he sampled golden duckling fillets on his plate, Xavier talked\n> excitedly about Armada mobilization plans and methods of protecting\n> the League Worlds.\n>\n> \"Let's not talk business tonight.\" With a charming smile, Serena rose\n> to her feet and glided around the table, taking a seat next to him,\n> very close. \"I savor each moment with you, Xavier,\" she said, giving\n> nothing away about her plan.\n>\n> He smiled back at her. \"After the poison gas, I can't savor much else.\n> But you, Serena, are better than the finest banquet or the sweetest\n> perfume.\"\n>\n> Stroking his cheek, she said, \"I think we should tell the servants to\n> go to their quarters. My father is in the city and my sister is gone\n> for the evening. Should we waste this time alone?\"\n>\n> He reached out to brush her arm, then drew her close and grinned. \"I'm\n> not hungry anyway.\"\n>\n> \"I am.\" Passionately, she kissed his ear, then his cheek, finally\n> finding his mouth. He ran his fingers through her hair, touching the\n> back of her head and kissing her more deeply.\n>\n> They left the remnants of the fine meal on the table. She took his\n> hand and together they hurried to her chambers. The door was heavy,\n> and locked easily. She already had a fire lit in the fireplace, giving\n> the room an orange, cheery glow. They kissed again and again, trying\n> to unfasten laces and buttons and clips without breaking apart from\n> each other.\n>\n> Serena could barely control her urgency, not just to feel his intimate\n> touch, but to etch every sensation into her mind. He did not know that\n> she intended to slip away afterward, and she needed something to\n> remember about this night, to compensate for the time they would be\n> apart.\n>\n> His fingers were like fire as they traced down her naked back.

His people were good workers,\n> dedicated to him--- but the work itself seemed pointless. When this\n> ornate pedestal was completed and shored up with reinforced arcs, it\n> would become the platform for a colossal statue representing the\n> idealized, long-lost human form of the Titan Ajax.\n>\n> As one of the most successful trustee humans on Earth, Iblis Ginjo\n> took his job very seriously. He scrutinized the throng of slaves\n> scurrying about below. He had convinced them to be enthusiastic,\n> drumming up their attentiveness through well-chosen phrases and\n> rewards . . . though Iblis hated to waste such loyalty and hard work\n> on a brutal bully such as Ajax.\n>\n> Still, every person had his part in the giant machine of civilization.\n> Iblis had to make sure there were no malfunctions, not on his watch.\n>\n> The crew leader was not required to be here; his subordinate trustees\n> could just as easily stand under the hot sun and supervise. But Iblis\n> preferred this to his other duties. Seeing him watch over them, the\n> slaves seemed to add a bit more to the tasks. He took pride in what\n> they could accomplish, if managed well, and they genuinely wanted to\n> please him.\n>\n> Otherwise, he would spend tedious hours involved in the processing of\n> new slaves and assigning them to various work crews. Often the\n> un-tamed ones\n>\n> needed special training, or resisted violently--- problems that\n> hindered the smooth flow of daily work.\n>\n> Erasmus, the strangely independent and eccentric robot, had recently\n> issued an order to inspect any *hrethgir* captives taken from newly\n> conquered Giedi Prime, in particular any human who showed qualities of\n> independence and leadership. Iblis would stay on the alert for a\n> suitable candidate . . . without drawing attention to himself.\n>\n> He didn't care about Omnius's goals for their own sake, but as a crew\n> leader he received certain considerations based on performance. Though\n> such perks made life tolerable, he distributed most of the rewards\n> among his crews.\n>\n> With a broad face and thick hair that fell across his brow, Iblis had\n> a strong, virile appearance. Able to get more work out of the slaves\n> than any other boss, he knew the best tools and incentives, the\n> manipulation of gentle promises rather than harsh threats. Food, rest\n> days, sexual services from the reproductive slaves--- whatever it took\n> to motivate them. He had even been asked to speak some of his thoughts\n> at the school for trustees, but his techniques were not widely adopted\n> among the other privileged humans.\n>\n> Most crew bosses relied on deprivation and torture, but Iblis\n> considered that a waste. He had risen to his position largely through\n> the force of his personality and the allegiance he engendered in his\n> slaves. Even difficult men invariably succumbed to his will. The\n> machines sensed this innate ability, so Omnius gave him the freedom to\n> do his work.\n>\n> At a glance, Iblis counted half a dozen monoliths around the hilltop\n> Forum, each pedestal containing the huge statue of one of the Twenty\n> Titans, beginning with Tlaloc, then Agamemnon, then Juno, Barbarossa,\n> Tamerlane, and Alexander. An immense likeness of Ajax would occupy the\n> one here, not because Ajax was so important, but because he was\n> violently impatient. Dante could wait, and Xerxes.\n>\n> Iblis couldn't remember the rest of the Titans off the top of his\n> head, but he always learned more than he wanted to know as each statue\n> was built. The\n>\n> work would never end. Iblis had been personally involved in every one\n> of the ostentatious sculptures over the past five years, first as a\n> construction slave and later as crew boss.\n>\n> It was late in the summer season, warmer than usual. Heat devils\n> danced off rooftops around the Forum. Directly under him on the dusty\n> ground, his construction crew wore drab browns, grays, and blacks---\n> durable clothing that required only occasional washing or repairs.\n>\n> Below Iblis's platform, a team boss bellowed out orders. Supervisory\n> robots moved about, making no move to assist the straining laborers.\n> Watcheyes floated overhead, recording everything for Omnius. Iblis\n> hardly noticed them anymore. Humans were industrious, ingenious,\n> and--- unlike machines--- flexible, as long as they were given\n> incentives and rewards, encouraged in the proper ways, guided to the\n> best behavior. The thinking machines could not understand the\n> subtleties, but Iblis knew that each minor reward he gave his workers\n> was an investment that paid off tenfold.\n>\n> According to tradition, the slaves often sang work songs and engaged\n> in boisterous team competitions; they were silent now, groaning as\n> they hauled structural blocks into place though in their habitation\n> hives, workers sometimes grumbled about the labor. The cymeks were\n> anxious to see the pedestal completed so they could erect the statue\n> of Ajax, which was being fabricated elsewhere by another crew. Each\n> segment of the project followed a rigid schedule, with no excuses\n> permitted for lateness or shoddy quality.\n>\n> For now, Iblis was glad his people could work in peace, without the\n> intimidating scrutiny of Ajax. Iblis did not know where the Titan\n> might be at the moment, but could only hope he would prey on other\n> hapless individuals today. Iblis had work to do and a schedule to\n> keep.\n>\n> In his opinion, the monoliths were useless--- huge obelisks, pillars,\n> statues, and Grogyptian facades for empty, unnecessary buildings. But\n> it was not his position to question such time-consuming projects.\n> Iblis knew full well that the monuments fulfilled an important\n> psychological need for the usurped\n>\n> tyrants. Besides, such work kept slaves busy and gave them visible\n> results of their labor.\n>\n> Following their humiliating overthrow by Omnius centuries ago, the\n> Titans had constantly scrambled to recover lost status. Iblis thought\n> the cymeks went overboard, building cyclopean statues and pyramids\n> just to make themselves feel more important. They strutted around in\n> showy but old-fashioned machine bodies, bragging about military\n> conquests.\n>\n> Iblis wondered how much of it was really true. After all, how could\n> anyone question those who controlled history? The wild humans in the\n> unruly League worlds probably had a different view of the conquests.\n>\n> He wiped sweat from his brow and smelled the gritty dust that rose\n> from the work below. He looked at the electronic notepad in his hand,\n> checking the progress against the schedule tally. Everything was\n> proceeding well, as expected.\n>\n> With his sharp eyes, he spotted a man leaning against a shaded wall,\n> taking an unauthorized rest. With a smile, Iblis pointed an\n> \"encourager\" pulse weapon at him and skimmed the man's left leg with a\n> beam of energy. The slave slapped the hot spot on his skin and whirled\n> to look up at Iblis.\n>\n> \"Are you trying to make me look bad?\" Iblis yelled. \"What if Ajax came\n> around and saw you falling asleep there? Would he kill you first, or\n> me?\"\n>\n> Abashed, the man shouldered his way into the crowd of sweating\n> laborers, where he resumed his work with renewed vigor.\n>\n> Some work bosses found it necessary to kill slaves as examples to the\n> others, but Iblis had never resorted to that tactic and vowed that he\n> never would. He was certain it would break the inexplicable spell he\n> had over the men. Instead, he only had to show disappointment in them,\n> and they worked harder.\n>\n> Every few days he delivered stirring, impromptu speeches. On such\n> occasions the slaves received water and rest breaks, giving them\n> renewed\n>\n> energy that more than made up for the time spent. The way he strung\n> phrases together often brought cheers and enthusiasm, and only a few\n> questions from bold slaves who wondered why they should be excited\n> about yet another monument. The work leader's talent lay in being\n> utterly *convincing*.\n>\n> Iblis hated the machine overlords, but concealed his feelings so\n> effectively that his superiors actually trusted him. Now, in a\n> fanciful moment, he envisioned destroying the computer evermind and\n> installing himself in its place. Much more than a mere trustee. Think\n> of it--- Iblis Ginjo, ruler of all, knower of all!\n>\n> He caught himself and dispelled the foolish daydream. Reality was a\n> harsh teacher, like the sight of a cymek on a beautiful day. If Iblis\n> didn't complete the obelisk pedestal in time, Ajax would devise an\n> extravagant punishment for them all.\n>\n> The work leader didn't dare fall behind schedule.\n\n*Each of us influences the actions of the people we know.*\n\n--- XAVIER HARKONNEN,\n\ncomment to his men\n\n> **F**or days, Tercero Xavier Harkonnen stayed up late working on\n> defensive plans for the League. Since his sweet night with Serena--- a\n> sparkling promise of their future--- he had devoted himself to the\n> protection of free humanity.\n>\n> On Salusa he flew practice missions, drilled new fighters, increased\n> the number of picket ships on the system's perimeter for a stronger\n> first defense, and extended the scanning network to provide a better\n> early-warning capability from deep space. Engineers and scientists\n> dismantled and studied the warrior-forms abandoned by the cymeks and\n> left behind in the ruins of Zimia, hoping to find flaws or weaknesses.\n> With each breath in his replacement lungs, he felt outrage against the\n> thinking machines.\n>\n> He wanted to spend more time with Serena, dreaming of where they would\n> go after the wedding, but driven by anger and private guilt about\n> Giedi Prime, Xavier buried himself in work. If he had concentrated on\n> the primary mission there, rather than mooning like a lovesick\n> schoolboy, he might have noticed the defensive flaw and helped the\n> Magnus to prepare. Even encouraging the immediate completion of the\n> secondary shield generator would have made all the difference. But it\n> was too late now.\n>\n> Seemingly inconsequential mistakes could lead to huge events. Xavier\n> promised himself that he would never lapse in his duties again, not\n> for any reason. If that meant spending less time with Serena, she\n> would understand.\n>\n> Emergency staff meetings resulted in a revision of the military\n> structure of the Armada, combining the resources and numerous warship\n> designs from all the planetary militias and home guards. The special\n> defensive needs and tactical significance of each League World were\n> discussed in detail.\n>\n> Armada recruitment surged to new levels. Manufactories worked overtime\n> to provide ships and weapons.\n>\n> Xavier hoped it would be enough.\n>\n> In his office on the top floor of the Joint Staff Building, electronic\n> star maps covered the walls. Printed charts and reports cluttered\n> every work surface. Each step of the way, he obtained the approval of\n> the Joint Staff Commander, who in turn reviewed key elements with\n> Viceroy Butler.\n>\n> When he slept at all, Xavier did so in his office or in the\n> underground barracks. For days he did not return home to the Tantor\n> estate, though his mother often sent eager young Vergyl to deliver\n> meals made especially for him.\n>\n> Oddly, he had not heard from Serena, and assumed the Viceroy's\n> daughter was occupied with vital duties of her own. The two young\n> lovers were alike in their ability to see large-scale priorities . . .\n> and in their independence.\n>\n> Determined to revamp League defenses, Xavier kept himself going with\n> stimulant capsules and drinks. He rarely noted what time of day or\n> night it was, heeding only the next meeting on his schedule. Now he\n> blinked through his office window at the quiet streets and the city\n> lights glittering in the darkness. How long had it been night time?\n> The hours merged with each other, carrying him along like a pebble in\n> a landslide.\n>\n> In the final tally, how much could one man actually accomplish? Were\n> some League Worlds already doomed, no matter what he did? Because of\n> the distances between planets and slow space travel, communication was\n> sluggish, and news was often stale by the time it reached Salusa\n> Secundus.\n>\n> His reliance on stimulants made him feel scratchy and ragged. He was\n> awake, but so pummeled by fatigue that he could no longer focus. He\n> heaved a huge sigh, staring blankly. At the side of the office, his\n> adjutant, Cuarto Jaymes Powder, had cleared a spot on a table and\n> rested his head on the polished wood.\n>\n> When the door opened, Cuarto Powder did not stir, or even snore, but\n> continued sleeping like the dead. Xavier was surprised to see Viceroy\n> Butler stride in, also weary to the core. \"We need to implement\n> whatever you've got ready, Xavier. Funding is guaranteed. For the sake\n> of morale, the people must *see* us doing something.\"\n>\n> \"I know, but we need more than one solution, sir. Have Lord Bludd\n> encourage Savant Holtzman to present any preliminary concepts he has\n> under development.\" He rubbed his eyes. \"If nothing else, we need new\n> options for our arsenal.\"\n>\n> \"We already talked about that last night, Xavier--- at great length.\"\n> The Viceroy looked at him strangely. \"Don't you remember? He has\n> several prototype units almost ready.\"\n>\n> \"Yes . . . of course. I was just reminding you.\"\n>\n> Xavier crossed the room and sat at an interactive information screen,\n> a high-security system that flirted with the dangers of a computer.\n> The electronic summary system could organize and provide vital data,\n> but had no self-awareness. Many nobles--- especially Bludd of\n> Poritrin--- resented the use of even such crude computers, but in\n> times such as these, the summary systems were vital.\n>\n> Passing his hand over the screen, Xavier made adjustments in his\n> report to Parliament, including a compendium of planet-specific\n> appendices, then printed the document, copies of which would be sent\n> to each League World. Presently he handed a neat stack to the Viceroy,\n> who perused the recommendations and signed his approval with a\n> flourish. Then Serena's father hurried out of the office, leaving the\n> door open behind him.\n>\n> At the table, Cuarto Powder stirred and sat up, bleary-eyed. Without a\n> word, Xavier settled into the chair at his own desk. Across the room,\n> the summary screen flashed in an aurora of light as technicians filled\n> it with probing signals to make certain the system exhibited no glints\n> of artificial intelligence.\n>\n> As his aide drifted off again, Xavier dozed as well. In his groggy\n> imagination he dreamed that Serena Butler was missing, along with a\n> ship and military team. It seemed surreal to him, but plausible . . .\n> then he realized with a start that he was not asleep at all anymore.\n>\n> Powder stood at his desk with another officer, listening to the bad\n> news. \"She's taken a blockade-runner, sir! Modified it with expensive\n> armor and weaponry. She has a group of commandos with her. An old\n> veteran, Ort Wibsen, agreed to lead them.\"\n>\n> Xavier struggled to throw off the confusion induced by weariness.\n> After rubbing his scratchy eyes he was surprised to see Serena's\n> wide-eyed sister Octa standing behind the men. In a pale hand she held\n> a gleaming black diamond necklace dangling from a coil of gold, which\n> she hurriedly handed to him.\n>\n> \"Serena told me to wait five days, and then give this to you.\" Octa\n> seemed ethereal, delicate; she moved to his side, but would not meet\n> his gaze.\n>\n> Searching for answers, Xavier removed the necklace from the coil. When\n> he touched the black diamonds, the perspiration on his hand activated\n> a tiny projector that showed a small holo image of Serena. He stared\n> at her, feeling astonishment and dread. The visual seemed to look\n> directly at him.\n>\n> \"Xavier, my love, I have gone to Giedi Prime. The League would have\n> argued the issue for months, while the conquered people suffer. I\n> can't permit that.\" Her smile was heartbreaking, but hopeful. \"I have\n> a team of the best engineers, commandos, and infiltration specialists.\n> We have all the equipment and expertise we need to slip in and\n> activate the secondary shield transmitter. We will complete the\n> construction and install the systems\n>\n> --- enabling us to cut off the planet from thinking machine ships,\n> while trapping the ones that are already there on the surface. You\n> must bring in the Armada and recapture this world. We're counting on\n> you. Think of how much we can help humanity!\"\n>\n> Xavier was unable to believe what he was hearing. The image of Serena\n> continued to speak her recorded message. \"I will be waiting there,\n> Xavier. I\n>\n> know you won't let me down.\"\n>\n> Xavier clenched his hands until his knuckles whitened. If anyone could\n> accomplish such a surprising mission, it was Serena Butler. She was\n> impetuous, but at least she was trying to do something. And she knew\n> her decision would force the rest of them to act.\n>\n> Octa began crying softly at his side. Viceroy Butler rushed into the\n> office, appalled at what he had heard.\n>\n> \"That's just like her,\" Xavier said. \"Now we have to rally a\n> response--- there's no choice.\"\n>\n> *Think of war as behavior.*\n\n--- GENERAL AGAMEMNON,\n\n*Memoirs*\n\n> **I**n an arena under the harsh sunlight of Earth's equatorial zone,\n> Agamemnon prepared to battle Omnius's gladiator machine. The evermind\n> treated these mock combats as challenges for the subservient Titans, a\n> way for them to vent their anger and keep them preoccupied. But\n> Agamemnon saw it as an opportunity to strike hard against his real\n> enemy.\n>\n> Two hundred and thirty years ago, human slaves and contractor robots\n> had completed this semicircular, open-roofed coliseum for Omnius's\n> flashy battles. The evermind enjoyed testing the destructive\n> capabilities of different robotic designs. Here, armored vehicles and\n> self-aware artillery systems could clash under controlled\n> circumstances.\n>\n> Long ago, the genius Barbarossa had programmed an appreciation for\n> combat and a thirst for conquest into the artificial intelligence that\n> had evolved into Omnius. Even a thousand years later the computer\n> evermind had never forgotten his taste for victory.\n>\n> Sometimes these staged competitions pitted humans against machines.\n> Randomly selected slaves from work gangs were given clubs, explosives,\n> or cutting beams and thrown into the arena to face combat robots. The\n> irrational violence of desperate humans never ceased to challenge the\n> calculating mind of Omnius. At other times, the omnipresent computer\n> preferred to demonstrate his own superiority against his cymeks.\n>\n> In anticipation of the next gladiatorial challenge, Agamemnon had\n> spent considerable effort in designing his new combat body. Omnius\n> sometimes pitted his sleekest, most sophisticated models against the\n> Titans; on other occasions, he responded with absurdly massive\n> monstrosities that would never have been viable in any real struggle.\n> It was all for show.\n>\n> Months ago, when Barbarossa had achieved a particularly fine victory\n> against Omnius, the cymek had demanded permission to attack the feral\n> humans as a reward. While the strike on Salusa Secundus had not gone\n> well, the Titans' second effort had conquered Giedi Prime. Barbarossa\n> was even now overseeing dozens of neo-cymeks in the subjugation of the\n> people there, a Titan once more in charge of a world. At last, it was\n> a step in the right direction . . .\n>\n> If he succeeded in winning in the arena today, Agamemnon had plans of\n> his own.\n>\n> With sirens blaring to announce the new event, Agamemnon rolled\n> forward on resilient walker pads and passed between the Corinthian\n> columns of Challenger's Gate. He could feel the thrumming strength of\n> his stepped-up mobility systems, the pulse of increased power surging\n> through his neurelectric pathways.\n>\n> Inside this gladiator-form, his low-slung body core consisted of a\n> pair of reinforced spheres--- one surrounded by opaque armor, the\n> other made of transparent alloyglas. Within the clear globe hung the\n> grayish white hemispheres of his human brain, drifting in a pale-blue\n> electrafluid and connected to thoughtrodes. Faint photon discharges\n> crackled along the cerebral lobes as the cymek body moved forward,\n> ready to fight.\n>\n> Around the double-sphere core, bulky drive motors hummed inside\n> protective cowlings. Engines worked the smooth hydraulics of four\n> grappling legs. Each articulated limb ended with a shifting mass of\n> adaptable metal polymer that could shape itself into a variety of\n> hardened weapons.\n>\n> Agamemnon had constructed this ferocious gladiator-form under the\n> buzzing gaze of watcheyes that monitored his every move. Omnius\n> supposedly filed all such information in a segregated portion of his\n> evermind, so as not to gain an unfair combat advantage. Or so Omnius\n> claimed.\n>\n> While Agamemnon waited, poised for battle, his opponent strode\n> forward, controlled directly by the evermind. Omnius had selected a\n> walking suit of exaggerated medieval armor: two massive legs with feet\n> like the foundations of a building and arms that ended in gauntleted\n> fists as large as the body core itself. The proportions were grossly\n> exaggerated, like a child's nightmare of a bully. Spikes extruded from\n> the massive knuckles on Omnius's goliath robot, and apocalyptic\n> discharges arced from point to point on the thorny fist.\n>\n> Agamemnon pushed forward on armored walker pads while raising his\n> crablike forelimbs, the adaptable-polymer ends of each morphing into\n> claws. Even if he won the contest today, the evermind would suffer\n> nothing, would not even have the grace to be humiliated in defeat.\n>\n> On the other hand, Omnius could accidentally destroy the Titan's brain\n> canister. Unforseen things happened in battle situations, and maybe\n> Omnius\n>\n> --- despite his programming that prevented him from intentionally\n> killing a Titan--- was counting on that. For Agamemnon, this fight was\n> for real.\n>\n> A few designated robotic observers watched from the stands through\n> enhanced optic threads, but they remained silent. Agamemnon did not\n> require applause anyway. The other polished stone seats in the\n> coliseum remained empty, reflecting daylight from the open sky. The\n> large stadium, like an echoing tomb, had all the room necessary for\n> two gigantic foes to clash.\n>\n> No announcement preceded the fight, no information piped over\n> loudspeakers. Agamemnon launched his attack first.\n>\n> The Titan raised his whiplike grappling arms, hardened them with a\n> shifting diamond film, and drove forward on heavy walker pads. With\n> surprising agility, Omnius's goliath robot lifted an enormous leg and\n> sidestepped the attack.\n>\n> Agamemnon lunged with another of his forelimbs, this one capped with a\n> spherical wrecking ball that fired disruptive, paralyzing energy. The\n> pulse thrummed through vulnerable systems, and Omnius's warrior\n> shuddered.\n>\n> Suddenly the goliath swiveled, raising a gauntleted fist to smash the\n> cymek's segmented arm. Even the diamond film could not endure the\n> blow, which bent Agamemnon's forelimb until it ripped from the\n> flexible socket. The cymek dismissed the damage and reversed his\n> walker pads, ejecting the unsalvageable limb. He swung up a cutting\n> arm that metamorphosed into a flurry of shimmering diamond blades.\n>\n> Agamemnon sawed through his opponent's armored torso, severing a set\n> of neurelectric control threads. Greenish fluid sprayed out from\n> chopped lubricant channels. The combat goliath swung his other spiked\n> fist, but Agamemnon danced his walker pads sideways and shifted his\n> vulnerable body core, keeping the brain canister safe.\n>\n> When his swing missed completely, the heavy blow overbalanced the\n> gladiator robot. Agamemnon brought up two slicing arms, hacking at the\n> goliath's arm joints with white-hot cutting irons. He found vulnerable\n> spots with surprising ease, and the goliath's right arm dangled\n> useless, a tangle of neurelectric fibers and conductive fluids.\n>\n> To assess the damage, Omnius dragged his unwieldy fighter two\n> thundering steps backward. Agamemnon pressed his advantage, closing to\n> grappling distance. Then he unleashed his first major surprise.\n>\n> From a concealed compartment within the old-fashioned engine housing,\n> a trapdoor irised open, and eight reinforced conductor-fiber cables\n> sprang out, each tipped with a magnetic connector claw. The cables\n> flew like a nest of startled vipers and slammed into the reeling\n> goliath. As soon as the tips struck home, Agamemnon released a huge\n> energy discharge. Lightning flared up and down the massive body of\n> Omnius's fighter.\n>\n> The cymek general expected this insidious blow to knock the combat\n> robot completely offline, but Omnius must have shielded his fighting\n> unit well. Agamemnon sent another paralytic pulse like a scorpion's\n> sting, but still the Omnius gladiator did not fall. Instead, as if in\n> anger, the machine swung its mammoth gauntlet with the force of a\n> colliding train, putting all of his energy and momentum behind a\n> single blow.\n>\n> The spiked fist struck true, slamming into the transparent\n> preservation sphere that held the disembodied brain. A major jamming\n> surge pulsed out of the knuckle spikes, and a shaped fracture wave\n> shattered the curved glass walls of the protected brain canister.\n> Through the breached container walls, electrafluid spilled like blue\n> gushing blood. Thoughtrodes tore, and the brain fell from its\n> suspender wires, dangling naked in the open, hot air.\n>\n> It might have been the death of Agamemnon.\n>\n> But the cymek general had devised his own trick. The brain inside the\n> transparent container was only a decoy, a synthetic reproduction of\n> his cerebral contours. Agamemnon's actual brain was inside the opaque\n> metal-walled sphere, from which he controlled the gladiator-form. Safe\n> and intact.\n>\n> He was, however, astonished and infuriated. Omnius had proven his\n> willingness to inflict severe damage on the most powerful and talented\n> Titan of all. Omnius's strong urge to avoid losing seemed capable of\n> overriding his programming restrictions. Or had the evermind known\n> about the ruse all along? Agamemnon launched his vindictive response.\n>\n> Even as he spun backward on his walker pads, roaring away as fast as\n> possible, he ejected the now-cracked sphere that contained the false\n> brain. He launched it into the body core of the goliath robot.\n>\n> In his specially constructed body, Agamemnon then ducked down, raising\n> his armored limbs and lowering his shielded brain canister between the\n> rows of thick walker pads to protect himself, like a turtle\n> withdrawing into a shell.\n>\n> The brain sphere struck the damaged gladiator and detonated. The\n> simulated brain had been sculpted from high-energy solid foam. Flames\n> roared past Agamemnon, charring the ground. The resulting explosion\n> bowled over the goliath robot, decapitating it, ripping open its\n> torso. The shockwave was sufficient to knock down part of the nearest\n> coliseum wall.\n>\n> Agamemnon had survived--- and the Omnius gladiator had fallen.\n>\n> \"Excellent, General!\" The computer voice echoed from loudspeakers in\n> the intact portion of the arena, sounding genuinely pleased. \"A most\n> refreshing and enjoyable maneuver.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon still wondered if Omnius had been aware that the visible\n> brain was false. Or perhaps the evermind had found a way to circumvent\n> the protective restrictions Barbarossa had installed so many years\n> ago. Now he would never be sure if the evermind was indeed willing to\n> let him die in combat. Maybe Omnius had to keep the ambitious Titans\n> from feeling too triumphant or overvalued, especially Agamemnon.\n>\n> Only Omnius knew for certain, one way or the other.\n>\n> Amid the smoke and flames rising from the ruin of the goliath machine,\n> Agamemnon raised his gladiator-form, the uncontested victor. \"I have\n> defeated you, Omnius. I wish to claim my reward.\"\n>\n> \"Naturally, General,\" he answered, sounding good-natured. \"You need\n> not even speak your wish. Yes, I shall allow you and your cymeks to\n> lead further strikes against the *hrethgir*. Go forth and enjoy\n> yourselves.\"\n>\n> *Survivors learn to adapt.*\n\n--- ZUFA CENVA,\n\nlecture to Sorceresses\n\n> **I**n the pristine, contoured cabin of the *Dream Voyager*, Vorian\n> Atreides and Seurat cruised between star systems again, picking up and\n> delivering Omnius updates to maintain congruence in the distributed\n> evermind across all the Synchronized Worlds.

While Seurat was talented at intricate strategy and could\n> calculate many moves ahead, Vor often pulled off baffling innovative\n> twists to win. Seurat had trouble comprehending the human's erratic\n> behavior. \"I can follow the consequences in a logical progression from\n> an individual event, but I cannot understand how you manage to turn\n> impulsive and illogical behavior into an effective strategy. There is\n> no causal connection.\"\n>\n> Vor smiled at him. \"I'd hate to see you calculate an 'irrational'\n> response, old Metalmind. Leave it to the experts, like me.\"\n>\n> The son of Agamemnon was also quite proficient at military tactics and\n> strategies, a skill he had developed by studying the great battles of\n> ancient human history, as summarized in his father's extensive\n> memoirs. The cymek general made no secret that he hoped his son would\n> become an accomplished military genius one day.\n>\n> Whenever Seurat fell behind in a particular contest, he continued his\n> irritating habit of distracting Vor with jokes, trivia, or\n> anecdotes--- tailoring them to interest the brash young man. During\n> all the time the machine\n>\n> captain had known his human copilot, Seurat had accumulated and\n> assessed information, preparing it for future use. The robot captain\n> had become adept at raising topics that engrossed Vor and sent his\n> thoughts spinning.\n>\n> Seurat chattered incessantly about the legendary life of Agamemnon,\n> adding details Vor had never read in the memoirs: great battles the\n> Titans had won, planets they had added to the Synchronized Worlds, and\n> the warrior-forms Agamemnon had designed for private gladiatorial\n> contests. Once, the robot captain concocted an absurd tale about how\n> the great general had literally lost his mind. The cymek's protected\n> brain canister had accidentally detached from its walker-form and gone\n> tumbling down a hill, while the mechanical body, on automatic\n> programming, had to scamper about and find it.\n>\n> However, Vorian had recently uncovered information more unsettling\n> than anything the robot could ever reveal. Between games and\n> challenges, he often skimmed the open databases, reading his favorite\n> parts of his father's memoirs, trying to make sense of the reams of\n> Omnius's minutiae. On one of those excursions Vor discovered that over\n> the years, Agamemnon had sired twelve other sons. Vorian had never\n> assumed he was the only one--- but a dozen unknown brothers! The great\n> Titan general would naturally have wanted to create descendants worthy\n> of his legacy.\n>\n> Worse, he discovered that each of those dozen sons had proved to be a\n> failure. Agamemnon did not suffer disappointments gladly, and had\n> killed his unacceptable offspring, though they had been privileged\n> trustees just like Vor. The last had been executed nearly a century\n> ago. Now Vor was his father's best hope, but not necessarily the only\n> choice. Agamemnon must still have more sperm in storage . . . and thus\n> Vor was just as expendable as the others.\n>\n> After learning that, Vor became immune to Seurat's attempts at\n> distraction.\n>\n> Now Vor sat at the table, staring at a projected game board and\n> considering his next move. He knew Seurat could not determine what was\n> going on inside the unpredictable human mind. Even with all his\n> independent\n>\n> sophistication, the robot accumulated only external data and did not\n> recognize subtleties.\n>\n> The trustee smiled, just a little, which Seurat did not fail to\n> notice. \"You are playing a little trick on me? Exercising some secret\n> human power?\"\n>\n> Vor continued to smile and stare at the board. It was a multigame\n> competition, revolving inside a three-dimensional screen embedded in\n> the tabletop. Each player attempted to choose a contest or situation\n> that benefited him from a wide selection of games, and then make a\n> move. The score was tied, and the next point would win the contest.\n>\n> The various games came up at random, and each time Vor had only a few\n> seconds to make his move. He watched the shifting graphics as they\n> locked into place momentarily before moving on. The ancient Terran\n> game of Go appeared on the palette of selections; nothing there to\n> benefit him. More options flowed by. A machine-biased game appeared\n> next, one that required more memory than Vor had. He let it pass. Two\n> other games appeared that he didn't like, followed by a poker hand.\n>\n> Relying on luck and bluster, Vor faced off against the robot captain,\n> who could not understand the strategy of bluffing or the \"skill\" of\n> random odds. Vor's expression was unreadable, and he laughed at the\n> confusion he saw on Seurat's mirrored face.\n>\n> \"You lost,\" Vor said. \"And you lost, badly.\" He crossed his arms over\n> his chest, feeling smug after the robot finally folded his hand. \"It's\n> not just the score, but the way you tried to win.\"\n>\n> Seurat responded that he did not wish to play more games, and Vor\n> laughed at him. \"You're sulking, old Metalmind!\"\n>\n> \"I am reassessing my tactics.\"\n>\n> Vor reached across the table and pounded his opponent's slick\n> shoulder, as if to comfort him. \"Why don't you stay here and practice,\n> while I run the ship?

The old man cursed his health, cursed the\n> implanted medical injector in his chest.\n>\n> \"Commander, don't jeopardize this mission because of your stubborn\n> pride,\" Serena scolded.\n>\n> The ship pitched to one side and creaked. Behind a bulkhead something\n> fizzed. \"Damn water turbulence!\" Red-faced, Wibsen kept the blockade\n> runner under control, then turned back to glare at Serena. \"Right now\n> I'm just the chauffeur. I can relax as soon as I drop you off.\"\n>\n> The vessel cruised beneath the surface for an hour, deep enough to\n> avoid any floating chunks of ice from the polar regions, and finally\n> guided them toward a sheltered bay. On the cockpit screens, the\n> approaching island looked stark and rocky, all black cliffs and ice.\n> \"Doesn't look like much of a resort to me,\" Wibsen said.\n>\n> Brigit Paterson said, \"Magnus Sumi didn't choose the site for its\n> beauty. From here, a polar projection is simple and efficient.\n> Coverage from these transmitters is good for all the inhabited land\n> masses.\"\n>\n> Wibsen brought the blockade runner to the surface. \"I still think it's\n> an ugly place.\" As he guided them into the deep harbor embraced by a\n> crescent of cliffs, he began to cough again, louder and worse than\n> before. \"Damned ridiculous timing.\" He looked more annoyed than\n> distressed. \"We're on auto-guide, still on course.

Brigit Paterson nodded, all business. \"Even\n> so, we've got our work cut out for us.\"\n>\n> *In times of war, every person claims to contribute to the effort.\n> Some give lip service, some provide funds, but few are willing to\n> sacrifice everything.

They were not the *only*\n> weapon against the terrible cymeks, not the most powerful blow the\n> League could strike. But they were critical to the war effort.\n>\n> Zufa stood in the fleshy underbrush with her trainees and looked at\n> them with compassion and love. No one in all the League Worlds was\n> more confident of success or devoted to victory. Her heart seemed\n> ready to burst as she saw them focusing every scrap of energy toward\n> the ultimate goal. If only everyone else could be as intent, the\n> thinking machines would be defeated in short order.\n>\n> As she had done for months now, Zufa led her elite group into the\n> jungle where they could practice their skills and summon the power\n> within their spirits. Each of these women was the equivalent of a\n> psychic warhead. Zufa, blessed from birth with more talents than any\n> of them, had been sharing her methods, pushing the others to their\n> limits. She had patiently taught them how to unleash incredible\n> telepathic abilities . . .and how to exercise control. The women had\n> performed admirably, beyond Zufa's most optimistic forecasts.\n>\n> But they must make their effort stand for something.\n>\n> Now she sat on a fallen silvery-barked log that was overgrown with a\n> thick cushion of shelf fungus. The canopy was dense with shadows that\n> interlocked high overhead. Dark purple foliage filtered the caustic\n> rainwater\n>\n> so that droplets trickling like tears to the mulchy ground were fresh\n> and drinkable. Large insects and spiny rodents tore through the soil\n> layers, oblivious to the testing the Sorceresses were about to begin.\n>\n> \"Concentrate. Relax . . . but be prepared to *focus* with all your\n> might, when I command you to do so.\" Zufa looked at the women, all of\n> them tall and pale, with translucent skin and shining white hair. They\n> looked like guardian angels, luminous beings sent to protect humanity\n> against the thinking machines. Could there be any other reason why God\n> had granted them such mental powers?\n>\n> Her gaze moved from face to determined face: Silin, the bold,\n> impulsive one; creative Camio, who improvised forms of attack; Tirbes,\n> still discovering her potential; Rucia, who always chose integrity;\n> Heoma, with the most raw power . . . and nine others. If Zufa were to\n> ask for a volunteer, she knew all of her chosen Sorceresses would\n> demand the honor.\n>\n> It was her task to select who would be the first martyr among them.\n> Xavier Harkonnen was already anxious to depart for Giedi Prime.\n>\n> She loved her trainees as if they were her children . . . and in a\n> very real sense, they were, for they were following her methods,\n> maximizing their potential. These young women were so different from\n> her own Norma. . . .\n>\n> Facing the chief Sorceress, the fourteen stood together, apparently\n> content and calm, but coiled within. Their eyes fell half closed.\n> Their nostrils flared as they breathed, counting heartbeats and using\n> innate biofeedback skills to alter bodily functions.\n>\n> \"Begin to build the power in your mind. Feel it like the static\n> electricity before a lightning storm.\" She saw their expressions\n> flicker as their thoughts stirred.\n>\n> \"Now increase the power one bit at a time. Envision it in your brain,\n> but do not lose control. One step, then another. Feel the energy\n> amplifying--- but do not release it. You must maintain your hold.\"\n>\n> Around her in the dimness of the fungoid jungle, Zufa felt the energy\n> crackling, building. She smiled.\n>\n> Zufa sat back on her log, feeling weak but not daring to show it. Her\n> recent difficult miscarriage, expelling Aurelius Venport's monstrous\n> child, had left her drained. But there was so much work to do, so much\n> she could not delay or delegate. The League Worlds were depending upon\n> her, especially now.\n>\n> Everyone had high expectations of the most powerful Sorceress, but\n> Zufa Cenva placed an even greater burden upon herself. At every turn,\n> her plans and dreams had been hamstrung when people refused to expend\n> the effort or take the necessary risks. These eager, talented trainees\n> seemed different, though, and she assured herself that they would\n> perform up to her standards. Too often when she measured other people,\n> she found them wanting.\n>\n> \"Another notch,\" she said. \"Intensify your power. See how far it can\n> go, but always be careful. An error at this point would wipe us all\n> out--- and the human race cannot afford to lose us.\"\n>\n> Psychic energy pulsed higher. The Sorceresses'pale hair began to drift\n> upward as if gravity had failed. \"Good. Good. Keep it going.\" Their\n> success delighted her.\n>\n> Zufa had never been interested in self-aggrandizement. She was a stern\n> and difficult taskmistress, with little patience or sympathy for the\n> failings of others. The chief Sorceress did not need wealth and profit\n> like Aurelius Venport, or accolades like Tio Holtzman, or even a show\n> of attention like Norma seemed to desire by convincing the Savant to\n> take her as his apprentice. If Zufa Cenva was impatient, she had a\n> right to be. This was a time of great crisis.\n>\n> The underbrush stirred as native insects and rodents scampered away\n> from the pounding psychic waves that built to a crescendo. Trees\n> rustled, leaves and twigs fluttering as if trying to break away from\n> their parent stalks and flee the jungle. Zufa narrowed her eyes and\n> studied her students.\n>\n> Now they were reaching the most dangerous part. The mental energy had\n> increased until their bodies began to shimmer and glow. Zufa had to\n> use her own skills to erect a protective barrier against the combined\n> psychic pressure on her mind. One slip and all would be lost.\n>\n> But she knew these dedicated apprentices would never make such a\n> mistake. They understood the stakes and the consequences. Zufa's heart\n> ached as she gazed upon them.\n>\n> One trainee, Heoma, displayed more strength than her companions. She\n> had built her power to a higher level while still maintaining control.\n> The destructive force could easily have become a wildfire in her brain\n> cells, but Heoma held onto it, staring with unseeing eyes as her hair\n> whipped like a storm.\n>\n> Suddenly, out of dense branches high above, a thick-bodied slarpon\n> dropped, a scaly creature with needle teeth and thick body armor. It\n> tumbled among the young women with a crash, disturbed from its\n> predatory perch and maddened by the backwash of mental energy. All\n> muscle and cartilage, it thrashed, snapping with powerful jaws and\n> scrabbling with thick talons.\n>\n> Startled, Tirbes twitched--- and Zufa felt an uncontrolled surge of\n> power spouting like a released jet of fire. \"No!\" she cried and\n> reached out, summoning her own powers to blanket the student's slip.\n> \"Control!\"\n>\n> Heoma, with perfect calm, pointed toward the slarpon as if she were\n> erasing a smudge on a magnetic board. She drew a line of psychic\n> destruction across the scaly predator. The slarpon burst into\n> white-hot flames, thrashing as its bones turned to charcoal, its skin\n> crackling and tearing until it flaked off in puffs of ash. Flames\n> smoldered out of its now-empty eye sockets.\n>\n> Heoma's companions struggled to clamp down and exert their mental\n> forces. But they had been distracted at a critical moment and were\n> losing their slippery grips on their telepathic battering rams.\n> Steadfastly, Heoma and Zufa maintained a superhuman calmness in their\n> midst, a stark contrast to their frenzied efforts. The combined\n> psychic force rippled and undulated.\n>\n> \"Back down,\" Zufa said, her lips trembling. \"Ease the power away. Draw\n> it into yourself. You must retain it and reel it back into your minds.\n> It is a battery, and you must maintain its charge.\"\n>\n> She breathed deeply, saw that all of her psychic warriors were doing\n> the same. One by one they inhaled, and gradually the tingle in the air\n> dissipated as they began to dampen their constant efforts.\n>\n> \"Enough for now. This is the best you've ever done.\" Zufa opened her\n> eyes and saw her students all staring back at her, Tirbes pale and\n> frightened, the others amazed at how close they had come to\n> self-annihilation. Heoma, an island apart, looked entirely unrattled.\n>\n> In a broad circle around them, the soft fungal underbrush was curled\n> and singed. Zufa studied the blackened foliage, fallen twigs, and\n> shriveled lichens. Another instant, a hair's breadth less control, and\n> everyone would have been vaporized in a ball of telepathic flames.\n>\n> But they had survived. The test had succeeded.\n>\n> After the tension finally evaporated, Zufa allowed herself a smile. \"I\n> am proud of all of you,\" she said, and meant it. \"You . . . my weapons\n> . . . will be ready as soon as the Armada arrives.\"\n>\n> *Mathematical answers are not always expressed numerically. How does\n> one calculate the worth of humanity, or of a single human life?*\n>\n> --- COGITOR KWYNA,\n\nCity of Introspection archives\n\n> **A**t Tio Holtzman's extravagant house, high on a bluff, Norma Cenva\n> spent three exhilarating days settling into her expansive laboratory\n> space. She had so much to do, so much to learn. Best of all, the\n> Savant was eager to listen to her ideas. She couldn't have asked for\n> more.\n>\n> Quiet Poritrin seemed so different from the dense, dangerous jungles\n> and lava-rock canyons of Rossak. She was anxious to explore the\n> streets and canals of Starda, which she could see from her high\n> windows.\n>\n> Tentatively, she asked Holtzman for permission to go down to the\n> river, where she had seen many people performing some kind of work.\n> She felt guilty for even asking, rather than working tirelessly on a\n> means to fight the thinking machines. \"My mind is a little tired,\n> Savant, and I am curious.\"\n>\n> Instead of looking at her skeptically, the scientist wholeheartedly\n> endorsed the idea, as if pleased to have an excuse to accompany her.\n> \"I remind you that we are paid to *think*, Norma. We can do that\n> anywhere.\" He shoved aside a sheet of doodles and sketches. \"Perhaps a\n> bit of sightseeing will inspire you to a work of genius. One can never\n> know when inspiration might strike, or where.\"\n>\n> He led her down a steep stairway that clung to a cliff over the Isana.\n> As she stood beside the taller man, Norma inhaled deeply of the\n> river's smell, sour and peaty from silt and vegetation dragged down\n> from the highlands. For the first time in her life, she felt giddy\n> with her own possibilities; the Savant was genuinely interested in her\n> imagination, her mind, and he listened to her suggestions, unlike the\n> constant scorn she had received from her mother.\n>\n> Norma raised an idea that had occurred to her that morning. \"Savant\n> Holtzman, I have studied your scrambler shields. I believe I\n> understand how they function, and I've been wondering if it might be\n> possible to . . . extend them somehow.\"\n>\n> The scientist showed guarded interest, as if afraid she might\n> criticize his invention. \"Extend them? They already stretch across\n> planetary atmospheres.\"\n>\n> \"I mean a different application entirely. Your scramblers are purely a\n> defensive concept. What if we used the same principles in an\n> *offensive* weapon?\" She watched his expression, detected puzzlement\n> but a willingness to listen.\n>\n> \"A weapon? How do you propose to accomplish that?\"\n>\n> Norma answered in a rush. \"What if we could make a . . . projector?\n> Transmit the field into a thinking machine stronghold, disrupt their\n> gelcircuitry brains. Almost like the electromagnetic pulse from an\n> atomic air burst.\"\n>\n> Holtzman's face lit with comprehension. \"Ah, now I see! Its range\n> would be quite limited, and power requirements off the scale. But\n> perhaps . . . it just might work. Enough to knock out the thinking\n> machines within a substantial radius.\" He tapped his chin, excited by\n> the idea. \"A projector--- good, good!\"\n>\n> They walked along the bank until they reached the foul-smelling\n> expanse of mudflats dotted with sloppy pools. Crews of ragged,\n> half-clothed slaves sloshed out onto the mudflats, some barefoot, some\n> wearing boots that extended to their upper thighs. At regular\n> intervals across the featureless field, flat pallets on pontoons held\n> metal barrels. Laborers marched back and forth to the barrels, where\n> they scooped dripping handfuls of the contents and went to plunge\n> their fingers into lines marked in the soft mud.\n>\n> \"What are they doing?\" Norma asked. It looked as if they were\n> embroidering the mudflats with their work.\n>\n> Holtzman squinted as if he had never considered the details. \"Ah! They\n> are planting clam seedlings, tiny shellfish that we raise from eggs\n> filtered out of the river water. Every spring, slaves plant hundreds\n> of thousands of them, maybe millions. I'm not certain.\" He shrugged.\n> \"The waters will rise again, cover the clam plantings, and then\n> recede. Every autumn, harvesting crews dig up the shellfish: clams as\n> big as your hand.\" He held up his right palm. \"Delicious, especially\n> when fried with butter and mushrooms.\"\n>\n> She frowned to watch the backbreaking labor, the sheer number of\n> people wading in the mud. The concept of captive workers remained\n> strange and unpleasant to her, even Holtzman's teams of solvers.\n>\n> The scientist didn't venture too close to the smell and the slaves,\n> despite Norma's obvious curiosity. \"It's wise to maintain our\n> distance.\"\n>\n> \"Savant, doesn't it strike you as somewhat . . . hypocritical that we\n> fight to keep humans free from the domination of machines, while at\n> the same time some of our own League Worlds use slaves?\"\n>\n> He seemed perplexed. \"But how else would Poritrin get any work done,\n> since we have no sophisticated machines?\" When he finally noticed\n> Norma's troubled look, it took him a moment to realize what bothered\n> her. \"Ah, I've forgotten that Rossak keeps no slaves! Isn't that\n> correct?\"\n>\n> She didn't want to sound critical of her host's way of life. \"We have\n> no need, Savant. Rossak's population is small, with plenty of\n> volunteers to scavenge in the jungles.\"\n>\n> \"I see. Well, Poritrin's economy is based on having hands and muscles\n> for constant labor. Long ago, our leaders signed an edict banning\n> machinery that involves any form of computerization, perhaps a little\n> more extreme than on some other League Worlds. We had no choice but to\n> turn to human labor, a manual workforce.\" Smiling broadly, he gestured\n> toward the mudflat crews. \"It's really not so bad, Norma. We feed and\n> clothe them. Bear in mind, these workers were taken from primitive\n> worlds where they lived squalid lives, dying of diseases and\n> malnourishment. This is paradise for them.\"\n>\n> \"They're all from the Unallied Planets?\"\n>\n> \"Leftovers from colonies of religious fanatics that fled the Old\n> Empire. All Buddislamics. They've fallen to distressing levels of\n> barbarism, barely civilized, living like animals. At least most of our\n> slaves receive a rudimentary education, especially the ones who work\n> for me.\"\n>\n> Norma shaded her eyes from the reflected sunlight and stared\n> skeptically at the bent-backed forms out on the mudflats. Would the\n> slaves agree with the scientist's blithe assessment?\n>\n> Holtzman's face hardened. \"Besides, these cowards owe a debt to\n> humanity, for not fighting the thinking machines as we did. Is it too\n> much to ask their descendants to help feed the survivors and veterans\n> who kept--- and still keep--- the machines at bay?

Boats and barges on the Isana looked like waterlogged\n> fire-flies. In the gathering darkness, flaming rafts drifted out from\n> the slave sector, mobile bonfires that floated into the marshes. Each\n> fire rose and peaked, then diminished as the burning rafts sputtered\n> and sank.\n>\n> Humming to himself, Holtzman came to offer her a cup of seasoned tea,\n> and Norma asked him about the boats. Squinting out at the drifting\n> bonfires, he was slow to realize what the slaves were doing. \"Ah, must\n> be cremation rafts. The Isana takes the bodies away from the city, and\n> the ashes are carried out to sea. Basically efficient.\"\n>\n> \"But why are there so many of them?\" Norma pointed at the dozens of\n> flickering lights. \"Do slaves die that often, each day?\"\n>\n> Holtzman frowned. \"I heard something about a plague traveling through\n> the worker population. Most unfortunate, requiring a lot of effort to\n> replace them.\" He reassured her quickly, his eyes brightening.\n> \"Nothing you need worry about, though. Truly. We have plenty of good\n> medicines shipped here, enough to tend all the free citizens in Starda\n> if we should happen to fall ill, too.\"\n>\n> \"But what about all the slaves who are dying?\"\n>\n> His reply was not on point. \"Lord Bludd has requested replacements for\n> them. There's a standing order for healthy candidates these days. The\n> Tlulaxa flesh merchants are happy to harvest more men and women from\n> the outlying worlds. Life on Poritrin goes on.\" He reached down to pat\n> Norma's shoulder as if she were a child needing reassurance.\n>\n> From the balcony, she tried to count the floating fires, but soon gave\n> up the effort. Her tea tasted cold and bitter.\n>\n> Behind her, Holtzman continued happily, \"I very much like your idea of\n> using my scrambler-shield concept as a weapon. I am already thinking\n> of how to design a field-portable projector that could be deployed on\n> the ground.\"\n>\n> \"I understand,\" she said, her voice hesitant. \"I will work harder to\n> suggest new ideas.\"\n>\n> Even after he left, Norma could not tear her eyes from the funeral\n> barges blazing across the river, the floating cremation fires. She had\n> seen how the slaves labored in the mudflats planting clam seedlings\n> and in laboratory rooms calculating hundreds of equations. Now they\n> were dying in droves from a deadly fever . . . but were easily\n> replaced.\n>\n> The League of Nobles desperately sought to keep from being enslaved by\n> the thinking machines. Norma wondered about the hypocrisy here.\n\n*All men are* not*created equal, and that is the root of social unrest.*\n\n--- TLALOC,\n\n*A Time for Titans*\n\n> **T**he Tlulaxa slaving crew came down to Harmonthep like a weary\n> convoy instead of a squadron of military raiders.\n>\n> Tuk Keedair rode in the lead ship, but he left the piloting and\n> shooting to the newcomer Ryx Hannem. Not yet jaded to the\n> slave-acquisition business, young Hannem would be eager to please\n> Keedair, and the veteran flesh merchant wanted to see what this novice\n> was made of.\n>\n> Keedair had a flattened nose that had been broken twice in his youth;\n> he liked the way it had healed, imparting rugged character to his\n> wolfish face. In his right ear he wore a triangular gold earring\n> etched with a hieroglyphic mark that he refused to translate for\n> anyone. A thick black braid, tarnished with strands of gray, hung\n> between his shoulders at the left side of his face\n>\n> --- a mark of pride, since commercial tradition required a flesh\n> merchant to slice off the braid after any unprofitable year. And\n> Keedair's had grown long.\n>\n> \"Do we have coordinates yet?\" Hannem asked, looking nervously at his\n> control panel, then out the cockpit wind-shield. \"Where should we\n> start, sir?\"\n>\n> \"Harmonthep's an Unallied Planet, boy, and the Buddislamics don't\n> publish maps. We just look for a village and then harvest the people.\n> Nobody's keeping a census.\"\n>\n> Hannem peered through the viewer, searching for villages. The\n> clustered Tlulaxa ships cruised over a waterlogged green continent. No\n> mountains or hills rose above the soggy landscape of lakes, marshes,\n> and waterways. Harmonthep seemed to have an aversion to pushing its\n> land masses much above sea level. Even the oceans were shallow.\n>\n> After a few more runs, Keedair might take a long furlough back on\n> Tlulax, the closed-off world of his people. It was a nice place to\n> relax, though he was sure he'd get restless again before long. As a\n> \"procurer of human resources,\" Keedair had no regular home.\n>\n> The Tlulaxa biological industry had a constant demand for fresh\n> material, generated from new subjects, untapped genetic lines. By\n> imposing a high degree of secrecy on their work, the Tlulaxa had\n> managed to fool their innocent League customers. When the price was\n> right and the need great, the nobles easily swallowed stories of\n> sophisticated bio-tanks that could grow viable replacement organs. The\n> dedicated researchers eventually hoped to modify their clone-growth\n> tanks to produce such products, but the necessary technology had not\n> yet been attained.\n>\n> It was so much easier to just grab swarms of forgotten humans who\n> lived on outlying worlds. The kidnappings would never be noticed, and\n> the captives would all be carefully catalogued according to their\n> genetics.\n>\n> For the time being, though, the sudden shortage of viable slaves on\n> Poritrin had changed Keedair's business focus. As long as the plague\n> continued, it would be more profitable just to provide living\n> captives, warm bodies that needed no further processing. . . .\n>\n> As the slavers approached the tangled swamps, Keedair tapped the\n> scanned topographic map on his console screen. \"Fly low over that\n> broad stream and follow it. In my experience, you're likely to find\n> villages at a confluence of waterways.\"\n>\n> As the craft swooped down, he spotted large dark shapes moving in the\n> waters, serpentine creatures curling through bamboolike reeds. Huge\n> orange flowers bloomed on the tops of the stalks, opening and closing\n> like fleshy mouths. Keedair was glad he didn't have to stay on this\n> ugly world for long.\n>\n> \"I see something, sir!\" Hannem overlaid a magnified display on the\n> windscreen, pointing out a cluster of huts standing on poles within\n> the marshes.\n>\n> \"Good enough, boy.\" Keedair contacted the slaver ships in their wake.\n> \"Just like plucking fruit from a nobleman's garden.\"\n>\n> The marsh village did not look substantial. The round huts were made\n> of reeds and mud, fused with some sort of plastic cement. A few\n> antennas, mirrors, and wind collectors hung between them, although the\n> Buddislamics used little sophisticated technology. He doubted the\n> harvest from this single village would fill the holds, but he was\n> always optimistic. Business had been good lately.\n>\n> Three attack ships flanked Keedair's lead craft, while the Tlulaxa\n> human-cargo vessels were in the rear. Ryx Hannem looked uneasy as the\n> slavers approached the village. \"Are you sure we have sufficient\n> weaponry, sir? I've never been on a raid like this before.\"\n>\n> Keedair raised an eyebrow. \"These are Zensunnis, boy, pacifists to the\n> core. When the thinking machines came, these cowards didn't have the\n> balls to fight. I doubt we'll come out of it with so much as a bruise.\n> Trust me, you'll never see so much gnashing of teeth and wringing of\n> hands. They're pathetic.\"\n>\n> He opened the comchannel and spoke to his harvesting crew. \"Knock the\n> poles out from under three outlying huts and dump them into the water.\n> That'll bring people running out. Then we'll use stun-projectors.\" His\n> voice was calm, a bit bored. \"We'll have plenty of time to round up\n> the valuable ones. If there are any severe injuries, take them for the\n> organ stockpiles, but I'd prefer intact bodies.\"\n>\n> Hannem gazed at him worshipfully. Keedair spoke again into the\n> comchannel. \"There'll be profits enough for everyone, and a bonus for\n> each young male and fertile female you take without damage.\"\n>\n> The linked pilots raised a cheer, then the four raider ships swooped\n> toward the helpless swamp village. Young Hannem held back as the\n> more-experienced slavers flew in. With hot beams, they chopped through\n> the tall poles and let the rickety huts topple into the murky water.\n>\n> \"Well--- open fire, boy!\" Keedair said.\n>\n> Hannem discharged his weapons, disintegrating one of the thick support\n> legs and strafing open the side of a hut wall, setting the reeds on\n> fire.\n>\n> \"Not so much destruction,\" Keedair said, forcing a veneer of calm over\n> his impatience. \"You don't want to harm the villagers. We haven't even\n> had a chance to look them over yet.\"\n>\n> Just as he had predicted, the pathetic Zensunni came boiling out of\n> their huts. Some shimmied down ladders and poles to reach wobbly boats\n> tied up against their hovels.\n>\n> At the edge of the village, the two human-cargo ships landed in the\n> marsh water with hissing splashes, their friction-hot hulls creating\n> steam. Pontoons opened up to keep the ships afloat, and loading ramps\n> extended to solid-looking grassy hummocks.\n>\n> Keedair directed Hannem to land near the scurrying knots of people.\n> Some splashed into the waist-deep water, while women dragged children\n> into reed thickets and young men brandished spears that looked more\n> suitable for catching fish than for warfare.\n>\n> The first Tlulaxa raiders set down gently, extending flat-footed\n> landing struts that sank into the mud. By the time Keedair emerged\n> onto a mound of trampled grasses with his stun-projector in his hands,\n> his companions were already out and opening fire, selecting their\n> targets carefully.\n>\n> The healthy men were marked first, because they were worth the most on\n> the Poritrin market, and because they were the likeliest to cause\n> trouble, if given the chance.\n>\n> Keedair handed the stun weapon to a grinning but intimidated Ryx\n> Hannem. \"Better start shooting, boy, if you want to bag any of this\n> booty.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> THE BOY ISHMAEL confidently guided his boat along the waterways,\n> threading his way through the maze of creeks and passages. The reeds\n> were much taller than his head, even when he stood up in the wobbly\n> little craft. The orange flowers at tops of the reeds opened and\n> closed with smacking sounds, feasting on gnats that drifted through\n> the air.\n>\n> Eight years old, Ishmael had been foraging by himself for a long time\n> now. His maternal grandfather, who had raised him after the death of\n> his parents, had taught him well. Ishmael knew how to unearth secret\n> stashes of qaraa eggs that even the giant eels couldn't find.\n>\n> He'd found a good patch of salad leaves and had caught two fish, one\n> of a species he'd never seen before. His basket clattered and jiggled\n> as the venomous creatures inside crawled up and down the walls,\n> thrusting spiny black legs through the tiny holes. He had captured\n> eighteen milkbugs today, too, each as large as his hand. The family\n> would eat well tonight!\n>\n> But as he approached the village, guiding his boat smoothly through\n> the brown water, Ishmael heard shouts and screams along with buzzing\n> sounds. Static discharges. Ishmael paddled quickly but cautiously. The\n> reeds were too tall for him to see anything.\n>\n> As he rounded an oxbow, he saw the slaver ships, one of the biggest\n> fears of his tribe and the reason they had built their village in such\n> an isolated place. Several huts had been toppled, while others were\n> afire. Impossible!\n>\n> The boy wanted to yell and charge in fighting, but better judgment\n> told him to flee. Ishmael watched Tlulaxa slavers pointing their\n> stun-projectors, dropping one villager after another. Some of the\n> people tried to hide inside dwellings, but raiders smashed their way\n> through.\n>\n> The Zensunni had no locks on their doors, no shielded places to hide.\n> As followers of Buddallah, they were a peaceful people. Never had\n> there been war among villages on Harmonthep; at least Ishmael had\n> never heard of such a thing.\n>\n> His heart pounded. Such a loud commotion would attract the giant eels,\n> though the predators were generally sluggish in the daytime. If these\n> raiders did not quickly retrieve stunned villagers who had fallen into\n> the water, the eels would have a feast. . . .\n>\n> Without making so much as a ripple on the water, Ishmael moved his\n> boat closer to one of the raider ships. He saw his cousin Taina\n> crumple from a stun-blast and then be grabbed by dirty-looking men who\n> loaded her motionless body onto a wide metal raft.\n>\n> Ishmael didn't know what to do. He heard a roaring sound in his\n> ears--- his own blood flowing, his gasping breath.\n>\n> Then his grandfather, Weyop, pushed forward to the center of the huts,\n> and faced the chaos. The old leader carried a thin bronze gong\n> dangling from a pole, symbol of his office as the village spokesman.\n> Ishmael's grandfather did not seem at all afraid, and the boy felt\n> instant relief. He had faith in the wise man, who always found a way\n> to resolve disputes. Weyop would save the villagers now.\n>\n> But deep in his heart, Ishmael felt a terrible dread, knowing that\n> this would not end so simply.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> RYX HANNEM PROVED to be a fairly good shot. After the novice had\n> stunned his first captive, he continued with enthusiasm. Keedair kept\n> a mental count, estimating the haul, though he would not have an\n> accurate tally until the unconscious bodies were placed inside stasis\n> coffins for transport.\n>\n> Keedair clenched his jaw as the Zensunnis wailed and pleaded---\n> probably in much the same manner as the population of Giedi Prime had\n> begged during the recent thinking-machine conquest. Keedair had\n> business associates in Giedi City, but he doubted he'd ever see them\n> alive again.\n>\n> No, he couldn't dredge up any sympathy for these Zensunni bastards.\n>\n> Hannem called attention to an old man who stepped forward. \"What does\n> he think he's doing, sir?\" The old man repeatedly banged a metallic\n> gong on a long staff. Hannem raised his stunner. \"Do we take him?\"\n>\n> Keedair shook his head. \"Too old. Don't even waste a stun-blast on\n> him.\"\n>\n> Two of the experienced slavers thought the same way. They broke the\n> tribal leader's staff and pushed him into the water, then laughed when\n> he shouted curses in a mixture of his native tongue and Galach, a\n> universal language among the human planets. The humiliated old man\n> swam to shore.\n>\n> The remaining villagers wailed and wept, but most of the healthy young\n> ones were already stunned and in the boats. Old women and dirty\n> children cried out, but attempted no resistance. Keedair looked\n> knowingly at Ryx Hannem.\n>\n> Suddenly a boy sprang out of the reeds behind them, jumping from a\n> narrow boat. He threw sticks at Hannem and Keedair, yelling something\n> about his grandfather. Keedair ducked. A rock narrowly missed him.\n>\n> Then the boy grabbed a basket out of his boat and hurled it at Hannem.\n> The flimsy wickerwork broke and spilled a swarm of huge spiny-legged\n> insects that tumbled over Hannem's chest and face, biting. The copilot\n> let out a thin shriek as he batted at the creatures, squashing them,\n> but they continued to scramble up his arms and clothes. Their smashed\n> bodies oozed a thick milky substance that looked like pus.\n>\n> Keedair grabbed Hannem's stun-projector and directed it at the scrappy\n> youth. As the boy fell, Keedair also sprayed his copilot with a\n> paralyzing blast. It wasn't the best way, but at least it\n> incapacitated the aggressive venomous insects, in addition to Hannem.\n> Once aboard the cargo ship, they would put the injured slaver into a\n> stasis coffin, along with the new captives. Keedair didn't know if the\n> lad would die, or just have nightmares for the rest of his life.\n>\n> He shouted for the rest of the Tlulaxa to gather up the unconscious\n> people. It looked as if they might need the second cargo ship after\n> all. *Not a bad*\n>\n> *day*, he thought. He studied the motionless form of the native boy;\n> the scrappy Zensunni youth was certainly impetuous and foolish. This\n> one would be a handful for whichever human master purchased him.\n>\n> But that wasn't Keedair's concern. Let Poritrin deal with the problem.\n> Even stunned and dirty, the wiry boy looked healthy enough, though\n> maybe a little young to take with the other slaves. Out of annoyance,\n> Keedair decided to include the youth anyway. This one had caused him\n> trouble and might need punishment, especially if Hannem ended up\n> dying.\n>\n> The old village elder stood on the shore, soaking wet, shouting\n> Buddislamic sutras at the raiders, telling them the errors of their\n> ways. Bodies floated in the water, facedown. Some of the desperate\n> villagers used poles to nudge the bodies back toward shore, sniveling\n> and wailing the whole time.\n>\n> Keedair saw large black serpentine forms swimming along the narrow\n> canals, attracted by the noise. One of them raised its head out of the\n> water and snapped a fang-filled mouth. The sight of the ferocious\n> animal sent a shudder down Keedair's back. Who knew what other\n> creatures lived around here?\n>\n> Anxious to be away from the stinking swamps, he urged his crew to\n> hurry. He watched as the new slaves were loaded onto the ships. He\n> would be glad to get back aboard his own clean vessel. Nevertheless,\n> the profits from this operation would be well worth the inconvenience\n> and discomfort.\n>\n> When all was ready, he climbed back into his own ship, started the\n> engines and retracted the mud-encrusted stabilizers. As he lifted off\n> into the hazy sky, Tuk Keedair looked down into the marsh and watched\n> the giant eels begin to feed on a few stray bodies.\n>\n> *Mind rules the universe. We must make certain it is the Human mind,\n> rather than the Machine version.*\n\n--- PRIMERO FAYKAN BUTLER,\n\n*Memoirs of the Jihad*\n\n> **Z**ufa Cenva chose her most talented student to be Rossak's first\n> weapon against the cymeks on Giedi Prime. Strong and dedicated, the\n> Sorceress Heoma appeared more than ready to answer the call.\n>\n> From her cliff city on Rossak, Zufa coordinated the operation with the\n> League Armada. The chief Sorceress bit her lower lip and blinked\n> stinging tears of pride from her eyes.\n>\n> Serena Butler's unexpected and ill-advised mission provided the\n> necessary impetus to galvanize the Armada into an offensive. Amidst\n> the arguing and saber-rattling, Xavier Harkonnen had put forth a\n> well-integrated operational plan for the attack. Then he had convinced\n> his commanding officer to let him spearhead the strike. Now, high over\n> Rossak, the battle group of ballista battleships and javelin\n> destroyers was ready to depart from the orbital stations.\n>\n> The initial retaliation against the machine invaders must be a\n> dramatic and complete victory, much more than a localized fight. Each\n> planet affected the others, like the links of a chain. Tercero\n> Harkonnen would lead an Armada battle group, carrying Tio Holtzman's\n> brand new field-portable scramblers to knock out key robotic\n> installations.\n>\n> A Sorceress, though, must deal with the cymeks, whose human brains\n> would be unaffected by the scrambler pulse. Eager for the opportunity,\n> Heoma had accepted her role without hesitation.\n>\n> She was a lean young woman, twenty-three years old, with ivory-white\n> hair, almond eyes, and a plain-featured face that belied the strength\n> and turmoil within her powerful mind. But Zufa knew more than just\n> this woman's\n>\n> mental skills; she knew Heoma as a dear person, a daughter like she\n> wished she'd had herself. Heoma was the eldest of five sisters; three\n> of the others had already been indoctrinated as Sorceress trainees.\n>\n> Zufa stood before her top prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and placed her hands on Heoma's bony\n> shoulders. \"You understand how much rides on this. I know you will not\n> disappoint me, or humanity.\"\n>\n> \"I will achieve everything you expect of me,\" Heoma promised. \"Perhaps\n> even more.\"\n>\n> Zufa's heart swelled. As the straight-backed Heoma boarded the\n> shuttle, the chief Sorceress called after her, \"You won't be alone. We\n> all ride on your wings.\"\n>\n> During the final preparations, with stern words and a hard expression,\n> Zufa had spoken to the strongest Rossak men, chastising them for their\n> inability to play a useful part in the crucial fight. Simply because\n> they were impotent telepathically did not preclude their participation\n> in other ways. The assault on Giedi Prime needed their help as well.\n> With her flinty gaze, the statuesque Sorceress had shamed six of them\n> into accompanying Heoma as bodyguards.\n>\n> The Rossak men brought their personal supplies of stimulants and\n> mind-numbing painkillers, provided by Aurelius Venport. They had\n> undergone rigorous weapons training and learned powerful hand-to-hand\n> combat techniques. When the time came, they would become fanatic\n> warriors, charging into battle with no concern for their own survival,\n> with no goal but to enable the Sorceress weapon to get close enough to\n> the cymeks. Venport had prepared the drugs carefully, creating a\n> cocktail that would keep the men functional through the worst horrors.\n>\n> As she watched the shuttle ascend in a silvery arc to the waiting\n> javelins and ballistas, Zufa's thoughts were in turmoil, full of\n> regret and anticipation. She tried to wall those emotions behind a\n> shield of confidence and a vow of duty.\n>\n> Aurelius Venport came to stand silently beside her, as if he too was\n> at a loss for words. The man was perceptive enough to pick up on\n> Zufa's sadness at seeing her prize student depart. \"It'll be all\n> right.\"\n>\n> \"No it won't. But she will succeed.\"\n>\n> Venport looked at her with a warm understanding that penetrated Zufa's\n> prickly demeanor. \"I know you wish you could have been the first\n> weapon yourself, my dear. Heoma is certainly talented, but *you* are\n> unquestionably more skilled than anyone. Just remember that you're\n> still recovering from your miscarriage, and that weakness might have\n> jeopardized the mission.\"\n>\n> \"And I am bound by the higher responsibility of training others.\" Zufa\n> watched the shuttle disappear into the thin clouds. \"I have no choice\n> but to remain here and do what I can.\"\n>\n> \"Funny. I was thinking the same thing about my own work.\"\n>\n> Recalling the gullible male bodyguards, the Sorceress studied her mate\n> with undisguised scorn. His patrician eyes were incisive, clear of\n> corrupting drugs, but his independent attitude grated on her. \"Why did\n> you not volunteer to join the operation, Aurelius? Or is it not in you\n> to do something selfless, beyond your perception of yourself?\"\n>\n> \"I am a patriot in my own way.\" Venport returned her expression with a\n> wry smile. \"But I never expect you to see it.\"\n>\n> She had no response for that, and the two of them continued to stare\n> blankly at the sky long after the shuttle had reached the stations in\n> orbit.\n>\n> *I don't believe there is such a thing as a \"lost cause\"--- only those\n> without suitably dedicated followers.*\n\n--- SERENA BUTLER,\n\n*address to League Parliament*\n\n> **D**espite Magnus Sumi's optimistic report, the secondary\n> shield-transmitting station on Giedi Prime was not at all near\n> completion.\n>\n> When Serena's covert team landed on the rocky, wind-swept island in\n> the northern sea, they spent a day bringing their supplies and\n> equipment to shore, breaking open the barracks buildings and\n> restarting the power-generating huts. The parabolic towers for the\n> scrambler-shield transmitters stood like frost-encrusted skeletons.\n> But none of the systems were functional.\n>\n> Once Brigit Paterson had scanned the status of the work, the engineer\n> came to Serena with a frown on her wind-chapped face. \"The best I can\n> say is that it won't be *impossible* to complete the work.\" She\n> shrugged her broad shoulders. \"The framework and heavy construction\n> are all completed, but most of the components have not yet been wired.\n> The substations aren't linked, and the cables haven't even been strung\n> to the highest girders.\" She pointed to the ice-slick bars moaning in\n> the breeze.\n>\n> Serena did not envy the volunteer who would climb up there and finish\n> the vital linkages. \"We don't know exactly when Xavier is bringing the\n> Armada for us, but if you're not done by the time those ships arrive,\n> we may as well not bother.

It's a\n> touchy process.\"\n>\n> \"How much time?\" Ort Wibsen asked, chewing on his own impatience.\n>\n> \"A week, if we're lucky.\" Brigit frowned. \"Ten days if anything goes\n> wrong and we need to fix pieces.\"\n>\n> \"Eight days is the absolute soonest the Armada could arrive,\" Serena\n> said. \"That assumes Xavier organized the attack force and launched\n> within two days of receiving my message.\"\n>\n> Wibsen grumbled, \"That'll never happen with the League. They'll call\n> meeting after meeting, then break for long lunches, then hold more\n> meetings.\"\n>\n> Serena sighed. \"I'm hoping Xavier can cut through all that.\"\n>\n> \"Yeah,\" Wibsen said, \"and I'm hoping the robots will all just leave\n> Giedi Prime voluntarily . . . but it's not bloody likely to happen.\"\n>\n> \"Keep your engineers busy,\" Serena said to Brigit Paterson, paying no\n> heed to the veteran's pessimism. \"Commander Wibsen and I will take the\n> blockade runner.

The old veteran didn't\n> answer, but raced across the deck and dove inside the single lifepod.\n>\n> \"What's he doing?\" Jibb said.\n>\n> \"No time to court-martial him now.\" Serena couldn't believe the\n> veteran would just leave them to the thinking machines.\n>\n> Wibsen sealed the hatch of the lifepod and green lights shone around\n> the rim, indicating he was preparing for launch.\n>\n> Serena shot another blast from the starboard weapons, the only ones\n> aimed toward the oncoming thinking machines. She crippled another\n> vessel, but in a united effort, the cymeks and robots fired at the\n> blockade runner, ripping open the weapons ports. Serena looked with\n> dismay at her control systems. They flickered, sparked, went dead.\n>\n> With a lurch and an explosive thump, Wibsen's lifepod shot out like a\n> cannonball. It roared away, a fast-moving, heavily armored projectile,\n> barely skimming over the surface. Over the SOS frequency, the old\n> veteran said, \"Don't be asleep at the switch, now. Be ready!\"\n>\n> Pinquer Jibb powered up their engines, preparing to fly. The ship\n> began to cut a line through the water.\n>\n> Wibsen did his best to aim the lifepod toward the robotic targets.\n> Designed simply to carry a survivor to safety from a catastrophic\n> explosion, the escape vessel had thick shielding and hull plating---\n> and when it hammered into the closest enemy, it annihilated the cymek\n> ship, blasting all the way through and slamming into a second.\n> Battered and smoking amid the sinking wreckage, the lifepod came to a\n> halt.\n>\n> Serena shouted to Jibb. \"Go! Take off!\"\n>\n> He increased thrust, and the blockade runner lifted off from the\n> water, heaving itself into the sky. As they climbed, Serena looked at\n> the imager that showed the water below.\n>\n> In the wreckage of the two thinking-machine aerofoils, she saw the\n> lifepod hatch open. Wibsen emerged, battered but still defiant. Around\n> him, smoke and steam roiled into the air, and three angry cymeks\n> churned toward him.\n>\n> The old veteran reached into his pocket and hurled a dull gray sphere\n> at the nearest cymek vessel. The explosion knocked the enemy back and\n> also sent Wibsen toppling into the lifepod's hatch. He waved a pulse\n> cartridge rifle unsteadily with one hand, shooting again and again,\n> but three armored cymeks pounced upon him from their own aerofoil\n> vessels. Serena watched in horror as their articulated mechanical\n> claws ripped the old veteran to pieces.\n>\n> \"Hold on!\" Pinquer Jibb shouted, too late. Serena saw robotic vessels\n> aiming their heavy weaponry along the trajectory of the fleeing\n> blockade runner.\n>\n> \"I can't---\"\n>\n> The impact smashed Serena against the far wall.

The blockade runner careened\n> into the waves like a huge out-of-control sled, spraying up a high\n> tail of white foam. Water began to gush through cracks in the hull.\n>\n> Serena ran to the weapons locker, grabbed a pulse cartridge rifle of\n> her own. Slinging the weapon over her shoulder, though she had never\n> fired one before, she made ready to defend herself. Pinquer Jibb\n> grabbed another weapon from the open armory closet.\n>\n> With clanging sounds like impacting torpedoes, cymeks slammed into the\n> crippled ship. Without even attempting to use the normal access\n> hatches,\n>\n> they cut their way through the hull, ripping into the central\n> compartment like birds trying to get at the tasty meat inside a\n> seashell.\n>\n> Jibb opened fire as the first silvery arms protruded through the split\n> wall. A pulse-bolt damaged the cymek's arm but also ricocheted around\n> the ship's interior, inadvertently blasting the breach even wider.\n>\n> Another cymek came in from the top hatch, prying open the armor and\n> dropping its limber body into the chamber.

The copilot turned and\n> attempted to fire again, but the cymek thrust a long pointed arm\n> forward. Jibb dropped his gun as the robotic arm plunged through his\n> chest like a spear. Blood blossomed from the center of his uniform.\n>\n> The morphing end of the sharp leg shaft suddenly sprouted clawlike\n> fingers, and as the cymek yanked his hand back out of his victim's\n> chest, he tore out the dripping heart and held it up like a trophy.\n>\n> Above, the largest cymek threw the nonfunctional body of his dead\n> mechanical companion at Serena. The heavy hulk crashed down, cutting\n> and bruising her. Trapped, she couldn't move, pinned to the deck.\n>\n> The beetle cymek, blood still dripping from its spearlike limb,\n> wrenched its way through the gaping hull and clattered forward,\n> leaving Jibb's body behind. It raised two more pointed forearms above\n> Serena, but the largest cymek bellowed for him to stop.\n>\n> \"Don't kill them both or we'll have nothing to give Erasmus.

Gashes\n> in her arm, her ribs, and her left leg were bleeding onto the deck.\n>\n> Jibb's killer snatched the pulse projectile rifle out of her hands,\n> while the larger cymek lifted away the fallen body. He stretched out a\n> grappling arm and snagged her with a flexible metal fist. The Titan\n> lifted her off the deck, then held her face close to his glittering\n> optic threads.\n>\n> \"Oh, so lovely. Even after a thousand years, I can still appreciate\n> beauty.

He could hardly grasp the wealth at his\n> disposal, and he hadn't even begun to uncover all the strange\n> technological objects from the Old Empire.\n>\n> He remembered when he and his turncoat friend Ebrahim had scavenged\n> the desert with other Zensunni, including Naib Dhartha and his young\n> son Mahmad. Once, Selim had found a melted knob of fused circuitry,\n> obviously from an exploded ship. It had been sand-scoured into an\n> unusual, colorful conglomerate. He had wanted to give the trinket to\n> Glyffa, the old woman who had sometimes taken care of him. But Ebrahim\n> had grabbed the fused component and rushed off to show it to Naib\n> Dhartha, asking if he could keep it as a treasure. Instead, the Naib\n> had taken it from him and tossed it into a pile sold to a scrap\n> merchant. No one had given a thought for Selim. . . .\n>\n> Still, as the time in this place drifted into weeks he discovered\n> aspects and dimensions of loneliness. Day after day he sat in front of\n> the scratched windows, watching the storms fade, bringing bloodred\n> sunsets splashed with colorful hues. He looked out at the clean dunes\n> undulating toward the\n>\n> endless horizon. The immense mounds had metamorphosed like living\n> creatures, yet in essence they always remained the same.\n>\n> Across such an expanse, it seemed impossible that he would ever see\n> another human being again. But Buddallah would give him a sign of what\n> he was expected to do. He just hoped it came soon.\n>\n> Much of the time Selim occupied himself inside the empty station with\n> solitary games he'd learned to play when he was younger. In the\n> village, he had been ostracized by others who traced their paternity\n> back a dozen generations or more, even before the wanderers'arrival on\n> Arrakis.\n>\n> From the time he'd been a toddler, Selim had been raised by different\n> Zensunni, none of whom had adopted him as part of their family. He had\n> always been an impulsive and energetic lad. Any real mother would have\n> been patient with his mischievous misbehavior, but Selim had no real\n> mother. On Arrakis, where survival balanced on a razor's edge, few\n> would expend effort for a young man who seemed intent on making\n> nothing of himself.\n>\n> Once, he had accidentally spilled water--- an entire day's ration---\n> while working in a storage alcove. As punishment, Naib Dhartha had\n> denied him any fluids for two days, insisting that he must learn his\n> lesson if he was to be a part of the tribe. But Selim had never seen\n> such a punishment inflicted on any others who had committed comparable\n> mistakes.\n>\n> When he'd been only eight Standard Years old, he had gone exploring\n> out on the cliffs and rocks, hunting lizards, searching for hardy\n> weeds with edible roots. While he was out there a sandstorm had caught\n> him by surprise, hurling dust and grit against the mountains, forcing\n> him into shelter.

He had always accepted Ebrahim's manipulations at face\n> value, without considering the possibility that the other boy might be\n> taking advantage of him. Selim had been slow to learn his lesson, and\n> did so only after paying the price of exile into the desert, where he\n> was expected to die.\n>\n> But he had lived. He had ridden Shaitan, and Buddallah had guided him\n> to this hidden place. . . .\n>\n> While the long storms made him restless, Selim became more determined\n> in exploring the research station.

But they had found little of interest.\n>\n> \"This will be our last recording,\" said the chief scientist in an\n> obscure Galach dialect that Selim found barely comprehensible.

She opened the side hatch and ordered her pumped-up\n> bodyguards to clear the way. Dutifully, she transmitted an all-clear\n> signal to\n>\n> her escort kindjals. One pilot responded as he streaked upward, \"Melt\n> the bastards.\" The fighters zoomed into the sky toward the second wave\n> of troop transports dropping ground assault teams into the\n> robot-infested city.\n>\n> The next part of the mission was in her hands.\n>\n> Heoma stepped away from the smoking craft, then gestured for her\n> glassy-eyed defenders to hurry toward the governor's citadel. She\n> loped after them, the target clear in her mind.\n>\n> Behind her, the battered transport craft exploded in its programmed\n> self-destruct sequence. Heoma didn't flinch. She had never intended to\n> leave herself any option of retreat.\n>\n> The bodyguards carried projectile launchers and disrupter guns. Such\n> artillery would have been too bulky for a normal man to carry, but\n> with their chemically enhanced muscles the men had superhuman strength\n> . . . at least until the drugs burned their bodies from the inside\n> out.\n>\n> Standing three meters tall, powerful combat robots guarded the\n> approach to the Omnius citadel. Though alert, the thinking machines\n> were more concerned with the Armada ballistas and javelins and the\n> restored scrambler shields than with a few humans running through the\n> streets. What could a handful of trivial *hrethgir* accomplish against\n> the invincible thinking machines?\n>\n> When the robot sentinels moved to block their approach, Heoma's\n> bodyguards opened fire. Without a word, they launched projectiles,\n> blowing the steel robots to debris.\n>\n> Overhead, buzzing watcheyes skimmed building tops and swooped down as\n> the squad ran toward the arched entrance to the Magnus's mansion. The\n> watcheyes kept track of Heoma's movements, reporting everything to the\n> Giedi Prime-- Omnius. But the Sorceress did not slow. Her bodyguards\n> blasted any machine target, holding nothing in reserve.\n>\n> Behind them in the streets, the first Armada troop transports had\n> landed, teams scrambling out and opening fire with handheld weapons.\n> They established a guarded perimeter so that their technicians could\n> set up the first of Holtzman's two prototype field-portable\n> scramblers.\n>\n> The device looked crude and bulky, erected on a sturdy tripod. Cables\n> connected it to the power source of the large troop transport. A\n> single blast from the pulse projector would drain the spacecraft's\n> engine--- and would also disable all unshielded robots for half a\n> kilometer.\n>\n> \"Clear!\" the technician shouted. Many of the soldiers covered their\n> ears as if expecting a thunderous artillery burst.\n>\n> Heoma heard only a thin, high whine, then a faint popping in the\n> fabric of the air. Sparks and smoke showered out of Holtzman's\n> prototype, and all the glimmering lights on the transport vehicle went\n> dead.\n>\n> Then, with a clatter like a metal hailstorm, hundreds of dead\n> watcheyes tumbled out of the air, striking the paved streets.\n> Lumbering machine warriors ground to a halt. More robot-driven\n> aircraft wavered in the sky, out of control, and tumbled to the\n> ground.\n>\n> A ragged cheer went up from the Armada soldiers still emerging from\n> their transports, building in enthusiasm as they saw that they had\n> established a foothold, a zone where most of the enemy robots had been\n> eliminated.\n>\n> Heoma had to complete her mission before she endangered any of the\n> other brave human soldiers. \"Inside! Hurry.\"\n>\n> She and her bodyguards rushed into the corridors of the government\n> citadel. As Zufa Cenva had taught her, she concentrated on building up\n> her telepathic powers until her mind ached with a surging power.\n>\n> Deep in the citadel, Heoma's squad encountered two interlocked robots,\n> still functional but disoriented. Apparently the thick walls of the\n> building had protected them from the brunt of the scrambler pulse. The\n> robots stood in front of them, cannon-arms raised, but Heoma\n> discharged a blast of\n>\n> telekinesis that knocked them sideways, helpless against an offensive\n> they could not see or comprehend. Before the staggering robots could\n> regain their feet, Heoma's bodyguards destroyed them with heavy\n> projectile fire.\n>\n> *Almost there.*\n>\n> Running at full tilt, she led the way toward the nexus of the\n> thinking-machine citadel, triggering alarms all the way. Many robots\n> had fallen inactive in rooms or halls, but others converged upon her.\n> Armored doors slammed shut in the corridors, as if to seal off vital\n> chambers, but Heoma could see they were not important. She saw exactly\n> where to go.\n>\n> Soon the cymeks would arrive and surround her. Exactly according to\n> plan.\n>\n> The tingle of mental electricity mounted in her brain like a power\n> transformer. Her skull felt ready to burst, but she did not unleash\n> her energy yet. She must retain all of her strength for one final\n> moment.\n>\n> She heard their crablike warrior-forms skittering down the corridor,\n> ominous sounds of sophisticated machine bodies guided by the brains of\n> human traitors, different from the regimented lockstep of the robotic\n> guards.\n>\n> \"It is almost our time,\" she announced to the fiery-eyed Rossak men,\n> her voice filled with excitement and barely suppressed fear.\n>\n> Skidding to a halt, she arrived within the main chamber where the\n> shielded core of the Omnius manifestation dwelled. Inside the armored\n> room, numerous watcheyes glared at her through glowing optic threads.\n>\n> A voice boomed out from myriad sources. \"Human--- are you wearing a\n> bomb, a pitifully weak explosive that you think can harm me? Did you\n> bring one of your atomics, or is victory not worth such a price to\n> you?\"\n>\n> \"I am not so na\u00efve, Omnius.\" Heoma tossed her sweaty white hair over\n> her shoulder. \"One person cannot possibly harm the great computer\n> evermind. That requires a much more extensive military strike. I'm no\n> more than one woman.\"\n>\n> As the giant cymeks approached from adjoining corridors, Omnius\n> simulated a laugh. \"Humans rarely admit the folly of their own\n> actions.\"\n>\n> \"I admitted no such thing.\" Heoma's skin was glowing red now, heated\n> with unnatural energy. Static electricity made her pale hair wave like\n> angry serpents. \"You have merely misjudged my purpose.\"\n>\n> The doors opened and three monstrous cymeks glided in with graceful\n> metal footsteps, as if savoring the capture of these humans. Heoma's\n> bodyguards turned and opened fire, using the last of their ammunition\n> to cripple one of the neo-cymeks in a single concerted attack.\n>\n> The second neo-cymek raised his integral weapons and vaporized the\n> fearless Rossak men into clouds of bloody pulp. The damaged neo-cymek\n> lay on the floor, its arms and legs twitching like a poisoned insect\n> not yet ready to succumb to death. The larger Titan cymek strode\n> forward.\n>\n> Now Heoma stood alone against the machines. Without moving, she\n> focused her mental powers, building to the point where she could\n> barely maintain even a shred of control.\n>\n> \"I am Barbarossa,\" said the cymek. \"I have squashed so many *hrethgir*\n> that it would take a computer to count them all.\" He and his companion\n> cymek came closer. \"Rarely have I witnessed such arrogance.\"\n>\n> \"Arrogance? Or confidence?\" Heoma smiled. \"Removing a Titan from the\n> equation is a worthy exchange for my life.\"\n>\n> The Sorceress's mental energy could do no damage to the hardened\n> gelcircuits of Omnius itself. Human minds, however, were more\n> vulnerable to her telepathic onslaught. She felt the flames of\n> vengeful energy cresting within her mind--- and released them in a\n> white-hot firestorm.\n>\n> The shockwave of psychic annihilation boiled the brains of Barbarossa\n> and his companion, as well as all other cymeks and hapless biologicals\n> crowded inside the citadel complex. Omnius let out a wordless bellow\n> of static and\n>\n> outrage. Heoma saw only white as her mental energy vaporized the\n> organic brains of the cymek generals.\n>\n> Leaving the newly installed evermind vulnerable.\n>\n> Outside, League ground troops waited for the telepathic firestorm to\n> fade, then surged forward to attack the now-defenseless stronghold of\n> Omnius.\n>\n> The work of recapturing Giedi Prime had begun.\n>\n> *Nothing is permanent.*\n>\n> --- Cogitor saying\n>\n> **W**ithin an hour of the transmitting facility's activation, the\n> cymeks and surface-confined robots had pinpointed its location. While\n> the battle raged in Giedi City, even after Barbarossa had been\n> annihilated, a kill squadron of neo-cymeks and robots was dispatched\n> to the northern sea. They surrounded the rocky, ice-covered island to\n> penetrate the compound and destroy the parabolic transmitting towers.\n>\n> With few weapons, Brigit Paterson's remaining engineers could not\n> possibly defend against such an onslaught, but they had no intention\n> of surrendering, either. Inside the main control center, she scanned\n> the skies and sea. \"The longer we hold out here, the more lives we'll\n> save.\"\n>\n> Pasty-faced and drawn with terror, the desperate engineers armed\n> themselves with grenades, pulse-projectile rifles, and a portable\n> artillery launcher and went to guard the quays and aerial approaches\n> to the island.\n>\n> The machine kill squadron did not issue ultimatums; they began their\n> attack as soon as they were in range.

They reloaded, making their dwindling\n> ammunition count.\n>\n> The cymeks and robots were more intent on obliterating the towers than\n> on killing the few defenders.

When a cymek shot knocked one transmitter offline, the shields\n> began to fade, but Brigit finessed the controls. Her cold fingers\n> flew, rerouting to more stable sections of the tower, and soon she had\n> a functional shield in place again. She didn't know how long it would\n> last.\n>\n> Outside, she heard explosions and screams, making her wonder how many\n> of her engineers remained alive. Her screens flickered as the sensors\n> were damaged in the firestorm, and she saw more ships approaching,\n> probably machine reinforcements. A whole squadron.\n>\n> Then louder detonations rang out in the water, and the cymeks began to\n> scramble. Robot vessels exploded, targeted by oncoming kindjals flown\n> by human pilots. She heard a ragged cheer from a woefully small number\n> of voices. The League Armada had sent rescuers to defend the shield\n> facility.\n>\n> Weak with relief, Brigit slumped into her chair, glad that this risky\n> scheme had worked. When she got home, she promised she would buy\n> Serena Butler the finest, most expensive bottle of wine available in\n> the whole League of Nobles.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AFTER HEOMA'S MIND-STRIKE obliterated the cymek enforcers, Holtzman's\n> second portable scrambler knocked out the robots in another section of\n> the city. The Omnius core was damaged and vulnerable.\n>\n> Surviving robotic defenders mounted a strong resistance, willing to\n> sacrifice anything to keep humans from reclaiming the planet and\n> destroying the evermind. While Xavier Harkonnen fought against\n> thinking-machine spaceships in his giant ballistas, he dispatched four\n> javelin destroyers to help secure the surface. Squadron after squadron\n> of kindjals soared over targets, wrecking the embryonic machine\n> infrastructure, crippling any robots that had been beyond the range of\n> the field-portable scramblers.\n>\n> Armada troop transports dumped soldiers onto the battleground to seek\n> out and sabotage thinking-machine strongholds. Scanner ships sent\n> messages to rally any knots of human resistance, calling for others to\n> rise up and join the fighting.\n>\n> In response, distraught men, women, and children surged out of\n> buildings, breaking away from slave gangs. They ran through the\n> streets with any weapons they could find, some recovered from fallen\n> robots.\n>\n> As the tide of battle began to turn, Xavier issued a set of general\n> orders, delegating responsibilities and mop-up zones to the Armada\n>\n> subcommanders. Then he set out with elite search teams to find Serena\n> Butler.\n>\n> He flew directly to the island in the northern sea where commando\n> engineers had restored the shield-generating facility. He expected to\n> find Serena there, since this had been her scheme all along. Xavier\n> looked around, studying the bodies with dread, but saw no sign of\n> Serena or the old veteran Ort Wibsen. Nor did he see her blockade\n> runner.\n>\n> When he encountered Brigit Paterson standing outside in the cold\n> breeze without seeming to feel the chill, she was exuberant with their\n> victory. In a booming voice, she said, \"We did it, Tercero! I would\n> never have bet a single credit on our odds of success, but Serena knew\n> what she was doing. I can't believe she pulled us through.\"\n>\n> Xavier felt ready to melt with relief. \"Where is she?\"\n>\n> \"She's not with the Armada?\" Brigit frowned. \"She left here days ago\n> to intercept your ships and inform you of what we had accomplished.\"\n> She blinked, suddenly disturbed. \"We thought she'd given you all the\n> information.\"\n>\n> \"No, we came because of the message she left me on Salusa.\" Xavier's\n> heart leaped with sudden fear, and his voice dropped to a frigid\n> whisper. \"Something must have happened. God, I hope not.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> XAVIER TOOK A small contingent of kindjals with his best pilots.\n> Serena was lost somewhere on Giedi Prime.

But Serena and her remaining commandos had not\n>\n> responded to any Armada transmissions. So many things could have\n> happened.\n>\n> Bad things.\n>\n> The Armada had orders for the final phase of the operation on Giedi\n> Prime. Convoys were airlifting survivors away from the damaged\n> government complex in Giedi City. He hoped Serena was not in there.\n>\n> Ten kilometers above the surface, centered over the citadel that had\n> once been the home of Magnus Sumi, the squadron leveled out, and\n> Xavier knew it was time. Only a few months earlier, in those buildings\n> below, he and his inspection team had been hosted by the Magnus at a\n> banquet.\n>\n> Now Omnius must be excised like a cancer, obliterated from Giedi\n> Prime.\n>\n> Circling over the wounded metropolis, Xavier hesitated. His stomach\n> knotted, and he finally gave the order to his crew. The kindjals\n> disgorged their deadly loads.\n>\n> Xavier closed his eyes, then forced himself to watch the terrible\n> solution. This was the only way to be certain. Even if shreds of the\n> evermind had been distributed in substations around Giedi Prime, the\n> vigorous occupation force would root out any remnants. For now, the\n> humans must annihilate the computer core that cowered like an evil\n> insect queen in the citadel complex, cut off from all its\n> infrastructure, stripped of its machine protectors.\n>\n> Through the tattered smoke and cloud cover, Xavier watched a dozen\n> high-thermal bombs go off, blazing flashes and thunderclaps over the\n> center of Giedi City, vaporizing the government buildings. For blocks\n> around, even stone melted. Steel turned to ash. Glass vaporized.\n> Nothing could survive.\n>\n> A bittersweet victory . . . but victory nonetheless.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> DURING AN INSPECTION tour two days later, Tercero Harkonnen and his\n> line officers documented the decimation of Giedi City. They already\n> knew what they would find, but the harsh evidence sickened them.\n>\n> Xavier took a deep, shuddering breath and tried to salve his\n> conscience by reminding himself that Omnius had been defeated. The\n> humans had taken the planet back.\n>\n> But there was no sign of Serena.\n\n*There is always a way out, if you can recognize it.*\n\n--- VORIAN ATREIDES,\n\ndebriefing files\n\n> **A**s the *Dream Voyager* finally entered the Ophiuchi B solar system\n> as part of the long update run, Seurat attempted to contact the\n> recently installed Omnius network on Giedi Prime. If General Agamemnon\n> had conquered the *hrethgir* world, as promised, Vor knew they would\n> find the standard machine-run citadel at the world's business hub. It\n> would be another great chapter for his father to include in his\n> memoirs.\n>\n> Vorian stood behind the robot captain, studying the instrument console\n> as they approached. \"I'll bet there's still a lot of organizing and\n> restructuring to do down there.\" He was excited at the opportunity to\n> visit a world in the process of shifting from human unruliness to\n> efficient machine rule. Omnius would need to install the best\n> trustees, those most loyal to the thinking machines. Neo-cymeks would\n> probably take care of the brunt of the subjugation work, and trustees\n> would come in later, once the people were sufficiently tamed and\n> accepting of their new situation.\n>\n> But Vor also felt a little peculiar. The conquered *hrethgir* on Giedi\n> Prime would look like him, though he would feel no kinship with them.\n> *Seurat, and others like him, are more like brothers to me.*\n>\n> At the command console, the robot attempted to lock an onboard signal\n> onto a homing beacon from the citadel. \"No contact yet. Perhaps all\n> the systems are not yet installed on the surface, or Agamemnon caused\n> too much damage during his conquest.\"\n>\n> Vor tended to the monitoring systems. \"Damage can always be repaired,\n> once conquest is assured.\" Ahead, Giedi Prime was illuminated on its\n> dayside by a pale yellow sun. As he stared, his brow furrowed with\n> worry. \"Something doesn't seem quite right, Seurat.\"\n>\n> \"Define your reservations, Vorian Atreides. I can take no action based\n> upon a vague uneasy feeling.\"\n>\n> \"Never mind. Just . . . be careful.\"\n>\n> The *Dream Voyager* skimmed the upper atmosphere, slicing through\n> clouds and scattered particulates that the ship's scoop system\n> analyzed as copious smoke. Could the *hrethgir* have been so vicious\n> and desperate that they had burned their own cities? What loathsome\n> creatures!\n>\n> His stomach lurched as onboard warning systems whined. Seurat promptly\n> altered course, halting their descent and gaining altitude again. \"It\n> appears the scrambler field remains intact on Giedi Prime.\"\n>\n> \"We almost flew into it!\" Vor cried. \"Does that mean---\"\n>\n> \"Perhaps General Agamemnon did not succeed in his conquest. Giedi\n> Prime is not as secure as we were led to expect.\"\n>\n> Irrationally confident that his father would not have failed, Vor ran\n> a sequence of scans. \"Instruments picking up League military equipment\n> on the surface, evidence of recent massive explosions in Giedi City.\"\n> The words caught in his throat. \"The central hub and the local Omnius\n> have been obliterated! All robots and cymeks appear to be destroyed as\n> well.\"\n>\n> \"I am scanning their broadband reports . . . collating a summary.\"\n> Without alarm, the robot recounted his understanding of the portable\n> scramblers, the powerful Sorceress of Rossak who had used mental\n> powers to obliterate the cymeks, then the overwhelming force of the\n> League Armada.\n>\n> Then Seurat said in a maddeningly calm voice, \"Vorian, a fleet of\n> *hrethgir* ships is coming around from behind the planet. They appear\n> to have been waiting for us in ambush.\"\n>\n> Outside, streaks of orange and blue tracer fire came close to hitting\n> the update craft, and the *Dream Voyager*'s automatic systems jolted\n> into\n>\n> evasive maneuvers. League kindjals streaked in like wolves. \"They're\n> barbarians,\" Vor said. \"Eager to destroy anything they don't like.\"\n>\n> Seurat said, \"We are under attack. And the *Dream Voyager* is not a\n> combat-programmed vessel.\" He continued to sound artificially jovial,\n> facetiously this time. \"Someday I will think of a joke about why it\n> takes so many humans to short-circuit an Omnius.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> ALERTED TO THE approach of a single thinking-machine vessel, Tercero\n> Xavier Harkonnen had moved his orbital battle group to the far side of\n> the planet. Some wreckage of robot warships still tumbled in a\n> dispersing swath; Omnius's forces had been completely destroyed.\n>\n> Xavier flew out in a personal kindjal, accompanied by a well-armed\n> squadron. He saw the update ship roar on a steep trajectory toward the\n> damaged main city, then swerve desperately upward as soon as the robot\n> captain detected the scrambler fields. \"Follow me! We can't let it get\n> away.\"\n>\n> Hungry for vengeance, his squadron hurled itself into the pursuit. At\n> the same time, he signaled the ground-based military forces that he\n> had an enemy craft in sight. Ahead, wavering in the crosshairs, the\n> *Dream Voyager* surged forward, trying to evade Armada weapons fire\n> and to escape back into space.\n>\n> Abruptly, Xavier was startled to hear a human voice--- or one that\n> *sounded* human--- coming over the comline. \"Hey, break off your\n> attack! This is a League ship. My name is Vorian Atreides. We have\n> boarded a machine craft and taken control. Stop trying to shoot us\n> down!\"\n>\n> Xavier tried to determine from the tenor if it really was a human\n> voice, or only a clever machine copy. Thinking machines were not\n> devious . . . unless there was a preserved cymek brain aboard. Some of\n> the kindjals dropped back, uncertain.\n>\n> \"Stay on your guard,\" Xavier said to his squadron, \"but cease fire\n> until we figure this out---\"\n>\n> Before he could finish his order, the suspicious ship looped and began\n> firing its own weapons, minimal defensive volleys that nevertheless\n> took the Armada fighters by surprise. One kindjal veered away, its\n> engines damaged.\n>\n> Xavier's console screen showed the image of a human face with dark\n> hair and shining fanatical eyes. A sleek, mirror-faced robot stood\n> next to him, his flexible copperfilm body rippling as he operated the\n> controls of the ship.\n>\n> *A human and a robot, working side by side?* Xavier couldn't believe\n> it.\n>\n> \"Open fire!\" he shouted. \"Destroy that ship.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> \"IT IS NOT wise to provoke them too much, Vorian,\" Seurat said,\n> maddeningly calm. \"I would rather leave here posthaste.\"\n>\n> \"I just gained us a few precious seconds, didn't I? You wouldn't have\n> thought of using a bluff.\" Vor couldn't stop grinning. He had read\n> similar words in the memoirs of Agamemnon and was glad to echo them.\n>\n> As the Armada commander took evasive maneuvers and rallied his kindjal\n> pilots, he hurled insults back at Vor on the comline. \"You are a\n> disgrace to humanity, a traitor!\"\n>\n> Vor laughed, proud of his place here. He quoted what he'd been taught\n> all his life. \"I am the pinnacle of humanity--- a trustee of Omnius,\n> the son of General Agamemnon.\"\n>\n> \"I apologize for interrupting your grand speech, Vorian, but I am\n> detecting more *hrethgir* ships,\" the robot said. \"More than we can\n> evade. Therefore, I am breaking off engagement. Our responsibility is\n> to protect the updates aboard. We have to make our report.\"\n>\n> Vor said grimly, \"If the Giedi Prime-- Omnius is already destroyed, we\n> will never have an update of what it did during its months of\n> operation here. We'll never know what he accomplished.\"\n>\n> \"A grievous loss,\" Seurat said.\n>\n> The robot guided the *Dream Voyager* toward orbit, farther from the\n> deadly scrambler fields. The acceleration pressed Vorian back into his\n> padded seat until he nearly lost consciousness. A squadron of\n> human-operated ships closed in on their tail, and the update ship\n> shuddered as an energy pulse hit the aft section.\n>\n> Seurat dodged, and another volley of blows pounded the hull, damaging\n> the armor plates. This vessel was not made to endure such punishment.\n> Vor heard onboard systems hissing, automated routines making temporary\n> repairs to the damaged parts. Another blast hit, even worse than the\n> others.\n>\n> \"We are operating on reserves,\" Seurat announced. Vor scanned the\n> ship's diagnostics himself, assessing the damage. The air in the cabin\n> began to smell acrid and smoky.\n>\n> The *Dream Voyager* lurched. More kindjals surrounded them, targeting\n> their engines. An explosion jarred Vor to his bones.\n>\n> \"We cannot tolerate much more of this,\" Seurat said. \"Our engines are\n> functioning at only a third of normal capacity, and I am flying as\n> fast as I can.\"\n>\n> \"Head into that high cloud,\" Vor said, as an idea suddenly occurred to\n> him. \"The water vapor is thick enough to act as a projection surface.\"\n>\n> Listening to his enthusiastic copilot, Seurat steered into a giant,\n> towering cloud. The damaged engines strained. More blows came from the\n> pursuing kindjals.\n>\n> Vor worked furiously at the controls, using the ship's sophisticated\n> systems to project virtual copies in its wake, electronic images of\n> the *Dream*\n>\n> *Voyager*. He had hoped to use the scheme in a tactical game with\n> Seurat . . . but this was a different sort of game. If it didn't work,\n> the already-damaged update ship would never survive.\n>\n> Moments later a hundred illusory *Dream Voyagers* seemed to surge\n> through the cloud, solido images reflected on the water vapor.\n> Momentarily confused, the pursuing squadron chased decoys.\n>\n> And the real prey limped away, its pilots stealing up into orbit and\n> hoping to remain unnoticed until they could get out of range. . . .\n>\n> *Even the expected can be a terrible shock when we have been holding\n> on to threads of hope.*\n>\n> --- XAVIER HARKONNEN\n>\n> **W**hile the survivors of Giedi Prime counted their dead, documented\n> the damage, and made plans for the future, Xavier felt hope fading. It\n> seemed that no one on the whole world had seen Serena Butler since\n> she'd departed from the island compound in the northern sea.\n>\n> He took twice his normal shifts aboard scout kindjals, flying regular\n> patterns over the settled continents, where thinking machines had\n> caused the most destruction. If Serena was alive, Xavier knew she\n> would never be hiding. Rather, the determined young woman would be in\n> the midst of the hardest work, taking charge as always.\n>\n> Flying eastward on the next scheduled search pattern, he watched the\n> yellow sun set behind him, leaving splashes of gold and orange in its\n> wake. A powerful gust buffeted his craft, and he fought to control it.\n> Xavier rose to a less-turbulent altitude above the jet-stream, while\n> his squadron followed him.\n>\n> Someday, after he and Serena were married, he could tell this story to\n> their children. His chest tightened at the thought, but he continued\n> his search, not daring to consider what he would do if something had\n> happened to her.\n>\n> From this altitude, Xavier could make out the major geographical\n> outlines of continents and seas as they soaked up the approaching\n> night. Through a powerful scope, he saw the center of a city and made\n> out clusters of lights marking human encampments. During their brief\n> and brutal rule, the machine conquerors had slaughtered countless\n> people and sent millions fleeing into the countryside.\n>\n> Now survivors began to filter back to their homes.

Only\n> scraps of twisted, burned-out hardware and an electronic signaling\n> mechanism remained.\n>\n> But full recovery would take a great deal of time.\n>\n> Xavier hated machines more than anything, but he also believed in\n> honor among men. He could not understand the turncoat Vorian Atreides,\n> who willingly flew beside a robot captain in a thinking-machine spy\n> ship. Brainwashed, obviously, but something in the young man's\n> arrogant demeanor suggested deep convictions . . . a fanatical,\n> single-minded passion. Atreides had claimed to be the \"son\" of\n> Agamemnon, the worst of the cymek Titans.\n>\n> Below, one of the squadron ships veered toward the water in the vast,\n> open sea. \"Tercero Harkonnen, I'm detecting debris in the water below.\n> Metallic wreckage of some sort.\"\n>\n> With sudden dread, Xavier said, \"Check it out.\"\n>\n> Two kindjals swooped down to the open sea.

These captives had been freshly harvested from Giedi Prime and\n> brought to Earth by order of Omnius.

Iblis had read the\n> documentation, knew that the new batch of prisoners might be an unruly\n> lot, considering where they had been captured.\n>\n> As the disheveled and disoriented slaves were herded off the space\n> transport in dirty clothes, Iblis perused them with a trained eye,\n> considering how to segregate them to work assignments, a few artisans,\n> a few skilled workers, most of them mere slaves. He separated out a\n> muscular, mahogany-skinned man for assignment to the Ajax pedestal\n> project, smiling encouragement to him, then dispatched others to crews\n> that required more manpower.\n>\n> One of the last to emerge from the ship was a battered woman who,\n> despite the dark bruises on her face and arms and the weary shock in\n> her expression, carried herself with pride, showing internal strength\n> in every movement. This was the one for Erasmus. *Trouble*.\n>\n> Why would the robot be interested in her? He would probably just\n> vivisect her anyway. A waste. And a shame.\n>\n> Iblis called to her, but she ignored his gentle yet authoritative\n> tone. Finally, with some rough encouragement from the guard robots,\n> she stood in front of him. Though only of average height, the female\n> had striking lavender eyes, amber-brown hair, and a face that might be\n> pretty if cleansed of grime and anger.\n>\n> He smiled warmly, trying to reach out to her with a little charm. \"The\n> records say your name is Serena Linn\u00e9?\" He knew full well who she was.\n>\n> Iblis stared into her eyes and detected a spark of defiance there. She\n> held his gaze, as if she were his equal. \"Yes. My father was a minor\n> official in Giedi City, moderately well-off.\"\n>\n> \"Have you ever worked as a servant before?\" he inquired.\n>\n> \"I have always been a servant--- of the people.\"\n>\n> \"From now on, you serve Omnius.\" He softened his voice. \"I promise\n> you, it won't be so bad. Our workers are treated well here. Especially\n> intelligent ones like yourself. Perhaps you could even aspire to a\n> trusted, privileged position, if you have the intelligence and the\n> personality for it.\" Iblis smiled. \"However, wouldn't it be best if we\n> used your true name . . . Serena Butler?\"\n>\n> She glared at him. At least she didn't deny it. \"How did you know?\"\n>\n> \"After capturing you, Barbarossa inspected the wreckage of your\n> vessel. There were many clues aboard. You are fortunate the cymeks\n> never needed to interrogate you in further detail.\" He glanced at his\n> electronic notes. \"We know you are the daughter of Viceroy Manion\n> Butler. Were you trying to hide your identity out of fear that Omnius\n> might use you in some sort of blackmail scheme? I assure you, that\n> isn't the way the evermind thinks. Omnius would never have considered\n> such a thing.\"\n>\n> She raised her chin defiantly. \"My father would never surrender a\n> centimeter of territory, no matter what the machines do to me.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, yes, you're all very brave, I am sure.\" Iblis gave her a wry\n> smile, meant to be comforting. \"The rest is up to the robot Erasmus.\n> He has requested that you be assigned to his villa. He has taken a\n> particular interest in your circumstances. That's a good sign.\"\n>\n> \"He wishes to help me?\"\n>\n> \"I wouldn't go that far,\" he said with a hint of humor. \"I'm sure\n> Erasmus wants to *talk* with you. And talk and talk and talk. In the\n> end, it's quite likely he will drive you mad with his famous\n> curiosity.\"\n>\n> Iblis instructed other slaves to clean and properly reclothe this\n> female, and they followed the trustee's orders as if he were a machine\n> himself. Although her mannerisms exuded hostility and resentment,\n> Serena Butler did not waste effort on pointless resistance. She had a\n> brain, but her intelligence and spirit were bound to be crushed before\n> long.\n>\n> The routine medical check, however, revealed a surprise. She glared at\n> Iblis, trying to maintain her defensive wall of anger, but a glimmer\n> of curiosity flickered behind her odd lavender eyes. \"Are you aware\n> that you're pregnant? Or is that just an unfortunate accident?\" From\n> the way she reeled, he saw that her reaction was not feigned. \"Yes, by\n> now it appears about three months along. You must have suspected.\"\n>\n> \"That is none of your business.\" Her words were hard, as if she was\n> trying to maintain her hold on something stable. The news seemed to be\n> a greater blow to her than all the rough treatment she had endured\n> since capture.\n>\n> Iblis made a dismissive gesture. \"Every cell in your body is my\n> business--- at least until I deliver you to your new master.\n> Afterward, I will really begin to pity you.\"\n>\n> The independent robot would no doubt plan interesting experiments on\n> her and the fetus. . . .\n>\n> *The psychology of the human animal is malleable, with his personality\n> dependent upon the proximity of other members of the species and the\n> pressures exerted by them.*\n>\n> --- ERASMUS,\n\nlaboratory notes\n\n> **E**rasmus's villa stood as a towering edifice on a hilltop\n> overlooking the sea. On the inland side, the main building loomed high\n> in front of a lovely flagstone square beneath high turrets; toward the\n> coast, a cluster of bleak, crowded slave pens huddled on the opposite\n> side, where human captives lived like livestock.\n>\n> From the highest balconies, the robot found the dichotomy curious.\n>\n> Forming his metal polymer facefilm into a paternal mask, Erasmus\n> watched as two sentinel robots strode through a slave pen, hunting for\n> twin girls that he required for a new round of experiments. The\n> panicked humans scrambled away, but Erasmus didn't shift his pliable\n> face into a frown. His myriad optic threads scanned the lean and dirty\n> forms, assessing.\n>\n> He had seen the little girls a few days before, noting their short\n> black hair and brown eyes, but they seemed to be hiding somewhere.\n> Playing a game with him? The sentinels tore through a doorway into a\n> tunnel that led to another pen; finally, they transmitted back, \"We\n> have located the two subjects.\"\n>\n> *Good*, Erasmus thought, anticipating the intriguing work ahead. He\n> wanted to see if he could force one of the twin girls to kill the\n> other. It would be a landmark experiment, one that would reveal\n> important insights into moral boundaries and how siblings defined\n> them.\n>\n> He especially enjoyed working with identical twins. Over the years he\n> had processed dozens of pairs through his laboratory, compiling\n> detailed medical reports as well as intensive psychological studies.\n> He spent a great\n>\n> deal of effort on meticulous comparative autopsies, microanalyzing the\n> subtle differences in siblings who were genetic carbon-copies. The\n> slave masters working in the crowded pens had instructions to identify\n> and select any new sets among the captive populace on Earth.\n>\n> Finally, the squirming dark-haired twins stood in front of him, held\n> by the sentinel robots. He shifted his pliable facefilm into a calm\n> smile. One of the girls spat on the reflective surface. Erasmus\n> wondered why saliva carried such a negative connotation for humans? It\n> caused no damage and could be cleaned off easily. The forms of human\n> defiance never ceased to amaze him.\n>\n> Shortly before Erasmus had left his estate on Corrin, twenty-two\n> slaves had removed their protective eye films and intentionally stared\n> into the furious red-giant sun, blinding themselves. Disobedient,\n> resistant--- and stupid. What did the rebellious act accomplish, other\n> than rendering them useless for slave work?\n>\n> They had expected to be killed, and Erasmus would oblige them. But not\n> so that they could become martyrs. Instead, he had quietly separated\n> them from other workers to prevent the spread of their unruliness.\n> Blinded, they could not find or earn food. By now, he supposed they\n> must have starved in their self-inflicted darkness.\n>\n> Still, he had marveled at their spirit, their collective will to\n> challenge him. Even though humans were a troublesome breed, they were\n> constantly fascinating.\n>\n> A watcheye buzzed nearby, making strange, raw noises. Finally, Omnius\n> spoke through it. \"The recent loss of Giedi Prime is your fault,\n> Erasmus. I tolerate your endless experiments in the hope that you will\n> deconstruct and analyze human behavior. Why did you not predict the\n> suicidal raid that obliterated my cymeks? The data and experiences of\n> my Giedi Prime counterpart were never backed up. Barbarossa is equally\n> irreplaceable, since he created my original programming.\"\n>\n> The Earth-Omnius already knew about the recapture of Giedi Prime\n> because of an automated emergency buoy launched by the robot Seurat,\n> whose update ship had unexpectedly encountered the disaster in its\n> duties. The alarming message had reached Earth only that morning.\n>\n> \"I was not given data that the Sorceresses of Rossak had developed\n> this capability of telepathic destruction.\" The robot's face shimmered\n> back into its blank oval smoothness. \"Why not also ask your questions\n> of Vorian Atreides when he returns to Earth? The son of Agamemnon has\n> helped us to simulate unstable human behavior before.\"\n>\n> Omnius said, \"Even his input could not have prepared us for what\n> happened to Giedi Prime. Sentient biologicals are unpredictable and\n> reckless.\"\n>\n> As the sentinel robots dragged the squirming twins away, Erasmus\n> directed his attention to the watcheye. \"Then it is obvious I have\n> more work to do.\"\n>\n> \"No, Erasmus, it is obvious that your research is not yielding the\n> desired results. You should strive for perfection, rather than\n> investigating compounded errors. I recommend that you overwrite your\n> mind core with a subset of my program. Turn yourself into a perfect\n> machine. A copy of me.\"\n>\n> \"You would sacrifice our fascinating, open-ended debates?\" Erasmus\n> responded, fighting to conceal his inner alarm. \"You have always\n> expressed an interest in my peculiar manner of thinking. All the\n> everminds especially look forward to your record of my actions.\"\n>\n> The buzzing of the watcheye intensified, indicating that Omnius was\n> shifting his thought pathways. This was a worrisome, volatile\n> situation. Erasmus did not want to lose his carefully developed\n> independent identity.\n>\n> One of the twin girls tried to break away from the robotic guards and\n> run back toward the dubious safety of the pens. As Erasmus had\n> suggested beforehand, the guard lifted her sister by one arm, leaving\n> her to dangle screaming. The free twin hesitated, though she could\n> easily have reached the temporary shelter. Slowly, she came to a stop,\n> surrendering.\n>\n> *Fascinating*, Erasmus thought. And the sentinel robot did not even\n> have to inflict cellular damage on the other girl.\n>\n> Thinking quickly, the robot said, \"Perhaps if I diverted my attention\n> to matters of military significance, you would more easily see the\n> potential of my work. Let me understand the mentality of these wild\n> humans for you. What drives them to such self-sacrifice, as we\n> witnessed on Giedi Prime? If I can distill an explanation, your\n> Synchronized Worlds will no longer be vulnerable to unpredictable\n> attacks.\"\n>\n> The watcheye hovered as a million possibilities showered through the\n> abundant mind of Omnius. Presently, the computer made his decision.\n> \"You have my permission to proceed. But do not continue to test my\n> patience.\"\n>\n> *People require continuity.*\n\n--- BOVKO MANRESA,\n\nFirst Viceroy of the League of Nobles\n\n> **O**n Poritrin, the virulent fever raced through the mudflats and\n> docks where slaves made their dreary homes. Despite the best\n> quarantine and mitigation efforts, the disease killed a number of\n> officials and merchants, and even spread as far as the slaves in Tio\n> Holtzman's blufftop laboratories, where it caused quite a disruption\n> in the scientist's work.\n>\n> When Holtzman first noticed symptoms of the illness among his crowded\n> equation solvers, he immediately ordered removal of the sick ones to\n> isolation chambers and sealed off the remainder of the calculating\n> teams. The distracted Savant thought the slaves would rejoice at being\n> relieved of their mathematical chores; instead the solvers moaned and\n> prayed, asking why the hand of God would strike *them* rather than\n> their oppressors.\n>\n> Within two weeks, half of his household slaves had either died or been\n> quarantined. Such a shift in daily routines was not conducive to the\n> Savant's mental work.\n>\n> Several large-scale simulations had been under way, following the\n> gradual development of parameters established by the talented Norma\n> Cenva. Groaning at the inconvenience, Holtzman knew that stopping the\n> lengthy work in midstream would necessitate new teams to start over\n> again. To maintain his stature, he needed a major breakthrough soon.\n>\n> Lately his reputation had been supported more by Norma's work than his\n> own. Naturally, he had taken full credit for modifying the\n> scrambler-field generators into an offensive weapon. Lord Bludd had\n> delighted in presenting two prototypes to the Armada liberation force\n> for Giedi Prime. Indeed, the scrambler projectors had served the\n> rescuers well, but the prototypes had consumed enough energy to ground\n> two troop transports, and the devices themselves had broken down---\n> irreparably--- after only one\n>\n> use. In addition, the disruptive pulse had yielded uneven results,\n> since many robots had been shielded by walls or unaffected by the\n> dissipating field. Still, the idea showed promise, and the nobles\n> urged Holtzman to work on improvements, without ever knowing about\n> Norma's involvement.\n>\n> At least Holtzman's reputation was secure again. For a while.\n>\n> Norma was quiet but diligent. Rarely interested in diversions or\n> amusements, she worked hard and scrutinized her own ideas. Despite\n> Holtzman's wishes, she insisted on performing most calculations\n> personally rather than handing them off to solver teams. Norma was too\n> independent to understand the economics of delegating tasks. Her\n> dedication made her a rather dull person.\n>\n> After rescuing the young prodigy from her obscurity on Rossak, he had\n> hoped, unrealistically perhaps, that Norma might provide him with\n> sudden inspiration. During a recent cocktail party in Lord Bludd's\n> conical towers, the nobleman had made a joke about Holtzman taking a\n> holiday from his usual brilliance. Though the comment had stung, the\n> inventor had laughed along with the other tittering nobles. Still, it\n> high-lighted--- in his own mind, at least--- that he had not created\n> anything really original in some time.\n>\n> Following a restless night of bizarre dreams, Holtzman finally came up\n> with a concept to explore. Expanding some of the electromagnetic\n> features he had used for his scrambler fields, he might be able to\n> create an \"alloy resonance generator.\" Properly tuned, a thermal-field\n> inducer would couple with metals--- the bodies of robots, for\n> instance, or even the crablike warrior-forms worn by cymeks. Given the\n> correct adjustment, the resonance generator could slam selected metal\n> atoms against each other, generating enormous heat until the machine\n> shook itself apart.\n>\n> The concept seemed promising. Holtzman intended to pursue its\n> development with full enthusiasm and haste.\n>\n> But first he needed more solvers and assistants to construct the\n> prototype. And now he had to waste a day on the mundane task of\n> replacing the\n>\n> household slaves that had died from the fever. With a frustrated sigh,\n> he left his laboratories and trudged down the zigzag trail to the base\n> of the bluffs, where he caught a jetboat across the river.\n>\n> On the opposite shore, at the widest part of the delta, he visited a\n> bustling river market. Rafts and barges had been lashed together for\n> so long that they might well have been part of the landscape. The\n> merchants'quarter was not far from the Starda spaceport, where vendors\n> provided offworld oddities: drugs from Rossak, interesting woods and\n> plants from Ecaz, gems from Hagal, musical instruments from Chusuk.\n>\n> In shops that fronted a narrow alley, tailors were copying the latest\n> Salusan fashions, cutting and sewing exotic imported cloths and fine\n> Poritrin linens. Holtzman had used many of these garment makers to\n> enhance his personal wardrobe. An eminent Savant such as himself could\n> not spend all of his time in the laboratories. After all, he was\n> frequently called upon to make public appearances to answer questions\n> from citizens and often spoke before committees of nobles, to convince\n> them of his continued importance.\n>\n> But today Holtzman made his way farther out onto the floating rafts\n> and barges. He needed to purchase people, not clothes. The scientist\n> saw a sign on the dock ahead, in Galach:HUMAN RESOURCES. He crossed\n> creaking boardwalks and gangplanks to a cluster of rafts that held\n> captives. Grouped in lots behind barricades, the sullen prisoners were\n> dressed in drab, identical uniforms, many of which fit badly. The\n> slaves were lean and angular, as if unaccustomed to eating regular\n> meals. These men and women came from planets that few of the free\n> citizens of Poritrin had ever heard of, much less visited.\n>\n> Their handlers seemed aloof, not particularly eager to show off wares\n> or haggle over prices. After the recent plague, many households and\n> estates needed to replace their personnel, and it was a\n> sellers'market.\n>\n> Other customers crowded against the railings, scrutinizing the\n> downcast faces, inspecting the merchandise. One old man clutching a\n> wad of credits\n>\n> summoned the tender and asked for a closer look at four middle-aged\n> females.\n>\n> Holtzman was not particularly picky, nor did he want to waste time.\n>\n> Since he needed so many slaves, he intended to buy an entire lot. Once\n> they arrived at his blufftop estate, he would choose the most\n> intelligent ones to work calculations, while the remainder would cook,\n> clean, or maintain his household.\n>\n> He hated these menial shopping duties, but had never delegated them in\n> the past. He smiled, realizing he had been critical of Norma for doing\n> the very same thing, for her failure to use solvers.\n>\n> Impatient and eager, Holtzman summoned the nearest handler, waving\n> Niko Bludd's credit authorization and pushing himself to the front. \"I\n> want a large order of slaves.\"\n>\n> The Human Resources merchant bustled over, grinning and bowing. \"Of\n> course, Savant Holtzman! What you require, I shall provide. Simply\n> specify your needs, and I will provide a competitive quotation.\"\n>\n> Suspicious that the merchant might try to cheat him, he said, \"I need\n> slaves that are smart and independent, but capable of following\n> instructions. Seventy or eighty will do, I suppose.\" Some of the\n> customers pushing close to the railing grumbled, but did not challenge\n> the celebrity inventor.\n>\n> \"Quite a demand,\" the vendor said, \"especially in these lean times.\n> The plague has created a shortage, until the Tlulaxa flesh merchants\n> deliver more.\"\n>\n> \"Everyone knows how important--- and *essential*--- my work is,\"\n> Holtzman said, pointedly removing a chronometer from the wide sleeve\n> of his white robe. \"My needs take precedence over some rich citizen\n> looking to replace a house cleaner. If you like, I will obtain a\n> special dispensation from Lord Bludd.\"\n>\n> \"I know you can do that, Savant,\" said the slave tender. He shouted at\n> the other customers pushing forward. \"All of you, quit your\n> complaining! Without this man, we'd be sweeping the floors for\n> thinking machines right now!\" Putting on another face, the handler\n> smiled back at Holtzman. \"The question, of course, is which slaves\n> would best serve you? I have a new batch just delivered from\n> Harmonthep: Zensunnis, all of them. Suitably docile, but I'm afraid\n> they go for a premium.\"\n>\n> Holtzman frowned. He preferred to use his finances in other ways,\n> especially considering the large investment that would be necessary\n> for his new alloy-resonator concept. \"Do not attempt to take advantage\n> of me, sir.\"\n>\n> The man reddened, but held his ground, sensing that the inventor was\n> in a hurry. \"Perhaps another group would be more suitable then? I have\n> some just in from IV Anbus.\" He gestured to a separate raft where\n> dark-haired slaves stared out with hostile expressions, challenging\n> the customers. \"They are Zenshiites.\"\n>\n> \"What's the difference? Are they less expensive?\"\n>\n> \"A simple matter of religious philosophy.\" The slave merchant waited\n> for some recognition, didn't see it, then smiled with relief. \"Who can\n> understand the Buddislamics, anyway? They're workers, and that's what\n> you need, right? I can sell you these Zenshiites for a lower price,\n> even though they're quite intelligent. Probably better educated than\n> the Harmonthep lot. They're healthy, too. I have medical\n> certifications. Not one of them has been exposed to the plague virus.\"\n>\n> Holtzman perused the group. They all had rolled up their left sleeves,\n> as if it were some kind of badge. Up front, a muscular man with fiery\n> eyes and a thick black beard gazed back at him dispassionately, as if\n> he considered himself superior to those who held him captive.\n>\n> With his cursory inspection, Holtzman could see nothing wrong with the\n> IV Anbus captives. His household was desperately understaffed, and his\n> laboratories needed more low-level technicians. Every day it was a\n> struggle\n>\n> to find enough solvers to work through the increasingly complex sets\n> of equations.\n>\n> \"But why are they cheaper?\" he persisted.\n>\n> \"They are more plentiful. It's a simple matter of supply and demand.\"\n> The slave vendor held his gaze. He named a price.\n>\n> Too impatient to haggle for the best deal, Holtzman nodded. \"I'll take\n> eighty of them.\" He raised his voice. \"I don't care if they're from IV\n> Anbus or Harmonthep. They're on Poritrin now, and they work for Savant\n> Tio Holtzman.\"\n>\n> The crafty slave merchant turned to the group of captives and shouted.\n> \"You hear that? You should be proud.\"\n>\n> The dark-haired captives simply looked back at their new master,\n> saying nothing. Holtzman was relieved. That probably meant they would\n> be more tractable.\n>\n> He transferred the correct amount of credits. \"See that they are\n> cleaned up and sent to my residence.\"\n>\n> The grinning slave handler thanked him profusely. \"Don't you worry,\n> Savant Holtzman. You'll be satisfied with this lot.\"\n>\n> As the great man left the crowded river market, other customers began\n> to shout and wave their credit vouchers, squabbling over the remaining\n> slaves. It promised to be a furious day of bidding.\n\n*Over the course of history, the stronger species invariably wins.*\n\n--- TLALOC,\n\n*A Time for Titans*\n\n> **A**fter taking refuge in the Arrakis wasteland, the Zensunni\n> Wanderers were little more than scavengers, and not very brave. Even\n> on their most distant excursions to collect useful items, the nomads\n> remained close to the rocks, avoiding the deep desert and the demon\n> worms.\n>\n> Long ago, after the Imperial chemist Shakkad the Wise had remarked on\n> the rejuvenating properties of the obscure spice melange, there had\n> been a small market for the natural substance among offworlders at the\n> Arrakis City spaceport. However, the planet's distance from popular\n> spacing lanes had never made melange an economically attractive item.\n> \"An oddity, not a commodity,\" one surly merchant had told Naib\n> Dhartha. Still, spice was a staple in the food supply, and it must be\n> gathered . . . but only on sands close to the rocks.\n>\n> Dhartha led a party of six across a ridge of packed powder sand that\n> held their footprints as if they were kisses in the dust. Loose white\n> cloths around their heads and faces exposed only their eyes; their\n> cloaks blew in the breeze, revealing equipment belts, tools, and\n> weapons. Dhartha snugged the cloth higher over his nose to keep from\n> breathing grit. He scratched the tattoo etched so painstakingly onto\n> his cheek, then narrowed his eyes, always alert for danger.\n>\n> No one thought to watch the clear morning skies until they heard a\n> faint whistle growing quickly into a howl. To Naib Dhartha, it sounded\n> like a woman who had just learned of her husband's death.\n>\n> Looking up, he saw a silvery bullet that tore through the atmosphere,\n> then recognized the unexpected hum and whine of thrusters. A\n> bubble-shaped object plummeted through the sky, spun about and\n> see-sawed in the open air as if choosing a place to land. Quad engines\n> slowed its descent. Then, less\n>\n> than a kilometer from where the scavenging party stood, the object\n> slammed into the dunes like a fist thumping into the stomach of a\n> dishonest merchant. A spray of dust and sand shot upward, embracing a\n> tendril of dark soot.\n>\n> The Naib stood stiffly and stared, while his men began to jabber\n> excitedly. Young Ebrahim was as enthralled as Dhartha's own son,\n> Mahmad; both boys wanted to race out and investigate.\n>\n> Mahmad was a good lad, respectful and cautious. But Dhartha had a low\n> opinion of Ebrahim, who liked to tell stories and talk of imaginary\n> exploits. Then there was the incident in which tribal water had been\n> stolen, an unforgivable crime. Initially the Naib had thought two boys\n> were involved, Ebrahim and Selim. But Ebrahim had been quick to\n> disavow any responsibility and to point the finger at the other boy.\n> Selim had seemed shocked at the accusation, but had not denied it.\n>\n> In addition, Ebrahim's father had stepped forward to make a generous\n> deal with Dhartha to save his son . . . and so the orphan boy had\n> received the ultimate sentence of banishment. Not much of a loss to\n> the tribe. A Naib often had to make such difficult decisions.\n>\n> Now, as the scavengers looked at Dhartha, their bright eyes glinting\n> between folds of dirty white cloth, he knew he could not ignore the\n> opportunity of this crashed ship, whatever it was. \"We must go see\n> this thing,\" he called.\n>\n> His men rushed across the sands, boisterous Ebrahim and Mahmad in the\n> lead, hurrying toward the pillar of dust that marked the impact.\n> Dhartha did not like to stray far from the sheltering rock, but the\n> desert beckoned them toward a rich, alien treasure.\n>\n> The nomads crested one dune, slid down the slipface, and scurried up\n> another. By the time they reached the impact crater, they were all\n> winded, panting hot breaths that were smothered by the cloths over\n> their mouths. The Naib and his men stood on the high lip of excavated\n> sand. Glassy smears of superheated silica had splattered like saliva\n> on the ground.\n>\n> Inside the pit lay a mechanical object the size of two men, with\n> protrusions and components that hummed and moved, awakening now that\n> it had landed. The carbon fiber-encased body still smoked from the\n> heat of reentry. A spacecraft, perhaps?\n>\n> One of Dhartha's men stepped back, making a warding sign with his\n> fingers. Overzealous Ebrahim, though, bent forward. The Naib put a\n> hand on Mahmad's left arm, cautioning his son. Let the foolish one\n> take the risks.\n>\n> The crashed pod was too small to carry passengers. The lights blinked\n> brighter, and the probe's sides opened like dragon wings to expose\n> mechanical limbs, articulated claws, and complex machinery inside.\n> Scanners, processors, engines of investigation and destruction.\n> Mirrorlike power converters spread out in the glare of the sun.\n>\n> Ebrahim slid down the churned sand at the edge of the pit. \"Imagine\n> what this would be worth at the spaceport, Naib! If I get to it first,\n> I should receive the largest salvage share.\"\n>\n> Dhartha wanted to argue with the exuberant youth, but when he saw that\n> no one--- except for his own son--- looked eager to join Ebrahim, he\n> nodded. \"If successful, you'll get an extra share.\" Even if the\n> falling object was completely ruined, the nomads could work the pure\n> metal for their own purposes.\n>\n> The brash young man stopped halfway down the loose slope, looking\n> suspiciously at the device, which continued to vibrate and thump.\n> Flexible components extruded arms and legs, while strange lenses and\n> mirrors rotated at the ends of flexible carbon fiber tentacles. The\n> probe seemed to be assessing its surroundings, as if it didn't\n> comprehend where it had landed.\n>\n> The machine paid no attention to the surreptitious humans, until\n> Ebrahim dug a stone from the slumping side of the crater. He called\n> out \"Ai! Ai!\" then hurled the rock. It struck the composite material\n> of the probe's side with an echoing *clunk*.\n>\n> The mechanical lander froze, then turned its lenses and scanners\n> toward the human standing all alone. Ebrahim hunched on bent knees in\n> the yielding sand.\n>\n> Blinding hot light erupted from one of the lenses. A gout of coherent\n> fire engulfed Ebrahim and blew him backward in a crackling cloud of\n> incinerated flesh and bones. A wad of smoldering garments struck the\n> top of the crater, along with charred pieces of his hands and feet.\n>\n> Mahmad screamed for his friend, and Dhartha immediately yelled for the\n> men to retreat. They stumbled back down the outside of the crater and\n> fled through the soft gully between dunes. Half a kilometer away,\n> safe, they climbed to a sandy crest high enough that they could look\n> back toward the pit. The men prayed and made superstitious gestures,\n> and Dhartha raised his clenched right fist. Foolish Ebrahim had drawn\n> the attention of the mechanical thing and had paid with his life.\n>\n> From a distance, the would-be scavengers watched. The crashed probe\n> paid them no further heed. Instead, with thumping and clattering, the\n> machine seemed to be assembling itself, building structures around its\n> core. Scooping hands drew sand into a resource-production hopper in\n> its belly and extruded glasslike rods that it used for structural\n> supports. The machine added new components, building itself larger,\n> and finally began digging its way out of the pit. It pounded and\n> hammered, making a great deal of racket.\n>\n> Dhartha remained perplexed. Though he was a leader, he had no idea\n> what to do. Such a thing was beyond his ken. Perhaps someone at the\n> spaceport would know, but he hated to rely on outworlders. Besides,\n> this thing might be valuable, and he didn't want to surrender his\n> salvage.\n>\n> \"Father, look.\" Mahmad gestured toward the wasteland of sand. \"See,\n> that machine demon will pay for killing my friend.\"\n>\n> Dhartha saw the telltale ripple, the stirring of a behemoth beneath\n> the sands. The crashed probe continued its pounding, rhythmic motion\n> with a clattering of components, oblivious to its surroundings. The\n> assembled mechanism raised itself, a monstrous composite of\n> crystalline materials and\n>\n> silica struts reinforced by carbon-fiber beams converted from its own\n> hull and support girders.\n>\n> The sandworm came in fast, tunneling just beneath the surface until\n> its head rose up. The mouth was a huge shovel larger than the impact\n> crater.\n>\n> The robotic probe waved its sensor arms and weapons lenses, sensing it\n> was being attacked, but not understanding how. Several white-hot\n> blasts of fire penetrated the loose ground.\n>\n> The worm swallowed the mechanical demon whole. Then the sinuous desert\n> creature burrowed beneath the dust again like a sea serpent seeking\n> deeper waters. . . .\n>\n> Naib Dhartha and his men remained petrified on the dunes. If they\n> turned and ran now, their vibrations would call the sandworm back for\n> another meal.\n>\n> Soon enough, they saw the worm trail heading outward, returning to the\n> deep desert. The crater was gone, along with all evidence of the\n> mechanical construction. Not even a scrap of foolish Ebrahim's body\n> remained.\n>\n> Shaking his head with its long black ponytail, Dhartha turned to his\n> shocked companions. \"This will make a legendary story, a magnificent\n> ballad to be sung in our caves in the dark of night. . . .\" He drew a\n> deepbreath and turned around. \"Though I doubt anyone will ever believe\n> us.\"\n>\n> *The future? I hate it because I will not be there.*\n\n--- JUNO,\n\n*Lives of the Titans*\n\n> **A**fter the unexpected encounter with the League Armada at Giedi\n> Prime, the battered *Dream Voyager* took an extra month to limp back\n> to Earth for repairs. Because of the slow pace caused by the damage,\n> Seurat had immediately dispatched his emergency buoy, relaying to\n> Omnius the dire news of the fall of the newest Synchronized World and\n> the loss of the Titan Barbarossa. By now the evermind must know what\n> had happened.\n>\n> The robot captain did his best to repair or bypass the ship's damaged\n> systems and seal off sections to protect his fragile human copilot.\n> General Agamemnon would not be pleased if his biological son were\n> injured. Besides, Seurat had developed a certain fondness for Vorian\n> Atreides. . . .\n>\n> Vor insisted on donning an environment suit and crawling outside the\n> update ship to inspect the hull. Seurat tethered him with two lines,\n> while three inspector drones accompanied him. When the young man saw\n> the blackened wound where the rebellious humans had fired upon them,\n> he once again felt a sense of shame. Intent only on delivering the\n> vital Omnius updates, Seurat had committed no aggressive act against\n> these *hrethgir*, yet they had attacked him. Wild humans were without\n> honor.\n>\n> Agamemnon and his friend Barbarossa had brought the unruly populace of\n> Giedi Prime into the sweeping embrace of Omnius, yet the *hrethgir*\n> had spurned the greater civilization of the Synchronized Worlds,\n> making a martyr of Barbarossa in the process. His father would be\n> deeply disturbed at the loss of such a close friend, one of the last\n> remaining Titans.\n>\n> Vor himself could have been killed, his soft and breakable human form\n> destroyed without ever having the chance to become a neo-cymek. A\n> single blow from the Armada could have erased all of Vor's potential,\n> all of his future work. He could not update himself or back up his\n> memories and\n>\n> experiences, as a machine could. He'd be lost, just like the Giedi\n> Prime-- Omnius. Just like the other twelve sons of Agamemnon. The\n> thought sickened him, and he shuddered.\n>\n> On their return journey, Seurat tried to cheer Vor with ridiculous\n> jokes, as if nothing had happened. The robot commended his companion\n> for quick thinking and tactical innovation in outwitting the\n> *hrethgir* officer. Vor's deceit in pretending to be a rebellious\n> human who had captured a thinking-machine vessel--- what an outr\u00e9\n> scenario!--- had given them a few moments of valuable time, and his\n> decoy projections had allowed them to escape. Perhaps it would even be\n> taught to others in the trustee schools on Earth.\n>\n> Vor, however, cared most about what his father might say. The approval\n> of the great Agamemnon would make everything all right.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WHEN THE *DREAM VOYAGER* landed at Earth's central spaceport, Vorian\n> hurried down the ramp, eyes alert, face eager--- then crestfallen when\n> he saw no sign of the Titan general.\n>\n> Vor swallowed hard. Unless vital matters intervened, his father always\n> came to greet him. These were rare moments they had together, when\n> they could exchange ideas, talk about plans and dreams. Vor comforted\n> himself with the thought that Agamemnon probably had important\n> business for Omnius.\n>\n> Robotic maintenance crews and repair machinery trundled forward to\n> inspect the damaged ship. One of the multicomponent machines paused in\n> its assessment, broke away, and hummed toward him. \"Vorian Atreides,\n> Agamemnon has commanded you to meet him in the conditioning facility.\n> Report there immediately.\"\n>\n> The young human brightened. Letting the robot return to its work, he\n> walked off briskly. When he could contain himself no longer, he began\n> to run. . . .\n>\n> Though he attempted to exercise during the long voyages with Seurat,\n> Vor's biological muscles were weaker than a machine's, and he tired\n> quickly. Another reminder of his mortality, his fragility, and the\n> inferiority of natural biology. It only increased his desire to wear a\n> powerful neo-cymek body someday and discard this imperfect human form.\n>\n> His lungs burning, Vor rushed into the gleaming chrome-and-plaz\n> chamber where his father's brain canister was regularly polished and\n> recharged with electrafluid. As soon as the young man entered the\n> cold, well-lit room, two robot guards folded in behind him, ominously\n> blocking egress. In the center of the chamber stood a mechanical,\n> human-shaped colossus that Agamemnon now wore. The behemoth took two\n> steps forward, stabilizer-feet hammering against the hard floor. He\n> dwarfed his son, towering three times Vorian's height.\n>\n> \"I have been waiting for you, my son. Everything is prepared. What\n> caused your delay?\"\n>\n> Intimidated, Vor looked up at the preservation canister. \"I hurried\n> here, Father. My ship landed only an hour ago.\"\n>\n> \"I understand the *Dream Voyager* was damaged at Giedi Prime, attacked\n> by the human rebels that murdered Barbarossa and recaptured the\n> world.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, sir.\" Vor knew better than to waste the Titan's time with\n> unnecessary details. The general would already have received a full\n> report. \"I will answer any questions you might have, Father.\"\n>\n> \"I have no questions, only *commands*.\" Instead of instructing his son\n> to begin the process of grooming and polishing his components,\n> Agamemnon raised a gauntleted hand, clutched Vorian by the chest, and\n> pushed him forcefully against an upright table.\n>\n> Vor was slammed against the smooth surface and felt a burst of pain.\n> His father was so powerful that he could accidentally break bones,\n> sever the spine. \"What is it, Father? What---\"\n>\n> Holding him immobile, Agamemnon clamped on wrist bindings, a waist\n> restraint, and ankle cuffs. Helpless now, Vor twisted his head to look\n> at what his father was doing and saw that complex devices had been\n> brought into the chamber. With trepidation he noted hollow cylinders\n> filled with bluish fluids, neuromechanical pumps, and chittering\n> machines that waved questing sensor tips in the air.\n>\n> \"Please, Father.\" Vor's deepest fears careened through his mind,\n> ricocheting off the pain, each impact increasing his doubts and\n> terrors. \"What have I done wrong?\"\n>\n> Showing no readable expression on his head turret, Agamemnon extended\n> an array of long needles toward his son's squirming body. The steel\n> points penetrated his chest, poking between his ribs, seeking out and\n> finding his lungs, his heart. Two silver shafts pierced his throat.\n> Blood oozed out everywhere. Vor's neck sinews bulged as he clenched\n> his jaw and curled back his lips, biting back a scream.\n>\n> But the scream broke through anyway.\n>\n> The cymek manipulated the machinery connected to Vorian's body,\n> increasing the pain beyond all imaginable levels. Convinced that he\n> had failed somehow, Vor assumed it was his time to die--- like the\n> twelve unknown brothers who had preceded him. Now, it seemed, Vorian\n> had not lived up to Agamemnon's expectations.\n>\n> Agony swelled higher, with no crest in sight. His scream became a\n> prolonged wail, as acid-colored fluids were pumped into his body. Soon\n> even his vocal cords gave out, and his shriek continued only in his\n> mind . . .\n>\n> yet it continued nevertheless. He could endure no more. He could not\n> imagine the grievous injury his stretched and torn body must already\n> have endured.\n>\n> When finally the torture concluded and Vor came back to himself, he\n> didn't know how long he had been unconscious--- perhaps even lost in\n> the cloak of death. His body felt as if it had been crushed into a\n> ball and then stretched back into the form of a man.\n>\n> The colossus shape of Agamemnon loomed over him, a galaxy of optic\n> threads glittering on his body. Even though the remnants of\n> excruciating pain echoed inside his skull, Vor resisted crying out.\n> His father had kept him alive after all, for his own reasons. He\n> stared into the Titan's implacable metal face and could only hope that\n> his father had not revived him just to inflict more agony.\n>\n> *What have I done wrong?*\n>\n> Yet the ancient cymek did not have murder on his mind. Instead he\n> said, \"I am exceedingly pleased with your actions aboard the *Dream\n> Voyager*, Vorian. I have analyzed Seurat's report and determined that\n> your tactical prowess in escaping from the League Armada was\n> innovative and unexpected.\"\n>\n> Vorian couldn't understand the context of his father's words. They\n> seemed unrelated to the tortures the general had inflicted on him.\n>\n> \"No thinking machine would have considered such a deceitful trick. I\n> doubt even another trustee would have been so quick to think of the\n> ruse. In fact, Omnius's summation concludes that any other action\n> would likely have resulted in the capture or destruction of the *Dream\n> Voyager*. Seurat would never have been capable of surviving by\n> himself. You not only saved the ship, you saved the Omnius update\n> spheres and returned them intact.\" Agamemnon paused, then reiterated.\n> \"Yes, I am exceedingly pleased, my son. You have the potential of\n> becoming a great cymek someday.\"\n>\n> Vor's raw throat convulsed as he tried to force out words. The\n> needle-studded cradle had been yanked away, and now Agamemnon released\n> the body restraints that held him against the hard surface. Vorian's\n> watery muscles could not support him, and he drooped like a rag,\n> sliding down until he pooled on his knees on the floor. Finally he\n> choked, \"Then why was I tortured? Why have you punished me?\"\n>\n> Agamemnon simulated a laugh. \"When I choose to punish you, son, you\n> will know. That was a *reward*. Omnius allowed me to grant you this\n> rare\n>\n> gift. In fact, no other human in all the Synchronized Worlds has been\n> so honored.\"\n>\n> \"But how, Father? Please explain it to me. My mind is still\n> throbbing.\" His voice hitched.\n>\n> \"What are a few moments of pain, in comparison with the gift you have\n> received?\" The colossus paced back and forth across the sparkling\n> maintenance room, shaking the floor and the walls. \"Unfortunately, I\n> was unable to convince Omnius to convert you into a neo-cymek--- you\n> are too young--- but I am sure the time will come. I wanted you to\n> serve at my side\n>\n> --- more than a trustee, but as my true successor.\" His sparkling\n> optic threads glowed brighter. \"Instead, I have done the next best\n> thing for you.\"\n>\n> The cymek general explained that he had given Vorian a rigorous\n> biotech treatment, a cellular replacement system that would\n> dramatically extend his life as a human. \"Geriatric specialists\n> developed the technique in the Old Empire . . . though to what purpose\n> I cannot fathom. Those oafs did nothing productive during their normal\n> lifespans, so why should they want to live for centuries longer and\n> accomplish even less? Through new proteins, rejection of free\n> radicals, more efficient cellular repair mechanisms, they prolonged\n> their pointless existences. Most of them were murdered in the\n> rebellions when we Titans cemented our control.\"\n>\n> Agamemnon swiveled at his torso joint. \"While we still wore human\n> bodies at the beginning of our rule, all twenty Titans underwent the\n> biotech life extension, just like you, so I am quite familiar with the\n> level of pain you endured. We *needed* to live for centuries, because\n> we required that much time to reassert vision and competent leadership\n> upon the waning Old Empire. Even after we converted ourselves into\n> cymeks, the process helped prevent our ancient biological brains from\n> degenerating because of our extreme age.\"\n>\n> His mechanical body strode closer. \"This life-extension process is our\n> little secret, Vorian. The League of Nobles would tear themselves into\n> a frenzy if they knew we had such technology.\" Agamemnon made a\n> wistful sound,\n>\n> almost a sigh. \"But beware, my son: Even such enhancements cannot\n> protect you against accidents or outright assassination attempts. As,\n> unfortunately, Barbarossa recently discovered.\"\n>\n> Vor finally struggled shakily to his feet. He located a water\n> dispenser, gulped a beaker of cool liquid, and felt his heartbeat\n> slowing.\n>\n> \"Astonishing events await you, my son. Your life is no longer a candle\n> in the wind. You have time to experience many things, important\n> things.\"\n>\n> The hulking cymek stalked over to a harness and used an intricate\n> network of artificial hands and clamps extruded from the metal wall to\n> link to the thoughtrodes of his brain canister. Flexible lifting arms\n> raised the cylinder out of the colossus body core and shuttled it over\n> to one of the chrome pedestals.\n>\n> \"Now you are one step closer to your potential, Vorian,\" Agamemnon\n> said through a wall speaker, detached from the mobile body.\n>\n> Though weak and still in pain, Vor knew what his father expected of\n> him now. He hurried to the conditioning devices and with trembling\n> hands attached power cables to the magsockets of the translucent brain\n> chamber. The bluish electrafluid seemed full of mental energy.\n>\n> Trying to restore a sense of normalcy amid the clamoring disbelief at\n> what had just happened to him, Vor went through his habitual grooming\n> duties, tending his father's mechanical systems. Lovingly, the young\n> man gazed at the wrinkled mass of brain, the ancient mind so full of\n> profound ideas and difficult decisions, as expressed in the general's\n> extensive memoirs. Each time he read them, Vor hoped to understand his\n> complex father better.\n>\n> He wondered if Agamemnon had kept him in the dark to play a cruel joke\n> on him, or to challenge his resolve. Vor would always accept whatever\n> the cymek general commanded, would never try to flee. Now that the\n> agony was over, he hoped he had passed whatever test his father had\n> administered.\n>\n> As Vor continued the patient grooming of the preservation tank,\n> Agamemnon spoke softly, a susurration. \"You are very quiet, my son.\n> What do you think about the great gift you have received?\"\n>\n> The young man paused a moment, not certain how to respond. Agamemnon\n> was often impulsive and difficult to understand, but he rarely acted\n> without a larger purpose in mind. Vor could only hope to comprehend\n> the overall picture someday, the grand tapestry.\n>\n> \"Thank you, Father,\" he finally said, \"for giving me more time to\n> accomplish everything you want me to do.\"\n>\n> *Why do humans spend so much time worrying about what they call \"moral\n> issues\"? It is one of the many mysteries of their behavior.*\n\n--- ERASMUS,\n\n*Reflections on Sentient Biologicals*\n\n> **T**he identical twin girls looked peaceful and asleep, side by side,\n> like little angels in a cozy bed.

It\n> especially intrigued Erasmus to see what happened when he conducted\n> \"panic experiments\" on crowds of them in the breeding pens, wading in\n> and butchering some while letting others survive. In such\n> circumstances of extreme stress, leaders invariably emerged, people\n> who behaved with more inner strength than the others. Erasmus\n> especially liked to kill those individuals and then watch the\n> devastating effect it had on the rest of the people.\n>\n> Perhaps his sample group of experimental subjects over the centuries\n> was too small. He might need to vivisect and dissect tens of thousands\n> more before he could draw meaningful conclusions.

A wasted opportunity.\n>\n> \"Analyzing docile slaves gives you irrelevant results, Erasmus. All\n> thoughts of revolt have been bred out of them. Therefore, any\n> information you derive is of questionable applicability for military\n> purposes.\" The evermind's voice boomed from the wallscreen.\n>\n> Erasmus soaked his organic-plastic hands in solvent to eliminate the\n> drying blood.

Many self-proclaimed \"experts\" offered\n> wildly disparate answers.\n>\n> On the table, the surviving twin continued to mewl her pain and fear.\n> \"I disagree, Omnius.

It is a fundamental flaw in their biological\n> programming. Would that not be useful information?\"\n>\n> \"Yes.

Holtzman\n> had acquired a new group of Zenshiite workers from Poritrin's \"Human\n> Resources\"\n>\n> quarter, but those replacements were not yet sufficiently trained for\n> higher-order mathematics.\n>\n> After handing her new problem to the lead solver, Norma explained\n> patiently what she wanted the slaves to do, how she had already done\n> some of the setup for them. She encouraged the hardworking solvers in\n> the direction she wanted them to take, emphasizing the importance of\n> her theory--- until she looked up to see Holtzman himself in the\n> doorway.\n>\n> Frowning, he drew Norma down the hall. \"You are wasting time trying to\n> befriend them. Remember, the solver-slaves are just organic equipment,\n> processors providing a result. They are replaceable, so don't give\n> them personalities or temperaments. Only the solutions matter to us.\n> An equation has no personality.\"\n>\n> Norma chose not to argue, but went back to her rooms to continue her\n> efforts alone. It seemed to her that the more esoteric orders of\n> mathematics did indeed have personalities, that certain theorems and\n> integrals required finesse and considerations that simple arithmetic\n> never demanded.\n>\n> Pacing, she wandered around to the back of the crystal slate, where\n> she peered at the reverse of her equations. The backward symbols\n> looked like nonsense, yet she forced herself to stare at the question\n> from a different perspective. Earlier, the solvers had finished the\n> previous set of tedious calculations, and while she had checked their\n> work, the result still perplexed her.\n>\n> Knowing in her heart what the answer must be, she disregarded the\n> slaves' result and returned to the front of the erasable crystal,\n> where she scribbled so furiously that silvery numbers and symbols soon\n> flowed across the hanging plate. Afterward she went frontside to back,\n> trying to discover an exit from her quandary.\n>\n> Tio Holtzman jarred Norma out of a theoretical universe. He looked at\n> her in surprise. \"You were in a trance.\"\n>\n> \"I was thinking,\" she said.\n>\n> Holtzman chuckled. \"On the wrong side of the slate?\" \"It opened new\n> possibilities for me.\"\n>\n> He rubbed his chin, where gray beard stubble protruded. \"I've never\n> seen anyone concentrate as hard as you do.\"\n>\n> In her mind she circled the solution she had developed, but could not\n> put it into words. \"I know what the result *should* be, but I cannot\n> reproduce it for you. The solvers keep coming up with a different\n> answer than I expect.\"\n>\n> \"Did they make an error?\" He looked angry.\n>\n> \"Not that I can determine. Their work seems to be correct.\n> Nonetheless, I feel that it is . . . wrong.\"\n>\n> The scientist frowned. \"Mathematics doesn't exist to fulfill wishes,\n> Norma. You must go through the steps and abide by the laws of the\n> universe.\"\n>\n> \"You mean the *known* laws of the universe, Savant. I simply wish to\n> extend our thinking, stretch it and fold it back in on itself. I'm\n> certain there are ways around the problem. Intuitive loopholes.\"\n>\n> His expression seemed patronizing, perplexed but disbelieving. \"The\n> mathematical theories we work with are often esoteric and difficult to\n> grasp, but they always follow certain rules.\"\n>\n> She turned, frustrated that he continued to doubt her. \"Blind\n> adherence to rules allowed the creation of the thinking machines in\n> the first place. Following the rules may prevent us from defeating our\n> enemies. You said it yourself, Savant. We must look for alternatives.\"\n>\n> Seizing a subject that interested him at last, he clasped his hands\n> together, long sleeves draped over his knuckles. \"Indeed, Norma! I\n> have completed my design work on the alloy-resonance generator, and\n> the prototype is next.\"\n>\n> Too preoccupied to be tactful with him, she shook her head. \"Your\n> alloy-resonance generator won't work. I have studied your early\n> designs exhaustively. I think it is fundamentally flawed.\"\n>\n> Holtzman looked as if she had reached up and slapped him. \"I beg your\n> pardon? I have been through all the work. The solvers have checked\n> every step.\"\n>\n> Distracted by her equation-filled crystal slate, she shrugged.\n> \"Nevertheless, Savant, it is my opinion that your concept is not\n> viable. Correct calculations are not always correct--- if based on\n> faulty principles or invalid assumptions.\" Furrows formed on her brow\n> as she finally noticed his crestfallen reaction. \"Why are you upset?\n> You told me the purpose of science is to try ideas and dismiss them\n> when they don't work.\"\n>\n> \"Your objection has yet to be proven,\" he said, his voice brittle.\n> \"Show me in my designs where I have made an error, please.\"\n>\n> \"It's not so much an error as . . .\" She shook her head. \"It's an\n> intuition.\" \"I don't trust intuition,\" he said.\n>\n> Disappointed by his attitude, she drew a deep breath. Zufa Cenva had\n> never adhered to any graceful social skills, and Norma had developed\n> few of her own. She had grown up isolated on Rossak and been dismissed\n> by most of those who knew her--- with the exception of Aurelius\n> Venport.\n>\n> Holtzman seemed to have an agenda beyond what he preached. But he was\n> a scientist, after all, and she felt they had been brought together\n> for an important purpose. It was her duty to point out when she felt\n> he was making an error. He would have done the same for her. \"I still\n> think you shouldn't devote any further time or resources to the\n> resonance-generator project.\"\n>\n> \"Since the resources are mine to distribute as I see fit,\" Holtzman\n> said in a huff, \"I will continue, and hope to prove you wrong.\" He\n> left her chamber, grumbling.\n>\n> She called after him in an attempt to ease the situation. \"Believe me,\n> Savant, I hope you prove me wrong.\"\n>\n> *There is a certain malevolence about the formation of social orders,\n> a profound struggle, with despotism on one end and slavery on the\n> other.*\n\n--- TLALOC,\n\n*Weaknesses of the Empire*\n\n> **P**oritrin's river delta was not at all like Harmonthep's gentle\n> rivulets and marshes.

Crew master Iblis Ginjo perused the daily tally and\n> production requirements on his electronic notepad. He had made his\n> slaves understand their very real danger, should the brutal cymek lose\n> patience. They worked very hard, not just for fear of their lives, but\n> because Iblis had inspired them.\n>\n> Then, a disaster occurred on another part of the project.\n>\n> With the heat of day rising around the observation scaffold where\n> Iblis stood supervising the stabilization of the sturdy pedestal, in\n> the distance he saw the top of the nearly completed Ajax statue begin\n> to move. The iron, polymer, and stone colossus tottered one way and\n> then the other, as if gravity itself were shaking the enormous work of\n> art.\n>\n> Suddenly the giant monument toppled with a crashing roar, accompanied\n> by distant shouts and screams. As a cloud of dust climbed into the\n> sky, Iblis knew that any slave who had been crushed under the massive\n> statue should be considered lucky.\n>\n> Once Ajax learned of the catastrophe, the real mayhem would begin.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> EVEN BEFORE THE dust and rubble settled, Iblis rushed into the furious\n> debate among neo-cymeks and his fellow trustee crew leaders. It hadn't\n> been his part of the monument project that had collapsed, but his\n> teams would suffer in the inevitable delays caused by the accident.\n> Still, Iblis hoped his charismatic mediation skills could help\n> mitigate the disaster.\n>\n> Enraged neo-cymeks saw the clumsy damage as a personal affront to\n> their revered Titan predecessors. Ajax himself had already torn a work\n> supervisor limb from limb, and gory body parts lay scattered and\n> dripping in the dust.\n>\n> With all the compelling passion he could summon, Iblis Ginjo made the\n> angry neo-cymeks pause. \"Wait, wait! This can be fixed, if you will\n> allow me!\"\n>\n> Ajax rose taller, more threatening than any of the neo-cymeks, but\n> Iblis continued, his words silky. \"True, the enormous statue has\n> suffered some harm, but nothing more than superficial blemishes. Lord\n> Ajax, this monument was designed to endure throughout the ages!\n> Certainly it can endure a few bumps and scratches. Your grand legacy\n> is not so easily bruised.\"\n>\n> He paused as the cymeks were forced to admit the truth of this. Then\n> he pointed toward his own work area and continued in a reasonable\n> tone, \"Look, my crews have nearly finished the sturdy pedestal\n> designed to hold up the statue. Why don't we erect it anyway, to show\n> the universe that we can brush aside minor annoyances like this\n> accident? My workers can perform all the necessary repairs in place.\"\n> Iblis's eyes shone with artificial enthusiasm. \"There is no reason for\n> further delay.\"\n>\n> Pacing about the carnage and confusion in his menacing armored body,\n> Ajax stomped on one of the crew leaders who was babbling his\n> innocence, pulping him into the ground. Then the angry Titan towered\n> over Iblis, optic threads glowing like white-hot stars. \"You have now\n> accepted responsibility to see that work continues according to\n> schedule. If your teams fail, the blame will be yours.\"\n>\n> \"Of course, Lord Ajax.\" Iblis showed no alarm at all. He could\n> convince the slaves to carry the burden. They would do it for him.\n>\n> \"Then get this mess cleaned up!\" Ajax thundered in a voice that could\n> be heard across the hilltop Forum.\n>\n> Later, Iblis made promises to his already-exhausted, overtaxed slaves.\n> They had been discontented and resistant for a while, but he won them\n> over with a stirring account of the wondrous benefits they would\n> receive: the finest sex slaves, incredible feasts, days of leisure to\n> journey about the countryside. \"I am not like other trustees. Have I\n> ever let you down? Ever promised a reward that I failed to deliver?\"\n>\n> With such an incentive, not to mention a healthy dose of fear for the\n> Titan Ajax, the laborers set to the task with redoubled energy. In the\n> coolness of the evening, with hovering spotlights glaring like\n> super-novas over the construction site, Iblis kept his crew working\n> efficiently. From his high wooden platform, he watched as the slaves\n> raised the immense statue on its sturdy reinforced pedestal and\n> plasma-bolted it into place.\n>\n> Artisans rushed forward and scaled the curved stone-and-iron surface\n> with climbing equipment, and set up swaying temporary scaffolds to\n> begin their restoration work. Ajax's legendary face had a marred nose\n> and one dented muscular arm, as well as deep gouges across the front\n> of the Titan uniform. In his secret heart, Iblis suspected the real\n> Ajax's human form had been lumpish and ugly.\n>\n> Throughout the long, tiresome night, Iblis struggled to stay awake,\n> leaning against the rail and peering into the blurring abyss. He dozed\n> off, then awoke, startled, as he heard the smooth hum of the lift\n> platform rising to his level.\n>\n> But he was mystified to see that the lift bore no one at all. Only a\n> small sheet of rolled-up metal, a message cylinder. Iblis stared, his\n> heart pounding, but the lift remained at his level, as if waiting. He\n> looked over the edge, but could not determine who had left the\n> message.\n>\n> *How could he ignore it?*\n>\n> Iblis stole forward and grabbed the scrap of scribed metal. He broke\n> the seal, unrolled the thin sheet, and read with increasing\n> astonishment.\n>\n> \"We represent an organized movement of dissatisfied humans. We are\n> waiting for the right moment and the right leader to begin an open\n> revolt against the oppressive machines. You must determine if you wish\n> to join our worthy cause. We will contact you again.\"\n>\n> As Iblis stared in disbelief at the unsigned message, the lettering\n> faded and disappeared, corroding into blobs of rust that ate through\n> the metal itself and flaked away.\n>\n> Was it authentic, or some sort of a cymek trap designed to lure him?\n> Most humans hated their machine masters, but took pains to conceal it.\n> *What if there really is such a group?* And if so, they would need\n> talented leaders.\n>\n> The thought exhilarated him. Iblis had never considered such an idea\n> before, and he couldn't imagine what he had said or done to reveal his\n> innermost thoughts and feelings. Why did they suspect? He had always\n> been respectful to his superiors, had always---\n>\n> *But have I been overly attentive? Have I tried too hard to appear\n> loyal?*\n>\n> On the towering Ajax statue, just below his own level, the artisans\n> remained hard at work like busy termites on a log. They repaired\n> scrape marks, expertly patched and painted the marred exterior. Dawn\n> broke across the monumental statue, and Iblis could see they would be\n> finished soon. The machines would reward him for his labors.\n>\n> How he hated them!\n>\n> Iblis wrestled with his conscience. The thinking machines had treated\n> him well in comparison with other slaves, but only a thin layer of\n> protection kept him from the same fate. In his private moments Iblis\n> often pondered the value of freedom, and what he could do if given the\n> chance.\n>\n> A rebel group? He could barely believe it. As days went by, Iblis\n> found himself thinking about it more and more . . . and waiting to be\n> contacted again.\n\n> *Our appetite encompasses everything.*\n\n--- COGITOR EKLO,\n\n*Beyond the Human Mind*\n\n> **W**ith all the hatred concealed inside his mind, Agamemnon took\n> special precautions wherever Omnius could spy on him.

Her nose had\n> been pointed, her face narrow, with eyebrows that arched in a\n> mysterious way. He always thought of her as Cleopatra, another\n> military genius from the mists of history, just like the first\n> Agamemnon in the Trojan War.\n>\n> Long ago, during the eyeblink of time when he had worn a frail human\n> physique, Agamemnon had fallen in love with this woman.

The two of\n> them had been teenagers then, back when age mattered.\n>\n> As a boy, Agamemnon had been raised on pampered Earth, with the name\n> of Andrew Skouros. His parents had led a hedonistic but passionless\n> lifestyle, as had so many other citizens. They existed, they dabbled .\n> . . but none of them really *lived*. Across the depths of time, he\n> barely remembered the faces of his parents. All weak and feeble humans\n> looked the same to him now.\n>\n> Andrew Skouros had always been restless. He had asked uncomfortable\n> questions that no one could answer. While the others played frivolous\n> parlor games, the young man dug into archival databases, where he\n> uncovered history and legends. He found heroic tales of real people\n> who had existed so long ago they seemed as mythical as the race of\n> Titans, the earliest gods overthrown by Zeus and a pantheon of Greek\n> deities. He analyzed military conquests and came to understand tactics\n> at a time when it was an obsolete skill in the peace-strangled Empire.\n>\n> Under the alias \"Agamemnon,\" he became interested in strategic games\n> played across the computer network that monitored the activities of\n> ennui-enslaved humanity. There he had encountered another person as\n> skilled and talented as himself, a rare soulmate who shared his\n> restless interests. The mysterious player's wild and unexpected ideas\n> caused her campaigns to fail as often as they succeeded--- but her\n> surprising successes more than made up for the spectacular failures.\n> Her intriguing alias was \"Juno,\" taken from the queen of the Roman\n> gods, wife of Jupiter.\n>\n> Drawn together by their common ambition, their relationship was fiery\n> and challenging, more than just sex. They pleasured themselves by\n> developing\n>\n> thought-experiments. It was a game at first . . . and then much more\n> than that.\n>\n> Their lives changed dramatically when they had heard Tlaloc speak.\n>\n> The offworld visionary, with his disturbing, chastising accusations\n> against complacent humanity on Earth, made the two young schemers\n> realize that their plans could blossom into more than just imaginative\n> adventures.\n>\n> Juno, whose real name was Julianna Parhi, had brought the three of\n> them together. She and Andrew Skouros arranged to speak with Tlaloc,\n> who was excited to learn that they shared his dreams. \"We may be few,\"\n> Tlaloc had said, \"but in Earth's forests full of deadwood, three\n> matches may be enough to spark a conflagration.\"\n>\n> Meeting secretly, the rebellious trio plotted to overthrow the\n> sleeping Empire. Using Andrew's military expertise, they saw that a\n> small investment of hardware and manpower could take over many worlds\n> that had fallen into apathetic stupor. With a little luck and\n> acceptable tactics, like-minded leaders could form an iron grip around\n> the Old Empire. In fact, if the plans were properly set in motion, the\n> conquerors could achieve victory before anyone even noticed.\n>\n> \"It is for humanity's own good,\" Tlaloc had said, his eyes sparkling.\n> \"And for ours,\" Juno added. \"Just a little.\"\n>\n> In one of her innovative plans, Juno utilized the pervasive network of\n> thinking machines and their servile robots. The docile computers had\n> been given artificial intelligence to watch over every aspect of human\n> society, but Julianna saw them as an invasion army already in place .\n> . . if only they could be reprogrammed, given a taste for conquest and\n> human ambition.

As cymeks, the Titans could live and rule\n> for thousands of years.\n>\n> Perhaps that would be long enough.\n>\n> Agamemnon had immediately agreed with Juno's concept, though he faced\n> a primitive fear of the surgery itself. He and Juno knew that as the\n> Titans experienced the dangers of the universe and the fragility of\n> their human bodies, they would all come around.\n>\n> To show faith in his lover, Agamemnon was the first to undergo the\n> cymek process. He and Juno had spent a last heated night together,\n> naked and touching, storing memories of nerve sensations that would\n> have to last for millennia. Juno had tossed her raven hair, given him\n> a final, tender kiss, and led him into the surgical chamber. There,\n> computerized medical apparatus, robotic surgeons, and dozens of\n> life-support systems waited for him.\n>\n> The Cogitor Eklo had observed and assisted, offering advice whenever\n> necessary, providing precise instructions for the robotic surgeons.\n> Juno had watched her lover, eyes misty as she witnessed the\n> transformation process. Agamemnon feared that she would become\n> squeamish after that and renege on her own plans. But once his brain\n> hung suspended in dynamic electrafluid, once the thoughtrodes were\n> activated and he could \"see\" again through a galaxy of optic threads,\n> Juno was there admiring him, studying the brain canister.\n>\n> She had touched his transparent case with her fingertips. Agamemnon\n> watched it all, focusing and adjusting his new and unfamiliar sensors,\n>\n> enthralled with the ability to observe everything at once.\n>\n> A week later, when he felt competent enough with his new mechanical\n> systems, Agamemnon had returned the favor, watching over Juno as the\n> robotic surgeons sawed open her skull and removed her talented brain,\n> discarding forever the fallible female body of Julianna Parhi. . . .\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> CENTURIES LATER, EVEN without biological bodies, he and Juno remained\n> side by side on their chrome pedestals, connected by receptors and\n> stimulus patches.\n>\n> Agamemnon knew precisely which parts of Juno's brain to pulse in order\n> to activate pleasure centers, and how long to maintain the\n> stimulation. She responded in kind, bringing forth his stored memories\n> of human lovemaking and then amplifying the remembered sensations,\n> stunning him with new heights of euphoria. He struck back with a bolt\n> of his own, causing her brain to quiver.\n>\n> Through it all, the information-gathering watcheyes of Omnius observed\n> intently, like a mechanized voyeur. Even in a time such as this,\n> Agamemnon and Juno were never alone.\n>\n> She pleasured him twice more, making his mind throb; he wanted her to\n> stop so that he could rest, but also longed for her to continue.\n> Agamemnon reciprocated, causing a thin, vibrating sound to pulse from\n> the speakers attached to the canisters, an eerie warbling music that\n> symbolized their merging orgasms. He could barely think through the\n> haze of delight.\n>\n> But his brooding anger continued in the background. Though Omnius\n> allowed him and Juno to have their ecstasy as often as they wished,\n> Agamemnon would have derived even greater pleasure if they could\n> permanently escape the domination of the damned thinking machines.\n>\n> *I fear that Norma will never amount to anything. How does that\n> reflect on me and my own legacy to humanity?*\n>\n> --- ZUFA CENVA\n>\n> **D**uring the tedious month-long journey across space to visit her\n> daughter on Poritrin, Zufa Cenva had plenty of time to ponder what she\n> would say when she arrived. She would rather have been spending so\n> many days and weeks elsewhere on her more important work. The loss of\n> dear Heoma weighed like a hot stone inside her chest. Ever since the\n> first devastating attack against the cymeks on Giedi Prime, Zufa had\n> been planning further strikes with her other Sorceress weapons.\n>\n> While most members of the League gave credit to Savant Holtzman for\n> the portable scrambler projectors, she had heard whispers that Norma\n> herself may have inspired the design. Could her oddball daughter have\n> done something so remarkable? Not as great as a psychic storm\n> obliterating cymeks, but still respectable. *Perhaps I have been blind\n> after all.* Zufa had never wanted Norma to fail, but had given up hope\n> by now. Maybe things could change in their relationship. *Should I\n> embrace her? Does she deserve my support and encouragement, or will\n> she make me ashamed of her?*\n>\n> These were uncertain times.\n>\n> As Zufa stepped off the transport in Starda, she encountered a\n> delegation waiting to greet her, complete with ornately garbed Dragoon\n> guards, their gold-scale armor immaculate. Ruddy-faced Lord Niko Bludd\n> himself led the group, his beard intricately curled, his clothes\n> perfumed and colorful.\n>\n> \"Poritrin is honored by the visit of a Sorceress!\" The noble stepped\n> forward on the mosaic tile floor. Bludd wore a dashing ceremonial\n> costume with broad carmine lapels, frilly white cuffs, and golden\n> shoes. A ceremonial sword hung at his waist, though he had probably\n> never used a blade for anything more dangerous than cutting cheese.\n>\n> She'd never had any use for frippery when there was work to be done,\n> and Bludd's arrival surprised her. She had hoped to conclude her\n> business with Norma unobtrusively and then quickly return to Rossak.\n> She and her dedicated psychic warriors must prepare another mental\n> strike against the cymeks.\n>\n> \"The shuttle captain transmitted a message that you were coming,\n> Madame Cenva,\" Bludd said, as he guided her through the terminal. \"We\n> barely had time to put together a reception for you. You are here to\n> see your daughter, I presume?\" Niko Bludd grinned above his curled\n> reddish beard. \"We are very proud of how much she is helping Savant\n> Holtzman. He considers her quite indispensible.\"\n>\n> \"Indeed?\" Zufa tried to control her skeptical frown.\n>\n> \"We invited Norma to join us today, but she is deeply engrossed in\n> important work for Savant Holtzman. She seemed to think that you would\n> understand why she could not meet you herself.\"\n>\n> Zufa felt as if she had been slapped. \"I have been en route for a\n> month. If *I* can make the time, then a mere . . . lab assistant can\n> arrange to pick me up.\"\n>\n> Outside the spaceport, a chauffeur guided her to a lavish airbarge,\n> and the Dragoon guards took their places at the rails. \"We will\n> transport you directly to Holtzman's laboratories.\" When Bludd seated\n> himself beside her, she wrinkled her nose at his strong body perfumes.\n> He extended a small package to her, which she didn't want.\n>\n> With a sigh of exasperation, Zufa sat rigidly in the comfortable seat\n> as the aircraft proceeded away from the spaceport. Removing the\n> package's silver wrapping paper, Zufa found a bottle of river water\n> and an exquisitely woven Poritrin towel.\n>\n> Despite her lack of interest, the flamboyant noble insisted on\n> explaining. \"It is traditional for honored guests to wash their hands\n> in the water of the Isana and dry themselves on our fine linen.\"\n>\n> She made no move to use the gifts. Beneath the flying barge, water\n> vessels traveled downriver toward the sprawling delta city, where\n> grains, metals, and manufactured supplies were distributed to Poritrin\n> suppliers. In the brown mudflats, hundreds of slaves worked in the\n> muck to plant paddies of shellfish. The sight made her feel even more\n> unsettled than she already was.\n>\n> \"The residence of Savant Holtzman is just ahead,\" Bludd said, pointing\n> to a high bluff. \"I am sure your daughter will be pleased to see you.\"\n>\n> *Has she ever been pleased to see me?* Zufa wondered. She tried to\n> calm herself with mental exercises, but anxiety intruded.\n>\n> With a sweep of her long black dress, she stepped away from the\n> ostentatious airbarge as soon as it set down on Holtzman's landing\n> deck. \"Lord Bludd, I have private business to discuss with my\n> daughter. I'm sure you understand.\" Without further farewell, Zufa\n> marched alone up the broad patio steps to the mansion, leaving a\n> befuddled Bludd behind her. She waved her long arms, shooing him away.\n>\n> Her telepathic senses attuned, Zufa entered the dwelling as if she\n> belonged there. Holtzman's vestibule was cluttered with disarrayed\n> boxes, books, and instruments. Either the household staff did not do\n> their work, or the inventor had forbidden them to \"organize\" too much.\n>\n> Picking a path through the obstacles, Zufa strode into a long hallway,\n> then searched rooms and demanded information from anyone she met until\n> she found her daughter. Finally, the tall and intimidating Sorceress\n> entered an auxiliary laboratory building, where she saw a high stool\n> at an angled lightstrip table that held blueprint films. No sign of\n> Norma.\n>\n> She noticed an open door that led out to a balcony, then saw a shadow,\n> heard something move. Gliding to the balcony, Zufa was shocked to see\n> her daughter perched on top of the railing. Norma gripped a red plaz\n> container in her small hands.\n>\n> \"What are you doing?\" Zufa asked. \"Get down from there immediately!\"\n>\n> Startled, Norma glanced at her looming mother, then clasped the object\n> tightly and leaped off the railing out into the open air.\n>\n> \"No!\" Zufa shouted. But it was too late.\n>\n> Rushing to the edge, the Sorceress saw to her horror that the balcony\n> jutted out over a high bluff that dropped to the river, far below. The\n> small-statured young woman tumbled through the air, falling.\n>\n> Suddenly, Norma paused in midair and spun in a peculiar fashion. She\n> called, \"See for yourself, it works! You arrived just in time!\" Then,\n> like a feather on the wind, the girl drifted upward. The red device\n> lifted her back toward the balcony, like an invisible hand.\n>\n> Norma reached the level of the railing, and her angry mother yanked\n> her back onto the balcony. \"Why would you try something so dangerous?\n> Doesn't Savant Holtzman prefer you to employ helpers for this sort of\n> test?\"\n>\n> Norma frowned. \"They have *slaves* here, not helpers. Besides, it is\n> my own invention, and I wanted to do it myself. I knew it would work.\"\n>\n> Zufa did not want to argue. \"You came all the way to Poritrin and used\n> the League's best engineering laboratories to design some sort of . .\n> . flying toy?\"\n>\n> \"Hardly, Mother.\" Norma opened the lid of the red plaz unit and\n> adjusted electronics inside. \"It is a variation on Savant Holtzman's\n> theories, a repelling, or suspensor field. I expect him to be\n> delighted by it.\"\n>\n> \"Oh, I am, I am!\" The scientist appeared suddenly and stood behind\n> Zufa. He quickly introduced himself, then looked at Norma's new\n> gadget. \"I'll show it to Lord Bludd and see what he thinks of the\n> commercial possibilities. I'm sure he'll want a patent in his own\n> name.\"\n>\n> Zufa looked on, still recovering from the shock of Norma's \"fall,\"\n> trying to see practical applications of her daughter's invention.\n> Could such a thing be\n>\n> modified to carry troops or heavy objects? She doubted it.\n>\n> Norma set down the red-plaz generator and crossed the room with her\n> awkward, waddling gait. She climbed her high stool to reach the\n> blueprint films on the slanted light table, where she sifted through\n> pages. \"I've figured out how this principle can also be used on\n> illumination devices. The suspensor field can float lights and power\n> them with residual energy. I have all the calculations . . .\n> somewhere.\"\n>\n> \"Floating lights?\" Zufa said, in scornful tone. \"For what, a picnic?\n> Tens of thousands died in the cymek attack on Zimia, millions were\n> enslaved on Giedi Prime, and you live in secluded comfort--- making\n> floating *lights*?\"\n>\n> Norma gave her mother a condescending look, as if *Zufa* was the\n> foolish one. \"Think beyond the obvious, Mother. A war needs more than\n> just weapons. Robots can alter their optic sensors to see in the dark,\n> but humans must have light to see. Hundreds of these suspensor lights\n> could be dispersed in a nighttime combat zone, negating any advantage\n> the machines might have. Savant Holtzman and I think along those lines\n> every day.\"\n>\n> The scientist nodded, quick to concur with her. \"Or, for commercial\n> uses, they could be designed in a number of styles, even tuned to any\n> color or shade.\"\n>\n> Norma sat on her stool like a gnome perched on a throne. Her brown\n> eyes sparkled with excitement. \"I'm sure Lord Bludd will be most\n> pleased.\"\n>\n> Zufa frowned. There were more important issues at stake in this war\n> than pleasing a foppish nobleman. Impatient, she said, \"I came a great\n> distance to see you.\"\n>\n> Norma raised her eyebrows skeptically. \"If you had bothered to see me\n> *before* I departed from Rossak, Mother, you wouldn't have needed to\n> make such a long voyage to soothe your guilt. But you were too busy to\n> notice.\"\n>\n> Uneasy in the midst of a family argument, Tio Holtzman excused\n> himself.\n>\n> The combatants hardly noticed his departure.\n>\n> Zufa had not intended to pick a fight, but now she felt defensive. \"My\n> Sorceresses have proved their abilities in battle. We can exert\n> tremendous power with our minds to eradicate the cymeks. A number of\n> candidates are preparing themselves to offer the ultimate sacrifice if\n> we are called upon to free another machine-dominated world.\" Her pale\n> eyes flashed, and she shook her head. \"But you don't worry about that,\n> do you, Norma--- since you have no telepathic abilities.\"\n>\n> \"I have other skills, Mother. I am making a valuable contribution,\n> too.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, your incomprehensible equations.\" Zufa nodded toward the\n> suspensor field generator on the floor. \"Your life is not at stake.\n> Safe and pampered, you spend your days playing with these *toys*. You\n> have let yourself be blinded by imaginary success.\" But her daughter\n> wasn't the only one. Many people lived in comfort and security while\n> Zufa and her Sorceresses performed dangerous tasks. How could Norma\n> compare her work to *that*? \"When you heard I was coming, Norma, could\n> you not have found time to meet me at the spaceport?\"\n>\n> Norma's tone was deceptively mild as she crossed her arms over her\n> small chest. \"I did not ask you to come here, Mother, because I know\n> you have many important things to do. And *I* have more urgent duties\n> than ferrying unexpected guests around. Besides, I knew Lord Bludd was\n> going to meet you.\"\n>\n> \"Are League nobles your errand boys now?\" Now that she had opened the\n> floodgates of her anger, Zufa couldn't stop the words that came next.\n> \"I only wanted you to make me proud, Norma, despite your deformities.\n> But nothing you do will ever amount to anything. Living here in\n> luxury, what sacrifices do you make? Your vision is too small to be of\n> any real use to humanity.\"\n>\n> Previously, Norma would have crumbled under such an onslaught, her\n> confidence crushed. But her work here with Holtzman, her obvious\n> successes in the technical arena, had given her a new view of herself.\n> Now she looked coolly at her mother. \"Just because I don't fit the\n> image of what\n>\n> you wanted me to be doesn't mean I'm not contributing something\n> essential. Savant Holtzman sees it, and so does Aurelius. You're my\n> own mother--- why can't you?\"\n>\n> With a snort at the mention of Venport's name, Zufa began pacing.\n> \"Aurelius is just a man with hallucinations from the drugs he takes.\"\n>\n> \"I had forgotten how narrow-minded you truly are, Mother,\" Norma said\n> in a level tone. \"Thank you for coming all this way to refresh my\n> memory.\" The girl turned on her stool and resumed her plans and\n> equations. \"I am tempted to summon one of the slaves to escort you\n> out, but I wouldn't want to remove them from their more important\n> work.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> FURIOUS AT HERSELF and her daughter--- and at the wasted time--- Zufa\n> returned to the spaceport. She would stay on Poritrin no longer. To\n> get her mind off her concerns, she concentrated on mental exercises\n> and thought of how her beloved trainees in the jungles were ready to\n> give their utmost to their tasks, without personal considerations.\n>\n> Zufa waited a full day for a military transport that would take her\n> back to Rossak. As she surrounded herself with waves of her own\n> clairvoyant powers, she discovered a rotten weakness on Poritrin, and\n> it had nothing to do with Norma. It was so obvious, she could not\n> avoid it.\n>\n> All around Starda, at loading sites near the spaceport, at the\n> warehouses and mudflats, Zufa detected the individual and collective\n> auras of the downtrodden laborers. She sensed a collective\n> psychological wound, a deep and simmering discontent to which the free\n> Poritrin citizens seemed completely oblivious.\n>\n> The backwash of brooding resentment gave her one more reason to want\n> to get away from this place.\n>\n> *Intuition is a function by which humans see around corners. It is\n> useful for persons who live exposed to dangerous natural conditions.*\n>\n> --- ERASMUS\n\n*Erasmus Dialogues*\n\n> **R**aised as the daughter of the League Viceroy, Serena Butler was\n> accustomed to working hard to serve humanity, looking toward a bright\n> future even against the backdrop of constant war. She had never\n> imagined laboring as a slave inside the household of an enemy robot.\n>\n> From her first glance at Erasmus in the broad entry plaza of the\n> villa, Serena disliked him intensely. Conversely, the thinking machine\n> was intrigued by her. She suspected that his interest was probably a\n> dangerous thing.\n>\n> He chose to wear fine clothes, loose robes and fluffy, ornate furs\n> that made his robot body look absurd. His mirrored face made him\n> appear alien, and his demeanor made her flesh crawl. His relentless\n> curiosity about mankind seemed perverse and unnatural. When he\n> strutted across the plaza toward Serena, his pliable metal mask\n> shifted into a delighted grin.\n>\n> \"You are Serena Butler,\" he said. \"Have you been informed that Giedi\n> Prime was recaptured by the feral humans? Such a disappointment. Why\n> are humans willing to sacrifice so much to maintain their inefficient\n> chaos?\"\n>\n> Serena's heart lifted at news of the liberation, in part because of\n> her own efforts. Xavier had brought the Armada after all, and Brigit\n> Paterson's engineers must have succeeded in activating the secondary\n> shield transmitters. Serena, however, remained enslaved--- and\n> pregnant with Xavier's child. No one even knew where she was or what\n> had happened to her. Xavier and her father must be insane with grief,\n> convinced that the machines had killed her.\n>\n> \"Perhaps it's not surprising that you don't comprehend or value the\n> human concept of freedom,\" she replied. \"For all your convoluted\n> gelcircuitry, you're still just a machine. The understanding wasn't\n> *programmed* into you.\"\n>\n> Her eyes stung at the thought of how much more she wanted to achieve\n> to help other people. On Salusa, she had never taken her family's\n> wealth for granted, feeling a need to earn the blessings bestowed upon\n> her.\n>\n> She asked, \"So, are you inquisitive, or inquisitor?\"\n>\n> \"Perhaps both.\" The robot leaned close to examine her, noting the\n> proud lift of her chin. \"I expect you to offer me many insights.\" He\n> touched her cheek with a cool, flexible finger. \"Lovely skin.\"\n>\n> She forced herself not to pull away. *Resistance must count for\n> something more than a captive's pride*, her mother had once told her.\n> If Serena struggled, Erasmus could hold her with his powerful robotic\n> grasp, or summon mechanized torturing devices. \"My skin is no more\n> lovely than yours,\" she said, \"except mine is not synthetic. My skin\n> was designed by nature, not by the mind of a machine.\"\n>\n> The robot chuckled, a tinny cachination. \"You see, I expect to learn\n> much from you.\" He led her into his lush greenhouses, which she\n> observed with reluctant delight.\n>\n> At the age of ten she had become fascinated with gardening, and had\n> delivered plants, herbs, and sweet exotic fruits to medical centers,\n> refugee complexes, and veteran homes, where she also volunteered her\n> services. Around Zimia, Serena had been renowned for her ability to\n> cultivate beautiful flowers. Under her loving attention, exquisite\n> little Immian roses bloomed, as did Poritrin hibiscus and even the\n> delicate morning violets of distant Kaitain.\n>\n> \"I will have you tend my prized plaza gardens,\" Erasmus said.\n>\n> \"Why can't machines perform such tasks? I'm sure they'd be much more\n> efficient--- or do you just revel in making your 'creators' do the\n> work?\"\n>\n> \"Do you not feel up to the task?\"\n>\n> \"I will do as you command--- for the sake of the plants.\" Pointedly\n> ignoring him, she touched a strangely shaped red and orange flower.\n> \"This looks like a bird of paradise, a pure strain from an ancient\n> stock. According to legend, these plants were favored by the sea kings\n> of Old Earth.\" With a look of defiance, Serena turned back to the\n> robot. \"There, now I have taught you something.\"\n>\n> Erasmus chuckled again, as if replaying a recording. \"Excellent. Now\n> tell me what you were truly thinking.\"\n>\n> She remembered words her father had spoken---*Fear invites aggression;\n> do not show it to a predator*--- and felt emboldened. \"While I was\n> telling you about a beautiful flower, I was thinking that I despise\n> you and all of your kind. I was a free and independent being, until\n> you took it all away from me. Machines stole my home, my life, and the\n> man I love.\"\n>\n> The sentient robot was not at all offended. \"Ah, your lover! Is he the\n> one who impregnated you?\"\n>\n> Serena glared at Erasmus, then made up her mind. Perhaps she could\n> find a way to use this machine's curiosity, turning it against him\n> somehow. \"You will learn the most from me if I cooperate, if I talk\n> freely. I can teach you things you would never learn for yourself.\"\n>\n> \"Excellent.\" The robot seemed genuinely pleased.\n>\n> Serena's eyes grew hard. \"But I expect something from you in return.\n> Guarantee the safety of my unborn baby. Allow me to raise the child\n> here in your household.\"\n>\n> Erasmus knew it was a standard parental imperative for her to be\n> worried about her offspring, and that gave him leverage. \"You have\n> either arrogance\n>\n> or ambition. But I shall consider your request, depending on how much\n> I enjoy our discussions and debates.\"\n>\n> Spotting a fat beetle at the base of a terra cotta planter, Erasmus\n> nudged it with one foot. The insect had a black shell with an\n> intricate red design. His smooth face mask shifted, flowed, until the\n> shaping film displayed an amused expression. Erasmus let the beetle\n> nearly escape, then moved his smooth foot to block it again.\n> Persistent, it scuttled in another direction.\n>\n> \"You and I have a great deal in common, Serena Butler,\" he said.\n> Remotely, he activated a contraband Chusuk music cube, hoping the\n> melody would draw out her internal emotions. \"Each of us has an\n> independent mind. I respect that in you, because it is such an\n> integral part of my own personality.\"\n>\n> Serena resented any such comparison, but held her tongue.\n>\n> Erasmus scooped the beetle onto one hand, but his primary interest\n> dwelled on Serena--- he was intrigued at how humans tried to keep so\n> much of themselves veiled. Perhaps, by applying various pressures, he\n> could see through to her inner core.\n>\n> With the music playing in the background, Erasmus continued, \"Some\n> robots keep their own personalities rather than simply uploading a\n> portion of the evermind. I began as a thinking machine on Corrin, but\n> I chose not to accept regular Omnius updates that would synchronize me\n> with the evermind.\"\n>\n> Serena saw that the beetle was immobile on his metallic palm. She\n> wondered if he had killed it.\n>\n> \"But a singular event changed me forever,\" Erasmus said, his voice\n> pleasant, as if telling a story about a quaint forest outing. \"I had\n> set out across Corrin's unsettled territories on a private scouting\n> mission. Because I was inquisitive and did not wish to accept the\n> standard analyses compiled by Omnius, I ventured into the landscape on\n> my own. It was rugged, rocky, and wild. I had never seen vegetation\n> except for in the areas where Old\n>\n> Empire terraformers had planted new ecosystems. Corrin was never a\n> living world, you see, except where humans had made it so.\n> Unfortunately, tending fertile fields and beautifying the land was no\n> longer a priority of my kind.\" He looked at Serena to see if she was\n> enjoying his story.\n>\n> \"Unexpectedly, far from the city grid and robot support systems, I was\n> unprotected from a severe solar storm. Corrin's red-giant sun is in\n> turmoil and unstable, with frequent flare activity, sudden hurricanes\n> of radiation. Such an onslaught is hazardous to biological life-forms,\n> but the original human settlers were resilient.\n>\n> \"My delicate neurelectric circuitry, however, was rather more\n> sensitive. I should have dispatched scout scanners to keep watch on\n> the star-storms, but I was too engrossed in my own investigations. I\n> found myself exposed and damaged from the radiation flux, disoriented\n> and far from the central complex run by the Corrin-Omnius.\" Erasmus\n> actually sounded embarrassed. \"I wandered away and I . . . tumbled\n> into a narrow crevasse.\"\n>\n> Serena looked at him in surprise.\n>\n> \"Despite dropping deep into the crack, my body was only slightly\n> damaged.\" He lifted an arm, looked at his flexible fiber-wrapped limb,\n> the organic-polymer skin, the flowmetal coating. \"I was trapped, out\n> of transmission range, and basically immobilized. I could not move for\n> an entire Corrin year . . . twenty Terran standard years.\n>\n> \"The crevasse's deep shadow shielded me from solar radiation, and soon\n> enough, my mental processors recovered. I was awake, but I could go\n> nowhere. I could not move . . . only think, for a long, long time. I\n> spent a seemingly endless blazing summer there, wedged in the rocks,\n> and then I endured the ensuing long winter locked in heavy, compacted\n> ice. During all that time, two decades, I had nothing to do but\n> *contemplate*.\"\n>\n> \"No one to talk to but yourself,\" she said. \"Poor, lonely robot.\"\n>\n> Ignoring the remark, Erasmus said, \"Such an ordeal altered my\n> fundamental nature in ways I could never have foreseen. In fact,\n> Omnius still does not\n>\n> understand me.\"\n>\n> By the time he'd finally been discovered and rescued by other robots,\n> Erasmus had developed an individual personality. After his restoration\n> and reintegration into the cooperative machine society, Omnius had\n> asked Erasmus if he wished to be upgraded with standardized character\n> traits.\n>\n> \"*Upgraded*, he called it,\" Erasmus said with some amusement. \"But I\n> declined the offer. After reaching such . . . enlightenment, I was\n> reluctant to delete my impulses and ideas, my thoughts and memories.\n> It seemed too great a loss to bear. And the Corrin-Omnius soon\n> discovered how much he enjoyed sparring with me verbally.\"\n>\n> Now, peering at the motionless beetle on his artificial hand, Erasmus\n> said matter-of-factly, \"I am a celebrity among the widespread\n> everminds. They look forward to receiving updates containing my\n> actions and assertions, like a serial publication. These are known as\n> the 'Erasmus Dialogues.'\"\n>\n> With a guarded look, she nodded toward the motionless insect. \"And\n> will you include a discussion of that beetle? How can you understand\n> something you have killed?\"\n>\n> \"It is not dead,\" Erasmus assured her. \"I detect a faint but\n> unmistakable throb of life. The creature wants me to believe it is\n> deceased, so that I will discard it. Despite its small size, it has a\n> powerful will to survive.\"\n>\n> Kneeling, he set the beetle on a flagstone with a surprisingly gentle\n> touch, then stepped back. Moments later, the bug stirred and scampered\n> to safety under the planter. \"See? I wish to understand all living\n> things--- including you.\"\n>\n> Serena glowered. The robot had managed to surprise her.\n>\n> \"Omnius does not think I can ever attain his intellectual level,\"\n> Erasmus said. \"But he remains intrigued by my mental agility--- the\n> way my mind continually evolves in new and impulsive directions. Like\n> that beetle, I am capable of springing to life and persevering.\"\n>\n> \"Do you really expect to become more than a machine?\"\n>\n> Taking no offense, Erasmus replied, \"It is a human trait to better\n> oneself, is it not? That is all I am trying to do.\"\n>\n> *One direction is as good as another.*\n>\n> --- saying of the Open Land\n>\n> **B**y the tenth time he rode a giant sandworm, Selim was proficient\n> enough to enjoy the experience. No other thrill could compare to the\n> power of a leviathan of the deep desert. He loved racing across the\n> dunes while perched on the high ridges of a worm, crossing an ocean of\n> sand in a single day.\n>\n> Selim had brought water, rugged clothing, equipment, and food from the\n> abandoned botanical testing station. His crystal sandworm tooth proved\n> a valuable tool as well as a mark of personal pride. Inside the empty\n> station, he had sometimes stared at the smooth milky curve of the\n> blade under the dim light of recharge panels and imagined a religious\n> significance to the object. It was a relic of his supreme test out\n> here in this wasteland, and a symbol that Buddallah was watching over\n> him. Perhaps the worms were part of his destiny.\n>\n> He came to believe that the sandworms were not Shaitan after all, but\n> blessings from Buddallah himself, perhaps even tangible manifestations\n> of God.\n>\n> After months of recuperation and boredom inside the old research\n> facility, living without purpose, Selim had known he must go out and\n> ride a sandworm again. He needed to learn exactly what it was that\n> Buddallah expected of him.\n>\n> He had carefully marked the location of the testing station.\n> Unfortunately, since he couldn't guide the sandworms, he knew it would\n> be a challenge to make his way back to the secret place. Upon\n> departing, he had carried everything necessary on his back.\n>\n> He was Selim Wormrider, chosen and guided by Buddallah. He needed no\n> help from others.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AFTER KILLING TWO more sandworms by riding them until they collapsed\n> of exhaustion, Selim discovered that it was not necessary to slay a\n> worm just so he could get safely away. It was possible, though risky,\n> to dismount from a weary beast by running down the length of its back,\n> leaping away from the hot tail, and then racing toward nearby rocks.\n> The depleted worm, too tired to give chase, would wallow in deep dust,\n> and sulk.\n>\n> This satisfied Selim, because it seemed wrong to destroy the creatures\n> that gave him transportation. If the sandworms were emissaries from\n> Buddallah, and old men of the desert, then he must treat them with\n> respect.\n>\n> On his fourth ride, he discovered how to manipulate the sensitive\n> edges of worm rings, using a shovel-bladed tool and the sharp metal\n> spear to prod Shaitan in the direction Selim wished to go. It was a\n> simple concept, but one that required a great deal of work. His\n> muscles ached by the time he dropped away from a spent worm and ran to\n> the shelter of nearby rocks. He remained lost out in the deep desert .\n> . . but in a very real sense, the desert belonged to him now. He was\n> invincible! Buddallah would care for him.\n>\n> Selim still had an adequate supply of water from the distilling units\n> in the testing station, and his diet consisted of large amounts of\n> melange, which gave him strength and energy. As soon as he learned how\n> to master the worms, he was able to travel wherever he chose, working\n> his way back toward the abandoned station.\n>\n> Other Zensunnis would have called him mad, appalled at his foolhardy\n> attempt to tame the terrifying sandworms. But the young exile no\n> longer cared a whit how people felt about him. He was in touch with\n> another realm. He felt in his heart that this was what he had been\n> born todo. . . .\n>\n> Now under the double moonlight, Selim guided his worm as it hissed\n> across the sands. Hours ago, the creature had ceased trying to throw\n> him off, and instead plunged onward, resigned to the commands of the\n> imp who kept inflicting pain in the sensitive flesh between ring\n> segments. Selim navigated\n>\n> by the stars, drawing lines like arrows between constellations. The\n> unforgiving landscape began to look familiar, and he believed he was\n> at last close to the botanical testing station, his sanctuary. Back\n> home.\n>\n> All alone atop the sandworm, surrounded by the bitter aromas of\n> brimstone and cinnamon, he allowed himself to think and dream. He'd\n> had little else to do since his exile.

Another\n> test?\n>\n> Using his spear and the shovel-spreader, Selim drove the worm toward\n> the rocks, thinking he might beach the creature on the outcroppings,\n> where it would thrash and wriggle its way back to the soft sanctuary\n> of sand. The eyeless monster sensed the rocks, recognizing a\n> difference in viscosity and vibrations within the sand, and swerved in\n> the opposite direction.\n>\n> Selim pulled harder on the shovel and jabbed with the spear. The\n> confused worm twitched and slowed. As it curled close to the nearest\n> line of rock, Selim yanked himself and his equipment free. He tumbled\n> down the creature's ring segments until he dropped to the sand and\n> then ran away at full speed.\n>\n> The safe reef of rock was less than a hundred meters distant, and the\n> worm thrashed about as if it couldn't believe it had been so\n> unexpectedly released. Finally, it sensed the rhythm of Selim's racing\n> footsteps. The monster turned and lunged toward him.\n>\n> Selim ran faster, bolting toward the boulders. He sprang onto a shelf\n> of sharp lava rock and kept running, spitting pebbles from beneath the\n> soles of his boots.\n>\n> The worm exploded out of the sand, its head questing, its cavernous\n> maw open. It hesitated as if afraid to go closer to the rock barrier,\n> then slammed downward.\n>\n> Selim had already scrambled up and over the second line of boulders,\n> diving between rough-edged stones into a pocket, less than a cave but\n> enough for him to wedge his body into. The sandworm crashed like a\n> gigantic hammer into the ridge, but it did not know where the little\n> human had gone to ground.\n>\n> Enraged, the worm pulled back, its gaping mouth exuding an\n> overpowering stench of melange. It smashed its big head against the\n> rocks again, then retreated. Frustrated and beaten, it finally dragged\n> itself away, wallowed through the sands, and then sank below the dune\n> crests. Slow and indignant, it headed back out to the deep desert.\n>\n> His heart pounding, adrenaline charging his bloodstream, Selim crawled\n> out of the shelter. He looked around, amazed that he had made it back\n> alive. Laughing, he praised Buddallah at the top of his lungs. The old\n> botanical testing station was above him on the ridge, waiting for him.\n> He would spend several days there, replenishing his supplies and\n> drinking plenty of water.\n>\n> As he began to climb with weary arms and legs, Selim saw something\n> glint in the moonlight, lost in the broken rocks against which the\n> furious worm had smashed itself. Another crystalline tooth, a longer\n> one. It had broken free during the demon's attack and now lay in a\n> cranny. Selim reached down and plucked out the curved, milky weapon. A\n> reward from\n>\n> Buddallah!

But before he decided if the intriguing message was more than\n> just fantasy, he needed to do some research. Iblis had survived so\n> well and so long because he was cautious and obedient. Now he had to\n> conduct his investigations in such a manner that the machines would\n> never suspect his intent.\n>\n> For answers, he could think of no better source than the Cogitor Eklo.\n>\n> Years ago Iblis had been a member of an armed slave-pursuit team,\n> chasing a few deluded people who had senselessly escaped from the city\n> grid and fled into the hills with no plans, survival skills, or\n> supplies. Wild rumors had convinced the gullible escapees that they\n> could demand sanctuary from the politically neutral Cogitors. A\n> foolish notion, considering that the meditative and detached human\n> brains wanted nothing more than to isolate themselves and contemplate\n> their esoteric thoughts. The Cogitors had not cared about the Time of\n> Titans, the Hrethgir Rebellions, or Omnius's creation of the\n> Synchronized Worlds. Cogitors did not wish to be disturbed, so the\n> thinking machines tolerated them.\n>\n> When Iblis and his pursuit team had surrounded the isolated monastery\n> on the rugged mountainside, Eklo had dispatched his human secondaries\n> to drive the slaves out of concealment. The escapees had cursed and\n> threatened the Cogitor, but Eklo passively ignored them. Iblis and his\n> armed companions had then brought the slaves in for \"vigorous\n> reassignment,\" after tossing their ringleader off a high cliff. . . .\n>\n> Now the sturdy burrhorse ascended the steep path that shifted and\n> crumbled beneath its hooves. Presently Iblis made out the high tower\n> of the monastery, an impressive stone structure partly shrouded in\n> mists. Its windows glowed red and then shifted to a sky blue,\n> reportedly according to the moods of the great contemplative mind.\n>\n> In his schooling as a trustee, Iblis had learned about the Cogitors,\n> about the primitive remnants of religion still manifested by some of\n> the larger groups of human slaves. Omnius had ceased trying to quash\n> it, though the evermind did not understand the superstitions and\n> rituals.\n>\n> Long before the takeover of the Old Empire, Eklo had left his physical\n> body behind and devoted his mind to analysis and introspection. While\n> planning the large-scale overthrow of humanity, the Titan Juno had\n> adopted Eklo as her personal advisor, demanding answers. Uninterested\n> in repercussions, taking no sides in the conflict, Eklo had answered\n> Juno's questions, and his unwitting advice had helped the Titans plan\n> their conquest. In the thousand years since, Eklo had remained on\n> Earth. The driving passion in his long life was to synthesize a\n> complete understanding of the universe.\n>\n> Reaching the end of the trail at the base of the stone tower, Iblis\n> suddenly found himself surrounded by a dozen robed men armed with\n> archaic pikes and barbed clubs. Their robes were dark brown, and they\n> wore white clerical collars. One of the secondaries grabbed the reins\n> of Iblis's burrhorse. \"Leave here. We offer no sanctuary.\"\n>\n> \"I do not seek it.\" Iblis gazed down at the men. \"I have only come to\n> ask the Cogitor a question.\" He dismounted and, after charming them\n> with his warmth and sincerity, glided confidently toward the high\n> tower, leaving the robed men to hold his burrhorse.\n>\n> \"Cogitor Eklo is deep in thought and does not wish to be disturbed,\"\n> one of the secondaries called out.\n>\n> Iblis chuckled lightly, his voice smooth. \"The Cogitor has been\n> thinking for a thousand years.

I will not waste his time.\"\n>\n> Frowning skeptically at Iblis, the monk adjusted his clerical collar\n> and said, \"You are bold enough, and the Cogitor is curious to hear\n> your question.\" After checking the visitor's body for weapons, he\n> said, \"I am Aquim. Come this way.\"\n>\n> The big man led Iblis along a narrow stone corridor and up a steep\n> spiral stairway. As they proceeded, Iblis said, \"I have been here\n> before, chasing escaped slaves---\"\n>\n> \"Eklo remembers,\" Aquim interrupted.\n>\n> They reached the highest point in the structure, a round room at the\n> pinnacle of the tower. The Cogitor's plexiplaz container rested on an\n> altarlike ledge beneath one of the windows. Winds hummed along the\n> window edges and swirled the mists. The windows shimmered sky blue\n> from some internal illumination.\n>\n> Leaving the other secondaries behind, Aquim stepped up to the\n> transparent brain canister and stood for a moment, looking down at it\n> reverently. He jabbed a hand into one of his pockets, and his\n> trembling fingers emerged with a twisted strip of paper encrusted with\n> a black powder. He placed the strip in his mouth, letting it dissolve.\n> His eyes rolled upward, as if in ecstasy.\n>\n> \"Semuta,\" he said to Iblis, \"derived from the burned residue of elacca\n> wood, smuggled here. It aids me in what I must do.\" With complete\n>\n> serenity, he rested both hands against the smooth lip of the canister,\n> and said, \"I understand nothing.\"\n>\n> The naked brain inside its blue soup of electrafluid seemed to pulse,\n> waiting.\n>\n> With a beatific smile, the big monk drew a deep breath and slid his\n> fingers into the open mouth of the tank, dipping into the thick\n> life-support liquid. The gelatinous medium wet his skin, penetrated\n> his pores, linked with his nerve endings. Aquim's expression changed,\n> and he said, \"Eklo wishes to know why you did not ask your question\n> the last time you were here.\"\n>\n> Iblis did not know if he should speak to the secondary or directly to\n> the Cogitor, so he directed his reply to a space between them. \"At the\n> time, I did not understand what was significant. Now there is\n> something I wish to know from you. No one else can provide an\n> objective answer.\"\n>\n> \"No judgment or opinion is ever completely objective.\" The big monk\n> spoke with calm conviction. \"There are no absolutes.\"\n>\n> \"You are less biased than anyone else I could ask.\"\n>\n> The altar ledge moved around slowly along a hidden track, and the\n> Cogitor came to rest in front of a different window, with Aquim\n> keeping pace, his hand still immersed in the canister. \"State your\n> question.\"\n>\n> \"I have always worked loyally for my cymek and machine masters,\" Iblis\n> began, selecting his words carefully. \"Lately I received word that\n> there may be human resistance groups on Earth.

Are there people who want to overthrow their\n> rulers and gain freedom?\"\n>\n> During a moment's hesitation, the secondary stared blankly into space,\n> either from the effects of the semuta or from his connection with the\n> philosopher brain. Iblis hoped the Cogitor would not drift into a long\n> period of contemplation. Finally, in a deep and sonorous voice, Aquim\n> said, \"Nothing is impossible.\"\n>\n> Iblis tried several variations of the question, deftly circling with\n> phrases, adjusting his selection of words. He did not want to reveal\n> his intentions, though the neutral Cogitor presumably did not care why\n> Iblis might want to find the rebels, whether to destroy them or to\n> join them. Each time, however, Iblis received the same enigmatic\n> answer.\n>\n> Summoning his courage, he finally asked, \"If such a widespread, secret\n> resistance organization *did* exist, would it have a chance of\n> succeeding? Could the reign of the thinking machines possibly come to\n> an end?\"\n>\n> This time the Cogitor pondered longer, as if assessing different\n> factors in the question. When the same answer came via the robed monk,\n> the words, spoken more ominously, seemed to convey a deeper meaning.\n> \"Nothing is impossible.\"\n>\n> After that, Aquim withdrew his dripping hand from Eklo's brain\n> container, signifying that the audience was concluded. Iblis bowed\n> politely, expressed his gratitude, and departed, his own thoughts in\n> turmoil.\n>\n> On the ride back down the steep trail, the frightened but exhilarated\n> crew supervisor decided that if he could not locate one of the\n> resistance group members, he had another option.\n>\n> Drawing from his deeply loyal work crews, Iblis would form a rebel\n> cell of his own.\n>\n> *Conflict prolonged over an extended period tends to be\n> self-perpetuating and can easily plunge out of control.*\n>\n> --- TLALOC,\n>\n> *A Time for Titans*\n>\n> **\"A**fter a thousand years, only five of us remain.\"\n>\n> It was rare for the surviving Titans to congregate, especially on\n> Earth where the eyes of Omnius watched them every moment.

After the formal\n> eulogy many speakers took turns at the podium to praise her acts of\n> generosity.\n>\n> Xavier listened to the tributes. The representatives looked at him\n> compassionately. He thought of the life he and Serena had meant to\n> share.\n>\n> For her sake, though, Xavier had not, and would not, shed tears\n> openly. If the human race wept for all those who had fallen, they\n> would be paralyzed in an unending state of grief. His lips trembled,\n> and his vision blurred, but he forced himself to be strong. It was his\n> duty. Although his heart grieved, Xavier's mind turned to furious\n> thoughts of the enemy, and of traitorous human sympathizers who fought\n> beside the robots.\n>\n> His memory of Serena would be his constant source of strength and\n> inspiration. Even in death, she would drive him to achievements that\n> he never could have attained without her. He still had the black\n> diamond necklace that projected her last message to him, her brave\n> call to arms to help Giedi Prime. Lovely Serena would watch over him\n> always--- as she did now, when he was about to rally the resources and\n> military might of the angry masses.\n>\n> Shaken and grim, Xavier stepped into the projection dome, followed by\n> a sallow-skinned Viceroy Butler. Both men wore silver-and-blue robes\n> and capes, with black headbands in honor of their fallen loved one.\n>\n> It was time for the continuing business of humanity.\n>\n> After his recent military success, he needed little introduction. \"We\n> are human beings, and have always fought for our rights and our\n> dignity. We formed the League of Nobles so that free men could resist\n> the Titans, and after them the thinking machines. Only by standing\n> united have we been able to stop the headlong conquests of our\n> enemies.\" He scanned the\n>\n> representatives seated in the crowded hall. \"But at times the League\n> is its own worst enemy.\"\n>\n> The attendees respected this hero too much to argue, and Xavier\n> continued quickly and concisely. \"While we pay lip service to our\n> alliance, the League Worlds remain self-centered and independent. When\n> a beleaguered planet calls for help, the League debates and agonizes\n> for months before we decide on our response--- until it is too late!\n> We saw that on Giedi Prime. Only Serena's folly forced us to act\n> swiftly enough to make a difference. She knew exactly what she was\n> doing, and paid for it with her life.\"\n>\n> When a few of the representatives began to mutter, Xavier's skin grew\n> hot and he silenced them with a booming voice. \"The League of Nobles\n> must form a stronger coalition under streamlined leadership. To be\n> effective against a highly organized computer evermind, we need a\n> closely knit government of humans, better than this loose structure.\"\n> He waved his hands as he spoke.\n>\n> \"As Serena Butler advocated, we must make every effort to secure the\n> cooperation of the Unallied Planets, thus strengthening our defensive\n> framework and adding a buffer zone to our protected territory.\"\n>\n> Viceroy Butler stepped close beside him and added in a voice cracking\n> with emotion, \"That was always my daughter's dream. Now we must make\n> it ours.\"\n>\n> Several uncertain nobles rose in respectful dissent. A lean,\n> hard-looking woman from Kirana III said, \"Bringing so many worlds\n> together under tight rule, especially in a military guise, reminds me\n> of the Time of Titans.\"\n>\n> A small-statured nobleman from Hagal shouted, \"No more empires!\"\n>\n> Xavier raised his own voice. \"Isn't an empire better than\n> *extinction*? While you worry about political nuances, Omnius is\n> conquering star systems!\"\n>\n> But another said, \"For centuries the League of Nobles and Synchronized\n> Worlds have held each other at bay, in an uneasy equilibrium. Omnius\n> has\n>\n> never pressed beyond the boundaries of the Old Empire. We always\n> assumed the thinking machines didn't consider it efficient or\n> worthwhile. Why should that change now?\"\n>\n> \"For whatever reason, it *has* changed! The thinking machines seem\n> intent on genocide.\" Xavier clenched his fists; he had not expected to\n> argue over this, when the evidence was so obvious. \"Must we cower\n> behind our paper-thin defense and simply *react* whenever Omnius\n> chooses to test us? As we did here on Salusa a year ago, as we did on\n> Giedi Prime?\"\n>\n> In a dramatic outburst, he hefted the podium and sent it crashing\n> through one side of the dome enclosure. The front row of nobles\n> scrambled away from the shower of broken prismatic glass. Shocked\n> representatives yelled that Xavier's behavior was uncalled-for; others\n> summoned security guards to remove the distraught officer from the\n> hall.\n>\n> Stepping through the broken enclosure, Xavier shouted without the\n> benefit of a voice amplifier, \"Good! That's the kind of spirit I want\n> to see! The League has been cringing for too long. I have spoken with\n> other Armada commanders, and most of us agree: We need to change our\n> tactics and surprise the machines. We should spend whatever money is\n> necessary, recruit the imagination of all our scientists, and develop\n> new weapons--- weapons suitable for destroying Omnius, not just to\n> protect us here at home. One day, I believe we must go on the\n> *offensive*! It is the only way we can win this conflict.\"\n>\n> Gradually, the assemblage understood that Xavier had intentionally\n> provoked a reaction. With a polished boot, he kicked broken debris off\n> the stage. \"Experience is our best teacher. The machines could attack\n> Salusa again at any moment, or Poritrin, or Rossak, or Hagal, Ginaz,\n> Kirana III, Seneca, Vertree Colony, Relicon--- need I go on? None of\n> our worlds are safe.\" He raised a scolding finger. \"But if we turn the\n> tables, we can drive the aggressors back with bold, unforeseen moves.\"\n> He paused. \"Do we have the nerve to do it? Can we develop the weapons\n> to succeed? The time for complacency is past.\"\n>\n> In the ensuing discussion, Zufa Cenva offered more telepathy raids\n> against cymeks. Many more prime Sorceress candidates had already\n> volunteered, she said. Lord Niko Bludd bragged of the continuing work\n> of Tio Holtzman, who planned to test a new \"alloy resonator\" soon.\n> Other League representatives offered suggestions, targets, ways to\n> strengthen their position.\n>\n> Relieved and inspired, Xavier gazed around the assemblage. He had\n> shamed them into a show of boisterous support, and the voices of\n> dissent--- for now--- remained subdued.\n>\n> Unbidden tears ran down his face, and he tasted salt on his lips.\n> Drained of emotion and energy, he noticed Viceroy Butler looking\n> proudly at him, as if the young man were his son.\n>\n> *I am assuming the mantle of Serena*, Xavier realized, *doing what she\n> would have done.*\n>\n> *As if to balance the pain and suffering, War has also been the\n> breeding ground for some of our greatest dreams and accomplishments.*\n\n--- HOLTZMAN,\n\nacceptance speech, Poritrin Medal of Valor\n\n> **B**lindly confident, Tio Holtzman plunged ahead with his new idea,\n> making Norma Cenva feel like chaff in a gusting wind. With his\n> alloy-resonance generator, the inventor insisted on proving himself to\n> her.\n>\n> Though she remained doubtful that his concept would work, Norma could\n> not demonstrate her reason for uncertainty with straightforward\n> mathematical proofs. Instinct spoke to her like a nagging voice, but\n> she kept her worries to herself. After Holtzman's sour reaction to her\n> initial reservations, he had not asked for her opinion again.\n>\n> Norma hoped that she was mistaken. She was *human*, after all, and far\n> from perfect.\n\nWhile the Savant busied himself inside the domed demonstration\nlaboratory\n\n> --- a theater-sized structure atop an adjoining bluff--- Norma kept to\n> the sidelines. Even her most innocent participation made him nervous,\n> as if he put more stock in her doubts than he admitted aloud.\n>\n> Now she stood on the span of the bridge between bluff sections and\n> reached up to grab the rail. Listening to breezes hum through the\n> cables, she peered through safety netting at the river traffic far\n> below.\n>\n> She heard Holtzman inside the domed demo-lab, shouting to slaves as\n> they erected a bulky generator that produced a resonating field\n> intended to shake apart and melt a metal form. An imperious presence\n> in a white-and-purple robe, he wore chains of office about his neck,\n> baubles that signified his scientific awards and achievements.\n> Holtzman glared at his workers, then paced around, double-checking,\n> watching every detail.\n>\n> Lord Bludd and a handful of Poritrin nobles would join them to watch\n> the day's test, so Norma understood Holtzman's anxiety. She herself\n> would never have made such an extravagant presentation of an untried\n> device, but the scientist did not show even a glimmer of doubt.\n>\n> \"Norma, please assist me in here,\" Holtzman called in an exasperated\n> tone. On short legs she ran from the bridge into the enclosure. He\n> gestured disgustedly toward the slaves. \"They don't understand a thing\n> I've told them to do. Supervise them, so I can test the calibration.\"\n>\n> At the center of the reinforced chamber, Holtzman's crew had erected a\n> metal mannequin that had the vague features of a combat robot. Norma\n> had never seen a real thinking machine, but had scrutinized many\n> stored images. She stared at the mockup. This was the enemy, the true\n> foe against which all of her work must be directed.\n>\n> She looked at her mentor with more compassion, understanding his\n> desperation. Holtzman was morally obligated to pursue *any* idea, to\n> find *any* way to continue this noble fight. He had a good feel for\n> projected energies, distortion fields, and nonprojectile weaponry. She\n> hoped his alloy-resonance generator would work after all.\n>\n> Before the slaves had finished rigging the test apparatus, a commotion\n> occurred outside the main house. Ribbon-festooned ceremonial barges\n> came into view above the cliffs, where Holtzman's balconies overlooked\n> the river. Scale-armored Dragoon guards stood on the flying craft with\n> Lord Bludd, along with five senators and a black-robed court\n> historian.\n>\n> Holtzman dropped what he was doing. \"Norma, finish this. Please!\"\n> Without looking back at her, he rushed across the connecting bridge to\n> greet his prestigious visitors.\n>\n> Norma urged the slaves to hurry, as she personally adjusted the\n> calibrations and attuned the apparatus to the inventor's\n> specifications. Light shone through high skylights to illuminate the\n> robot facsimile. Reinforced metal ceiling beams crisscrossed the\n> overhead vault, supporting pulleys and\n>\n> winches that had been used to haul the blockish resonance generator\n> into place.\n>\n> Moody Zenshiite slaves milled about, wearing traditional clothing,\n> red-and-white stripes wrapped around serviceable gray jumpsuits. Many\n> slave owners didn't allow their captives to show signs of\n> individuality, but Holtzman didn't care one way or the other. He only\n> wanted the captive people to perform their tasks without complaint.\n>\n> As they completed their work the slaves backed close to the plated\n> wall, their dark gazes averted. One black-bearded, shadowy-eyed man\n> spoke to them in a language unfamiliar to Norma. Moments later a\n> grinning Holtzman ushered his impressive guests into the demonstration\n> area.\n>\n> The Savant made a grand entrance. At his side, Niko Bludd wore a\n> billowing azure tunic and a scarlet doublet fastened across his barrel\n> chest. His reddish beard had been curled in neat ringlets. Small\n> tattooed circles looked like bubbles at the far points of each eyelid.\n>\n> Walking past the slaves, Bludd noticed Norma and gave the diminutive\n> woman a smile that was both condescending and paternal. Norma bent in\n> a formal bow and politely grasped his slick, lotioned hand.\n>\n> \"We know your time is valuable, Lord Bludd. Therefore, everything has\n> been prepared.\" Holtzman folded his hands. \"This new device has never\n> been tested, and in today's presentation you will be the first to\n> witness its potential.\"\n>\n> Bludd's voice was deep, but musical. \"We always expect the best from\n> you, Tio. If thinking machines have nightmares, no doubt you are in\n> them.\"\n>\n> The entourage chuckled, and Holtzman did his best to blush. He turned\n> toward the slaves and began issuing orders. A half dozen workers held\n> data-recording devices, positioned at important points around the\n> robot mockup.\n>\n> Plush chairs from the main residence had been arranged as seats of\n> honor. Holtzman sat beside Lord Bludd, and Norma was forced to stand\n> by the\n>\n> door. Her mentor appeared confident and intense, but she knew how\n> worried he really was. A failure today might dim his glory in the eyes\n> of the politically powerful nobles on Poritrin.\n>\n> The esteemed observers sat in their cumbersome chairs. Holtzman stared\n> at the generator setup, glancing around as if offering a quiet prayer.\n> He smiled reassuringly at Norma, then ordered the activation of the\n> prototype.\n>\n> A slave flipped a switch, as he had been taught to do. The bulky\n> generator began to hum, directing its invisible beam toward the robot\n> construction.\n>\n> \"If put to practical use,\" Holtzman said with the faintest of quavers,\n> \"we will find ways to make the generator more compact, more easily\n> installed on small ships.\"\n>\n> \"Or we can just build bigger ships,\" Bludd said, with a deep chortle.\n>\n> The hum grew louder, a vibrating rattle that made Norma's teeth\n> chatter.\n>\n> She noticed a thin sheen of perspiration on Holtzman's brow.\n>\n> \"Look, you can see it already.\" The scientist pointed. The targeted\n> robot began to shake, its metal limbs jostling and torso vibrating.\n> \"The effect will continue to build.\"\n>\n> Bludd was delighted. \"That robot is regretting he ever turned against\n> the human race, isn't he!\"\n>\n> The facsimile robot began to shimmer cherry red, its metal heating up\n> as the alloys were attuned to the destructive field projected upon it.\n> Glowing brighter, it shifted to yellow mixed with patches of blinding\n> white.\n>\n> \"By now, a real robot would have been destroyed internally,\" Holtzman\n> said, finally looking content.\n>\n> Abruptly the laboratory's heavy ceiling girders started to rattle, a\n> secondary resonance fed from the targeted robot into the dome's\n> structural framework.\n>\n> The thick walls rumbled and shuddered. A high-pitched hum shrieked\n> through the structure.\n>\n> Norma cried, \"The resonance field is bleeding over.\"\n>\n> Ceiling girders clenched like angry snakes. A crack opened in the\n> dome.\n>\n> \"Shut it off!\" Holtzman shouted, but the terrified slaves scrambled to\n> a corner of the room, as far from the generator as they could get.\n>\n> The robot mockup undulated and twisted, its body core melting. Support\n> struts that held it inside the targeting zone buckled. The\n> ominous-looking combat machine lurched forward then abruptly fell and\n> shattered into blackened metal.\n>\n> Holtzman grabbed Niko Bludd's sleeve. \"My Lord, please hurry across\n> the bridge to my main quarters. We seem to have a . . . slight\n> problem.\"\n>\n> The other nobles were already pelting across the high-tension bridge.\n> Norma was swept along with them. She took one look behind her and saw\n> that the Zenshiite slaves were uncertain what to do. Tio Holtzman gave\n> them no guidance as he retreated over the walkway right behind Bludd.\n>\n> From safety, Norma watched six panicked slaves stumble onto the\n> bridge. Remaining behind, the dark-haired leader pushed them forward,\n> shouting in their odd language. The walkway began to whip up and down\n> as resonance from the projector coupled to the bridge's connecting\n> metal.\n>\n> The bearded Zenshiite leader howled at them again. Norma wished she\n> could rescue those unfortunate, confused people. Couldn't the Dragoon\n> guards do anything? Holtzman remained speechless on this side of the\n> bluff, paralyzed with shock.\n>\n> Before the first batch of slaves could cross, the suspension walkway\n> snapped in the middle, dropping open in a screeching groan of agonized\n> metal. The hapless victims plummeted two hundred meters to the base of\n> the bluff and into the river.\n>\n> Standing on the threshold, separated now by the gulf between the\n> cliffs, the black-bearded leader cursed again. Behind him, a section\n> of the vaulted roof crashed down, destroying the prototype generator\n> and finally stopping the relentless pulse.\n>\n> Dust settled. A few flames and a curl of smoke rose into the air\n> amidst the wailing of injured men still trapped within the collapsed\n> building.\n>\n> Norma felt sick. Beside her, Holtzman sweated profusely and lookedill.\n> He blinked again and again, then wiped his forehead. His skin was\n> gray.\n>\n> In a wry voice, Bludd said, \"Not one of your most successful efforts,\n> Tio.\"\n>\n> \"But you must admit, the concept shows promise, Lord Bludd. Look at\n> the destructive potential,\" Holtzman said, looking at the unruffled\n> nobles without even considering the dead and injured slaves. \"We can\n> be thankful at least that no one was hurt.\"\n\n*Science: The creation of dilemmas by the solution of mysteries.*\n\n--- NORMA CENVA,\n\nunpublished laboratory notebooks\n\n> **I**nside the broken demonstration dome, the bloodstains washed away\n> easily, but deeper scars remained. While a crew of new slaves cleared\n> the rubble, Tio Holtzman crossed a temporary and none-too-sturdy\n> walkway. He looked sadly at the ruins of his laboratory.\n>\n> From where he worked, Bel Moulay, the bearded leader of the Zenshiite\n> slaves, glowered at the callous inventor. He hated the Poritrin man's\n> pale skin, square-cut hair, and arrogantly colorful clothes. The\n> scientist's frivolous badges of honor meant nothing to Bel Moulay, and\n> all the captive Zenshiites were offended that such a useless, deluded\n> man could flaunt his wealth while stepping on the faithful.\n>\n> In a deep voice the bearded leader gave instructions and consolation\n> to his fellows. Moulay had always been more than just the strongest\n> among them; he was also a religious leader, trained on IV Anbus in the\n> strictest laws of the Zenshiite interpretation of Buddislam. He had\n> learned the true scriptures and sutras, had analyzed every passage;\n> the other slaves looked to Bel Moulay to interpret for them.\n>\n> Despite his faith, he was as helpless as his companions, forced to\n> serve at the whim of nonbelievers. The infidels refused to let\n> Zenshiites live according to their strictures, but insisted on\n> dragging them into their hopeless war against the unholy machine\n> demons. It was a terrible punishment, a set of karmic tribulations\n> visited upon them by Buddallah.\n>\n> But they would see it through, and eventually emerge stronger. . . .\n>\n> Under Bel Moulay's guidance, the slaves moved rubble, uncovering the\n> crushed bodies of companions who had worked alongside them, fellow\n>\n> Zenshiites captured when Tlulaxa slavers raided the canyon cities on\n> IV Anbus.\n>\n> Buddallah would eventually show them the way to freedom. At story\n> fires, the bearded leader had promised that the oppressors would be\n> punished--- if not in this generation, then in the next, or the next.\n> But it would happen. A mere man like Bel Moulay had no business trying\n> to hurry the wishes of God.\n>\n> With excited shouts, two slaves shifted a fallen section of wall to\n> uncover a man who still clung to life, though his legs had been\n> crushed and his torso slashed by shards of windowplaz. Preoccupied,\n> Holtzman came over and scrutinized the injured man. \"I am no medical\n> practitioner, but there seems to be little hope.\"\n>\n> Bel Moulay glowered at him with dark, penetrating eyes. \"Nevertheless,\n> we must do what we can,\" he said in Galach. Three Zenshiite workers\n> scooped away the debris and carried the injured man across the rickety\n> walkway. Inside the slave quarters, healers would work on the\n> injuries.\n>\n> After the accident, Holtzman had provided basic medical supplies,\n> though a similar effort had done little to keep a fever from sweeping\n> through the slave population. The scientist supervised the workers in\n> the rubble, but he was intent on his own priorities.\n>\n> With a frown, the Savant gestured impatiently at the slaves picking up\n> chunks of the collapsed ceiling to uncover victims. \"You and you,\n> leave off digging out bodies for now and excavate what's left of my\n> device.\"\n>\n> The sullen captives looked at Moulay for guidance. He simply shook his\n> head. \"There is no value in resistance now,\" he muttered in their\n> private language. \"But I promise you the time will come.\"\n>\n> Later, during their meager sleep time, they would remove their dead\n> and provide proper Zenshiite blessings and passage preparations for\n> the souls. Burning the bodies of the faithful was not something their\n> religion accepted easily, but it was the way of Poritrin. Bel Moulay\n> was certain Buddallah\n>\n> could not fault them for not following traditional rules, when they\n> had no choice in the matter.\n>\n> His deity could be an angry one, though. Moulay hoped to live long\n> enough to see vengeance strike these oppressors, even if it must be in\n> the form of thinking machines.\n>\n> As the demonstration dome was cleared, Holtzman began chattering to\n> himself, planning new experiments and tests. He considered acquiring\n> more slaves to make up for recent losses.\n>\n> In all, twelve slaves were recovered from the demonstration dome,\n> while those who had fallen to their deaths from the walkway had\n> already been gathered from the river and disposed of by public\n> cremation teams. Bel Moulay knew every one of their names, and he\n> would make sure the Zenshiites chanted continual prayers for them.

Listening closely, but afraid to ask questions or call\n> attention to himself, Iblis had heard accounts of how the machines\n> first conquered, and then lost, Giedi Prime. The resilient humans had\n> driven the machines out, killing the Titan Barbarossa and destroying a\n> new Omnius.\n>\n> An incredible achievement. But how? What had they done to attain such\n> a victory? What sort of leaders did they have? And how could he do the\n> same here?\n>\n> Groggy and tired, Iblis stirred.

Every day was the same, and the thinking machines could live\n> for thousands of years. How much could *he* accomplish in only a\n> meager human lifespan?\n>\n> But Iblis took heart from the words of the Cogitor:*Nothingis\n> impossible*.\n>\n> He flicked open his eyes, intending to gauge the impending sunrise.\n> Instead, he saw a distorted reflection, a curved plexiplaz wall,\n> pinkish organic\n>\n> contours suspended in a container of energy-charged fluid.\n>\n> He sat up abruptly. The Cogitor Eklo rested on the floorboards of his\n> veranda. Beside the canister sat the big monk, Aquim, rocking back and\n> forth, eyes closed, meditating in a semuta trance.\n>\n> \"What are you doing here?\" Iblis demanded in a hushed voice. Fear\n> clenched his throat. \"If the cymeks find you in the camp, they---\"\n>\n> Aquim opened his bleary eyes. \"Trustee humans are not the only ones\n> who have an understanding with the Titans, and with Omnius. Eklo\n> wishes to speak with you directly.\"\n>\n> Swallowing hard, Iblis looked from the enlarged brain suspended in its\n> electrafluid to the haggard-looking monk. \"What does he want?\"\n>\n> \"Eklo wishes to tell you of earlier abortive human revolts.\" Holding a\n> hand against the preservation canister, he stroked the smooth surface,\n> as if picking up vibrations. \"Have you ever heard of the Hrethgir\n> Rebellions?\"\n>\n> Iblis looked around furtively. He saw none of Omnius's watcheyes.\n> \"That isn't the sort of history slaves are allowed to know, even a\n> crew boss at my level.\"\n>\n> The secondary leaned forward, his brows hooded. He spoke of things he\n> had learned, without connecting directly through the electrafluid to\n> the Cogitor's thoughts. \"Bloody rebellions occurred after the Titans\n> had converted themselves to cymeks, but before Omnius awakened.\n> Feeling themselves immortal, the cymeks became exceedingly brutal.\n> Especially the one called Ajax, who was so vicious in his torment of\n> the surviving humans that his mate Hecate left him and disappeared.\"\n>\n> Iblis said, \"Ajax hasn't changed much over the centuries.\"\n>\n> Aquim's red-rimmed eyes glowed. Eklo's brain trembled inside its\n> nutrient solution. \"Because of the excessive brutality of Ajax,\n> oppressed humans began a rebellion, mainly on Walgis but spreading to\n> Corrin and Richese.\n>\n> The slaves rose up and destroyed two of the original Titans, Alexander\n> and Tamerlane.\n>\n> \"The cymeks responded with a swift and decisive crackdown. Ajax took\n> great delight in closing off Walgis and then methodically\n> exterminating every living human there. Billions were slaughtered.\"\n>\n> Iblis struggled to think. This Cogitor had come all the way from his\n> high tower to see him. The magnitude of such a gesture stunned him.\n> \"Are you telling me that a revolt against the machines is possible, or\n> that it is doomed to failure?\"\n>\n> The big monk extended a rough hand to grab Iblis's wrist. \"Eklo will\n> tell you himself.\"\n>\n> Iblis felt a rush of anxiety, but before he could resist, Aquim\n> pressed the work leader's fingertips into the viscous electrafluid\n> surrounding the Cogitor's ancient brain. The slick solution felt icy\n> cold to Iblis, then hot. The skin on his hand tingled, as if a\n> thousand tiny spiders ran along his flesh.\n>\n> Suddenly he could sense thoughts, words, and impressions flowing\n> directly into his mind from Eklo. \"The revolt failed, but oh what a\n> glorious attempt!\"\n>\n> Iblis received another message, this one wordless, but it conveyed\n> meaning nonetheless, like an epiphany. It was as if the majesty of the\n> universe had opened to him, so many things he had not previously\n> understood . . . so many things Omnius kept the slaves from knowing.\n> Feeling great calm, he immersed his hand deeper into the liquid. His\n> fingertips touched the Cogitor's tissue, ever so gently.\n>\n> \"You are not alone.\" Eklo's words reverberated to his very soul. \"I\n> can help. Aquim can help.\"\n>\n> For several moments, Iblis gazed toward the horizon as the golden sun\n> rose, casting light on enslaved Earth. Now he did not view this story\n> of a failed\n>\n> rebellion as a warning, but as a sign of hope. A better-organized\n> revolt might succeed, given proper guidance and proper planning.

The revelation brought a\n> fervor to his heart. The monk Aquim seemed to share the same passion\n> behind his semuta-dazed expression.\n>\n> \"Nothing is impossible,\" Eklo repeated.\n>\n> Amazed, Iblis removed his hand from the charged fluid and stared at\n> his fingers. The big monk picked up the Cogitor's brain canister and\n> sealed it.

Do you think we are perfect?\"\n>\n> \"Do you think that emulating humans will make us more perfect?\"\n>\n> Though the evermind would derive no meaning from it, Erasmus shaped\n> his pliable, reflective face into a scowl. \"Yes . . .

On this cloudy\n> afternoon, artisans crafted scrollwork around the windows, and new\n> alcoves were being constructed in the building's facade, so that\n> Erasmus could install additional statues as well as more colorful\n> flowerboxes, since Serena Butler enjoyed tending them so much.\n>\n> On this high balcony he loomed over the docile humans. Some laborers\n> glanced up at him, then bent more diligently to their tasks, as if\n> afraid he might punish them or--- worse--- single them out for his\n> horrific laboratory projects.\n>\n> Erasmus continued his conversation with the evermind. \"Surely some of\n> my experiments intrigue you, Omnius, just a little?\"\n>\n> \"You know the answer to that.\"\n>\n> Erasmus said, \"Yes, the experiment to test the loyalty of your human\n> subjects is proceeding nicely. I have delivered cryptic messages to a\n> handful\n>\n> of trustee candidates--- I prefer not to reveal exactly how many---\n> suggesting that they join the brewing rebellion against you.\"\n>\n> \"There is no brewing rebellion against me.\"\n>\n> \"Of course not. And if the trustees are completely loyal to you, they\n> will never consider such a possibility. On the other hand, if they\n> were genuinely faithful to your rule, then they would have reported my\n> incendiary messages immediately. Therefore, I presume you have\n> received reports from my test subjects?\"\n>\n> For a long moment, Omnius hesitated. \"I will recheck my records.\"\n>\n> Erasmus watched the diligent artisans in the plaza, then crossed the\n> upper-level halls of his villa to the other side of the great house.\n> He looked out toward the miserable fenced-in compounds and breeding\n> pens from which he drew his experimental subjects.\n>\n> A long time ago, he had raised a subset of captives under these\n> conditions, treating them like animals to see how it would affect\n> their much-vaunted \"human spirit.\" Not surprisingly, within a\n> generation or two they had lost all semblance of civilized behavior,\n> morals, familial duty, and dignity.\n>\n> Erasmus said, \"When we imposed a caste system upon humans on the\n> Synchronized Worlds, you attempted to make them more regimented and\n> machinelike.\" He scanned the dirty, noisy crowds inside the slave\n> pens. \"While the caste system fit them within certain categories, we\n> perpetuated a model of human behavior that allowed them to see how\n> other members of their own race are different. It is the nature of\n> mankind to strive for things they do not have, to steal the rewards\n> that another person might win. To be envious of another's\n> circumstances.\"\n>\n> He focused his optic threads on the lovely ocean view beyond the\n> filthy slave pens, the churning blue-and-white surf at the base of the\n> slope. He swept his mirrored face up so that he could focus on\n> seagulls in the sky. Such images matched his programmed aesthetics\n> more closely than the dirty, fenced compound.\n>\n> Erasmus continued, \"Your most privileged human beings, such as the\n> current son of Agamemnon, hold the highest position among their kind.\n> They are our reliable pets, occupying a rung between sentient\n> biologicals and thinking machines. From this pool we draw candidates\n> for conversion into neo-cymeks.\"\n>\n> The watcheye buzzed close to the robot's polished head. Through the\n> flying device, Omnius said, \"I know all this.\"\n>\n> Erasmus continued as if he hadn't heard. \"And the caste below the\n> trustees includes civilized and educated humans, skilled thinkers and\n> creators, such as the architects who design the Titans' interminable\n> monuments. We rely on them to perform sophisticated tasks, such as\n> those being completed by artisans and craftsmen at my villa. Just\n> beneath them are my household staff, my cooks, and landscapers.\"\n>\n> The robot scanned the slave pens and realized that such appalling\n> ugliness made him want to go back to his flower gardens to wander\n> among the carefully cultivated species. Serena Butler had already done\n> wonders with the plants. She had an intuitive understanding of\n> gardening.\n>\n> \"Admittedly, those wretches down there in my pens are good for little\n> more than breeding new offspring or for dissection in medical\n> experiments.\"\n>\n> Erasmus was like Serena in a sense: he frequently needed to prune and\n> weed the human race in his own garden.\n>\n> \"I hasten to add,\" the robot said, \"that humankind as a whole is of\n> supreme value to us. Irreplaceable.\"\n>\n> \"I have heard your argument before,\" Omnius mused as the watcheye\n> drifted higher, for a broader view. \"Though machines could perform\n> every task you have enumerated, nevertheless I have accepted the\n> loyalty of my human subjects, and I have granted some of them\n> privileges.\"\n>\n> \"Your arguments do not seem . . .\" Erasmus hesitated, because the word\n> he had in mind would be a supreme insult to a computer. *Logical*.\n>\n> Omnius said, \"All humans, with their strange penchant for religious\n> beliefs and faith in things incomprehensible, should pray that your\n> experiments prove me right about human nature, and not you.

Ishmael knew it was not yet time for the\n> slaves' brief morning break.\n>\n> With narrowed eyes, the supervisor scanned the labor gang, as if\n> mentally making selections. He pointed to a handful of the youngest\n> planters, Ishmael among them, and instructed them to slosh their way\n> back to a staging area on dry land. \"Get yourselves cleaned up.

He has a plan.\"\n>\n> Ishmael hunkered down. His belly was full with strange, bland food,\n> but it nourished him. As much as he resented his new master, the boy\n> did prefer working here, rather than on the awful mudflats.\n>\n> Bel Moulay called them all to prayer in a firm, gruff voice, then\n> intoned sacred sutras in a language that Ishmael's grandfather had\n> employed, an arcane tongue understood only by the most devout. In that\n> way, they could converse without being understood by eavesdropping\n> masters.\n>\n> \"Our people have waited for vengeance,\" Moulay said. \"We were free,\n> then captured. Some of us are new slaves, while others have served the\n> evil men for generations.\" His eyes were fiery, his teeth very white\n> against dark lips and a black beard. \"But God has given us our minds\n> and our belief. It is up to us to find the weapons and the necessary\n> resolve.\"\n>\n> The muttering among the Zenshiites made Ishmael uncomfortable.\n>\n> Bel Moulay seemed to be advocating outright revolt, a violent uprising\n> against the masters. To Ishmael, that did not seem what Buddallah\n> would have preached.\n>\n> Sitting together, the IV Anbus slaves made whispered threats of\n> retribution. Moulay talked of the disastrous alloy-resonator test that\n> had caused the deaths of seventeen innocent slaves.\n>\n> \"We have suffered countless indignities,\" Moulay said. The slaves\n> growled their agreement. \"We do everything our masters require of us.\n> They reap the benefits of what we accomplish, but the Zenshiites\"---\n> he looked quickly at Ishmael and the other new additions to the\n> group---\"as well as our Zensunni brothers, never attain our freedom.\"\n> He leaned forward as if dark thoughts were coursing his mind. \"The\n> answer is in our grasp.\"\n>\n> Ishmael remembered that his grandfather had taught philosophical and\n> nonviolent methods of solving problems. Even so, old Weyop had been\n> unable to save his villagers. The pacifistic Zensunni ways had failed\n> them all, at a time of utmost crisis.\n>\n> Bel Moulay raised a callused fist, as if he intended to thrust it into\n> the crackling fire. \"We have been told by men who call themselves\n> 'righteous slavers' that they have no compunction against pressing\n> *our people* into work. They claim we owe a debt to humanity because\n> we refused to participate in their foolish war against the machine\n> demons--- demons that they had created and thought they controlled.\n> But after centuries of oppression, the people of Poritrin owe *us*.\n> And that is a debt which must be paid in blood.\"\n>\n> Aliid cheered, but beside him Ishmael sat uneasily. He did not agree\n> with the approach, but was unable to offer an alternative.

Your most expensive. What is it?\"\n>\n> The bartender laughed. \"That would be water, sir. Water is the most\n> valuable drink on Arrakis.\"\n>\n> The bartender named a price that was higher than Keedair would expect\n> to pay for supercharged spacecraft fuel. \"For *water*?

His plans began to crumble. In addition to the expense\n> of bringing his teams here to Arrakis, his raiders would have to scour\n> the desert just to drag a few sand rats back to market. Keedair sighed\n> and took a long drink of spice beer. Probably not worth the effort.\n> He'd be better off hitting Harmonthep again, even if it made him look\n> bad to other slavers.\n>\n> \"Course, there could be more of them than we realize,\" the bartender\n> said. \"They all look the same wrapped up in desert clothes.\"\n>\n> As Keedair savored the liquor, a tingle went through his body, not\n> quite euphoria, but a rush of well-being.

It didn't matter where the merchandise came from.\n>\n> \"And what about this spice beer?\" He tapped his nearly empty glass\n> with a stubby fingernail. \"Where do the Zensunnis find ingredients?\n> Doesn't seem to me that anything could grow out there at all.\"\n>\n> \"Spice is a natural substance in the desert. You can find patches out\n> in the dunes, exposed by the wind or spice blows. But monster\n> sandworms live out there, and fierce storms that'll kill you. Let the\n> Zensunnis have the place, if you ask me. The nomads bring in loads of\n> the stuff to Arrakis City, for bartering.\"\n>\n> Keedair considered taking samples of melange back to the League\n> Worlds. Would there be a market for it on rich Salusa, or among the\n> nobles on Poritrin? The substance certainly had an unusual effect on\n> the body . . .\n>\n> soothing in a way he had never experienced before. If he could sell\n> it, he might offset some of the cost of this exploration trip.\n>\n> The bartender nodded toward the door. \"I don't get enough spice beer\n> that I can sell to you as a middleman, but a band of nomads came in\n> this morning. They'll stay inside their tents during the heat of the\n> day, but you'll find them in the market in the evening, on the east\n> end of the spaceport. They'll sell you whatever they have. Just be\n> sure they don't cheat you.\"\n>\n> \"Nobody cheats me,\" Keedair said, revealing his sharp teeth in a cruel\n> grin.\n>\n> He noticed, though, that his words came out alarmingly slurred.\n>\n> He would have to let the spice beer wear off before he met with the\n> Zensunni.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> AWNINGS OF BROWN-AND-WHITE fabric offered patches of shade. The nomads\n> sat by themselves, separated from the bustle of the spaceport. These\n> Zensunnis had constructed tents and shelters from scavenged tarpaulins\n> and cargo wrappings. Some of the fabrics appeared to be made from a\n> different kind of polymer, an odd sort of plastic unlike anything\n> Keedair had seen before.\n>\n> The sun fell behind the barricade of mountains, leaving the sky awash\n> with orange pastels and fire hues. A wind came in as the temperature\n> dropped, bringing dust and stinging sand.

Noticing him, two hopeful women\n> went into their stores to haul out items for sale, spreading them on a\n> flat tabletop. One man stood near them, his lean face tattooed with a\n> geometric symbol, his eyes dark and suspicious.\n>\n> Without saying a word, Keedair allowed the women to display their\n> colorful cloths, along with odd-shaped rocks that had been scoured in\n> sandstorms and a few laughably corroded items of long-forgotten\n> technology that Keedair could never sell to even the most gullible and\n> eccentric antique collector. He shook his head gruffly each time until\n> the lean man--- whom one of the women referred to as Naib Dhartha---\n> said he had nothing else.\n>\n> Keedair got to the point. \"I've tasted spice beer. The man who sold it\n> to me suggested I talk to you.\"\n>\n> \"Spice beer,\" Dhartha said. \"Made from melange. Yes, it is\n> obtainable.\" \"How much can you deliver, and what would it cost me?\"\n>\n> The naib spread his hands and revealed a hint of a smile. \"Everything\n> is open to discussion. The price depends on the amount you desire.\n> Enough for a month of personal use?\"\n>\n> \"Why not a cargo ship full?\" Keedair said, noting shock on the faces\n> of the nomads.\n>\n> Dhartha recovered himself quickly. \"That will take time to gather. A\n> month, maybe two.\"\n>\n> \"I can wait--- if we reach an agreement. I've come here with an empty\n> vessel. I need to take something back with me.\" He looked down at the\n> scavenged objects and the wind-scoured art rocks. \"And I certainly\n> don't want to carry anything like *that*. I'd be the laughingstock of\n> the League.\"\n>\n> Despite a natural Tlulaxa interest in biological products, Keedair was\n> not wedded to the business of slavery. He would go his own way and\n> never return to the Thalim solar system, if necessary. Many of the\n> Tlulaxa were religious fanatics anyway, and he grew tired of their\n> dogma and politics. Drugs and drink would always be in demand, and if\n> he could introduce something new and exotic, a drug the richest nobles\n> had never tried, he might turn a handy profit.\n>\n> \"But first tell me exactly what melange is,\" Keedair continued. \"Where\n> does it come from?\"\n>\n> Dhartha gestured to one of the women, who ducked under the sheltered\n> overhang. A hot breeze picked up, and the polymer fabric flapped\n> louder than before. The sun had settled toward the horizon, forcing\n> him to squint as he looked in that direction. This prevented him from\n> reading nuances in the desert man's expression.\n>\n> Within moments, the woman brought out small, steaming cups of a rich\n> black liquid that smelled of pungent cinnamon spice. She served\n> Keedair first, and he looked down, curious but skeptical.\n>\n> \"Coffee mixed with pure melange,\" Dhartha said. \"You will enjoy it.\"\n>\n> Keedair recalled how expensive water had been in the bar and decided\n> that this nomad was investing in their conversation. He took a sip,\n> cautious at first, but could think of no reason why the fellow might\n> poison him. He tasted the hot coffee on his tongue and felt an\n> electric sensation, a delicious taste that reminded him of the spice\n> beer he still had in his system. He would need to be careful, or he\n> would lose his business edge.\n>\n> \"We harvest melange out in the Tanzerouft, the deep desert where the\n> demon sandworms go. It is very dangerous there. We lose many of our\n> people, but the spice is precious.\"\n>\n> Keedair took another drink of coffee and had to stop himself from\n> agreeing too readily. His assessment of the possibilities grew. Now,\n> as the two men shifted positions, Keedair could look upon Dhartha's\n> lean face. The Naib's eyes were not just dark; they were deep blue.\n> Even the whites had taken on a strange indigo tinge. Most odd. He\n> wondered if it could be an unusual defect caused by Zensunni\n> inbreeding.\n>\n> The desert man reached into one of his pockets and withdrew a small\n> box, which he opened to display a compressed, flaky brown powder. He\n> extended it toward Keedair, who stirred the contents with the tip of\n> his little finger.\n>\n> \"Pure melange. Very potent. We use it in our beverages and meals back\n> in the cave villages.\"\n>\n> Keedair touched the spice-speckled tip of his finger to his tongue.\n> The melange was strong and exhilarating, yet soothing. He felt\n> energetic and calm at the same time. His mind seemed sharper, not\n> fuzzed the way excessive alcohol or drugs affected him. But he held\n> back, not wishing to appear overly anxious.\n>\n> \"And if you consume melange over a long period of time,\" Dhartha was\n> saying, \"it helps you retain your health, keeps you young.\"\n>\n> Keedair made no comment. He had heard similar claims about various\n> \"fountain of youth\" substances. None of them, in his experience, had\n> ever proven effective.\n>\n> He snicked shut the cover of the small box and put it in his own\n> pocket, though it had not been offered to him as a gift. He stood. \"I\n> will come back tomorrow. Then we shall talk more. I need to consider\n> this matter.\"\n>\n> The desert naib grunted in affirmation.\n>\n> Keedair walked toward his shuttle within the parking perimeter of the\n> spaceport. His mind spun with preliminary calculations. His fellow\n> slavers would be disappointed at not even attempting a raid, but\n> Keedair would pay them the minimum required by contract. He needed to\n> ponder the possibilities of this potent spice before discussing a\n> price with the nomads. Arrakis was far, far from normal space trading\n> routes. The idea excited him, but he wasn't certain he could\n> profitably export the exotic substance.\n>\n> Realistically, he doubted if melange would ever be more than a mere\n> curiosity.\n>\n> *Humans are survivors.

He had\n> furnished this room for his business meetings with drug prospectors,\n> biochemists, and pharmaceutical merchants, but Zufa Cenva sometimes\n> used it for her own private meetings.\n>\n> Even in the late darkness, the chief Sorceress was out in the\n> dangerous jungles, training her young prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and preparing them for\n> suicide attacks. Venport did not know whether Zufa was eager or afraid\n> for her volunteers to be called again.\n>\n> He very much hoped his mate didn't get ideas of her own, though she\n> would probably love to make herself a martyr. Zufa took him for\n> granted, blamed him for his imagined failings, but still Venport cared\n> for the cold, pale Sorceress. He didn't want to lose her.\n>\n> Zufa had been due back more than an hour ago, and he'd been waiting\n> for her. It did him no good to be impatient, though. The haughty\n> Sorceress operated on her own schedule, considering his priorities\n> unimportant.\n>\n> Even in the darkest night, the cave room was illuminated by warm,\n> comforting light--- a glowing yellow sphere that floated gracefully\n> above the table like a portable, personal sun. Dear Norma had sent it\n> to him from Poritrin as a gift, a compact light source levitated by a\n> new suspensor field she had developed. Based on the same principle as\n> a glowpanel, but much more efficient, the device generated\n> illumination as a by-product of the suspensor field itself. Norma\n> called it a glowglobe, and he'd been considering its commercial\n> possibilities.\n>\n> Venport took a long drink of bitter herbal ale from a goblet in front\n> of him. He grimaced, then drank some more, trying to bolster his\n> nerve. Zufa should be here any minute, and he was anxious to see her.\n> Out in the jungles the Sorceresses had erected a shrine to honor\n> fallen Heoma. Maybe they were all there now, dancing around it under\n> the starlight, chanting incantations like witches. Or maybe--- despite\n> their cool, agnostic logic and determination--- they chose private\n> moments to worship a Gaia life force, an Earth mother that embodied\n> feminine power. Anything to set them apart from what they considered\n> to be \"weakling\" men . . .\n>\n> Beckoned by the glowglobe, nightbugs flew into the room from the outer\n> corridors. The nocturnal insects had a voracious appetite for human\n> blood, but only men were bothered. It was one of the jokes of Rossak,\n> as if the Sorceresses had cast some sort of a spell on the tiny\n> creatures to keep their men inside during the evenings, while women\n> performed secret rites out in the jungles.\n>\n> Another quarter of an hour passed, and still Zufa did not join him.\n> Frustrated with her, Venport finished the ale and set the empty goblet\n> on the opalwood table, heaving a disgusted sigh. He rarely asked to\n> see her, but this was important to him. Couldn't she give him just a\n> few moments of her precious time?\n>\n> Still, he would continue to seek her understanding and respect. For\n> years, Venport had enjoyed substantial success in exporting medical\n> narcotics and pharmaceuticals manufactured from Rossak plants. In the\n> past month, his men had turned a large profit from the sale of\n> psychedelics to Yardin. The drugs had become a favorite of the\n> Buddislamic mystics who ran the place. The mystics used the Rossak\n> hallucinogen in religious rituals, attempting to attain enlightenment.\n>\n> Venport stared at a large, milky soostone on the table. A smuggler\n> from Buzzell, one of the Unallied Planets, had sold him the extremely\n> rare and valuable stone. The dealer had claimed that some soostones of\n> extraordinary purity possessed hypnotic focusing abilities. He wanted\n> Zufa\n>\n> to wear it with pride, perhaps on a pendant. The Sorceress could use\n> it to make herself stronger.\n>\n> He inserted a rolled slip of alkaloid bark into his mouth and crunched\n> down, knowing it would make him relax. He dimmed the glowglobe and\n> adjusted its spectrum to a more orange light, which caused the\n> soostone to dance with rainbow colors. The alkaloid bark made him feel\n> tingly, calm . . . and distant. The uncommon stone shimmered\n> hypnotically, and he lost track of time.\n>\n> When Zufa entered the room, her pale face was flushed, her eyes\n> bright. She looked like an ethereal creature in the room's rich glow.\n> She wore a long diaphanous gown with tiny jewels sparkling across it\n> like a field of ruby flowers.\n>\n> \"I see you have nothing important to do,\" she said, already frowning.\n>\n> He gathered his wits about him. \"Nothing more important than waiting\n> for you.\" Rising to his feet with all the pride he could muster, he\n> picked up the soostone. \"I found this, and I thought of you. A gift\n> from Buzzell, where my merchants made an extraordinary profit from---\"\n> Noticing an expression of disdain on her face, Venport felt flustered.\n> His voice trailed off.\n>\n> \"And what am I supposed to do with it?\" She examined the offering,\n> without touching it. \"When have I ever cared for pretty baubles?\"\n>\n> \"It's a rare soostone, said to have certain . . . telepathic\n> enhancement characteristics. Perhaps you can use it as a focusing\n> device when you instruct your trainees?\" She stood like a statue,\n> unimpressed, and he continued in a rush, \"The Buddislamics on Yardin\n> are clamoring for our psychedelics. I've made a lot of credits in the\n> past few months, and I thought this was something you might\n> appreciate.\"\n>\n> \"I'm tired and I'm going to bed,\" she said, letting him keep the\n> present. \"My Sorceresses have already proven their abilities. With\n> machines still threatening every League world, we don't have time to\n> stare into soostones.\"\n>\n> He shook his head. What would it have cost her merely to accept his\n> gift? Could she not at least have offered him a word of kindness? Hurt\n> so deeply that even the calming bark could not soothe him, Venport\n> shouted, \"If we give up our humanity to fight the machines, Zufa, then\n> Omnius has already won!\"\n>\n> She hesitated just a moment, but did not turn back to him. Instead,\n> she went to her chambers and left him standing alone.\n>\n> *In surviving, shall our humanity endure? That which makes life sweet\n> for the living--- warm and filled with beauty--- this, too, must be.\n> But we shall not gain this enduring humanity if we deny our whole\n> being--- if we deny emotion, thought, and flesh. If we deny emotion,\n> we lose all touch with our universe. By denying thought, we cannot\n> reflect upon what we touch. And if we dare deny the flesh, we unwheel\n> the vehicle that carries us all.*\n\n--- PRIMERO VORIAN ATREIDES,\n\n*Annals of the Army of the Jihad*\n\n> **E**arth. In a drizzle of summer rain, Vorian rode inside an\n> exquisite white coach, drawn by four prancing white stallions. Erasmus\n> had ordered the robot coachman to wear a uniform with broad military\n> lapels, dripping golden ribbons and a tricorner hat taken from an\n> ancient historical image.\n>\n> The extravagance was inefficient and unnecessary--- not to mention\n> anachronistic--- but the human trustee had heard that eccentric\n> Erasmus often did inexplicable things. Vor could not imagine why such\n> an important representative of the evermind would want to see *him*.\n>\n> Perhaps Erasmus had studied some of the simulations and war games\n> Vorian had played with Seurat. He knew that the robot had built\n> extensive laboratories to research the questions about human nature\n> that plagued his inquisitive mind. *But what could I possibly tell\n> him?*\n>\n> As the carriage wheels clattered over cobblestones in front of the\n> manor house, Vor wiped fog from the window. Even in the rain, the\n> imposing Grogyptian-style villa was more magnificent than the\n> efficient grid-organized cities. It seemed fit for a prince.\n>\n> With ornamental gardens and enough tile-roofed buildings to comprise a\n> small village, the sprawling estate covered many acres. The\n> balcony-adorned main house featured tall fluted columns and winged\n> gargoyles that looked down on a reception plaza as large as a town\n> square crowded with\n>\n> fountains and twisted sculptures, paved gathering areas and\n> stone-walled outbuildings.\n>\n> *What am I doing here?*\n>\n> Two liveried humans approached, averting their eyes as if Vor was a\n> visiting machine dignitary. One man opened the door, while the other\n> helped him step down. \"Erasmus waits to see you.\" The white horses\n> pranced and fidgeted, perhaps because they received few opportunities\n> to exercise.\n>\n> One of the liveried men held a rain cover to shield Vor's dark hair\n> from the drizzle. Dressed in a sleeveless tunic and light trousers, he\n> shivered. He hated being drenched, and the discomfort only reminded\n> him of the flaws and weaknesses of his human body. If he were a cymek,\n> he could have easily adjusted his internal temperature, and\n> thoughtrodes could delete annoying sensual responses. *Someday*.\n>\n> Inside the entry, a beautiful young woman greeted him. \"Vorian\n> Atreides?\" She had exotic lavender eyes and a flashing independence in\n> contrast to the cowed men in livery. The barest hint of a challenging\n> smile curved her lips. \"So, you are the son of the evil Agamemnon?\"\n>\n> Taken aback, Vor drew himself up. \"My father is a revered general,\n> first among the Titans. His military exploits are legendary.\"\n>\n> \"Or infamous.\" The woman stared at him with a shocking lack of\n> respect.\n>\n> Vor didn't know how to react. Lower-caste humans on the Synchronized\n> Worlds all knew their places, and she couldn't be a trustee, like\n> himself. No other slave had ever spoken to him in such a manner. As a\n> reward after his numerous update missions, Vor had been granted the\n> services of pleasure slaves, women assigned to warm his bed. He had\n> never asked any of them their identities. \"I want to know your name\n> because I wish to remember it,\" he said, at last. He found something\n> intriguing about this exotically beautiful woman and her unexpected\n> defiance.\n>\n> She sounded as proud of her lineage as Vor was. \"I am Serena Butler.\"\n> She led him along a corridor lined with statuary and paintings, then\n> into a botanical garden shielded from the rain by a glass-paneled\n> ceiling.\n>\n> \"What do you do here? Are you one of Erasmus's . . . privileged\n> trainees?\"\n>\n> \"I am just a house slave, but unlike you, I don't serve the thinking\n> machines by choice.\"\n>\n> He took her comment as a badge of honor. \"Yes, I serve them and\n> proudly. I am helping to achieve the best that is possible for our\n> flawed species.\"\n>\n> \"By collaborating with Omnius, you are a willing traitor to your race.\n> To the free humans, you are as evil as your machine masters. Or hasn't\n> that ever occurred to you before?\"\n>\n> Vor was baffled. The human military commander at Giedi Prime had made\n> similar accusations. \"Evil . . . in what way? Can't you see the good\n> that Omnius has accomplished? It's so obvious. Simply look at the\n> Synchronized Worlds. Every detail is seen to, everything runs\n> smoothly. Why would anyone want to disrupt that?\"\n>\n> Serena gazed at him, as if trying to decide whether he truly meant\n> what he said. Finally, she shook her head. \"You are a fool, a slave\n> who cannot see his chains. It's not worth the effort to convince you.\"\n> Abruptly she turned away from him and marched ahead, leaving him\n> speechless. \"For all your supposed training, you simply don't know any\n> better.\"\n>\n> Before he could think of a suitable response, Vor noticed the\n> independent robot. Garbed in opulent robes, Erasmus stood by a shallow\n> pool, his oval face reflecting the water. Raindrops fell from an\n> opening cut through the glass ceiling, wetting him. Classical music\n> played a soothing melody in the background.\n>\n> Without announcing Vor's arrival, Serena left. Surprised by her\n> rudeness, he stared after her. He admired her face and amber-brown\n> hair, as well as her bearing and obvious intelligence. Her waist was\n> thick, and he wondered if\n>\n> she was pregnant. Paradoxically, her arrogance made her more\n> captivating, the desirability of something unattainable.\n>\n> Obviously, Serena Butler had not accepted her place as a household\n> servant. Considering the squalid lives of slaves in the unkempt pens\n> behind the villa, what did she have to complain about? It made no\n> sense.\n>\n> \"Outspoken, is she not?\" said Erasmus, still standing in the rain. The\n> robot shifted his pliable face into a congenial smile.\n>\n> Standing away from the cool drizzle, Vor said, \"I am surprised you\n> tolerate her annoying attitude.\"\n>\n> \"Attitudes can be enlightening.\" Erasmus turned back to his study of\n> the raindrops in the reflecting pool. \"I find her interesting.\n> Refreshingly honest\n>\n> --- much as you are.\" The robot took a step toward him. \"I have\n> reached an impasse in my study of human behavior because most of my\n> subjects are drawn from docile captives who have been bred to slavery.\n> They have never known any life but one of service and subjugation, and\n> do not show any *spark*. They are sheep, while you, Vorian Atreides,\n> are a wolf. And so is this Serena Butler . . . in her own way.\"\n>\n> The visitor bowed, swelling with pride. \"I am happy to assist you in\n> any manner, Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \"I trust you enjoyed the coach ride? I breed the stallions and keep\n> them groomed for important occasions. You gave me an excuse to use\n> them.\"\n>\n> \"It was an unusual experience,\" Vor admitted. \"A most . . . archaic\n> mode of transportation.\"\n>\n> \"Come stand here in the rain with me.\" Erasmus beckoned with a\n> synthetic hand. \"It is pleasant, I assure you.\"\n>\n> Vor stepped forward as he was told, trying not to show discomfort. The\n> rain quickly soaked his tunic, moistened his bare arms; water trickled\n> from his\n>\n> clumped dark hair, down his forehead and into his eyes. \"Yes, Erasmus.\n> It's . . . pleasant.\"\n>\n> The robot simulated a laugh. \"You are lying.\"\n>\n> With good humor, Vor said, \"It is what humans do best.\"\n>\n> Mercifully, the robot led them out of the rain. \"Let us discuss\n> Serena. She is attractive, according to human standards of beauty, is\n> she not?\" Vor didn't know what to say, but Erasmus pressed him, \"I\n> watched you with her. You would like to procreate with that feral\n> human, would you not? She is currently carrying the child of a\n> *hrethgir* lover, but we will have plenty of time. She is unlike any\n> simple pleasure slave you have been assigned?\"\n>\n> Vor pondered the questions, wondering what the robot really wanted to\n> know. \"Well, she is beautiful . . . and enticing.\"\n>\n> Erasmus made an artificial sound, something like a sigh. \"Sadly,\n> despite my numerous sensitive upgrades, I remain unable to experience\n> sexual activity, at least not in the way a biological male does. I\n> have spent centuries designing upgrades and modifications that might\n> replicate the sensations of ecstasy that even the lowliest human can\n> enjoy. Thus far, there has been little progress. My attempts with\n> female slaves have been alarmingly unsuccessful.\"\n>\n> Strolling along in his fine clothes, Erasmus gestured for Vor to\n> follow him through the greenhouse. As they walked down garden paths,\n> the regal machine identified various plants by name and origin, as if\n> he were lecturing a child or bragging about his knowledge. \"Serena\n> knows a great deal about plants herself. She was something of a\n> horticulturist on Salusa Secundus.\"\n>\n> Vor made polite responses, trying to guess how he could help the\n> robot. He wiped water from his eyes; his damp clothes felt clammy and\n> unpleasant.\n>\n> Finally Erasmus explained why he had summoned the young trustee.\n> \"Vorian Atreides, your father recently gave you a biological\n> life-extension\n>\n> treatment.\" The mechanical face shifted back to a smooth mirror, so as\n> not to give Vor a clue about what he wanted. \"Tell me, how do you\n> *feel* now that you have had centuries added to your lifespan? Surely,\n> it is a great gift from Agamemnon, as significant as his original\n> sperm donation.\"\n>\n> Before Vor could consider the question, Serena entered the greenhouse\n> carrying a silver tea set. She placed the tray with a rough clatter on\n> a polished stone table and poured dark liquid into two cups. She\n> handed one to Vor and one to the robot. Erasmus extruded a fibrous,\n> feathery-tipped probe into the tea, as if tasting it. His mirrored\n> mask shifted into an expression of supreme pleasure. \"Excellent,\n> Serena. A remarkable and interesting flavor!\"\n>\n> Vor did not care for the taste himself; the tea reminded him of bitter\n> chocolate mixed with spoiled fruit juices. Serena seemed amused at his\n> expression.\n>\n> \"It is good?\" Erasmus asked. \"Serena prepared it especially for you. I\n> let her choose an appropriate recipe.\"\n>\n> \"The flavor is . . . unique.\"\n>\n> The robot laughed. \"You are lying again.\"\n>\n> \"No, Erasmus. I am avoiding a direct response.\"\n>\n> Vor saw hostility in Serena's unusual eyes as she looked at him, and\n> he wondered if she had ruined the tea on purpose. Leaving the tray on\n> the stone table, she departed, saying, \"Maybe I should attend a\n> trustee school to learn how to be a better simpering servant.\"\n>\n> Vor watched Serena, surprised that Erasmus ignored her rudeness. \"It\n> amuses me to watch her attempts at resistance, Vorian. Harmless\n> defiance. She knows she can never escape.\" During a moment of silence,\n> the robot continued to study him. \"You did not answer my question\n> about the life extension.\"\n>\n> Now that he'd had time to ponder, Vor said, \"Honestly, I'm not sure\n> how I feel about it. My human body is fragile, easily damaged. Though\n> I am still prone to accidents or sickness, at least I will not grow\n> old and weak.\" Vor thought about all the years remaining to him, like\n> credits to spend. He would live several human lifespans, but becoming\n> a cymek would be so much more important. \"Even so, my extra years are\n> only the blink of an eye compared to the life of a thinking machine\n> such as yourself.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, the blink of an eye, an involuntary human reflex I can\n> understand physically and conceptually. You use it as an inexact\n> metaphor to indicate a brief period of time.\"\n>\n> Noticing watcheye screens on the greenhouse walls, Vor realized that\n> the evermind must be eavesdropping. \"Are you always this curious?\"\n>\n> \"Curiosity is how one learns,\" Erasmus said. \"I inquire because I am\n> inquisitive. That makes sense, does it not? Enlighten me. I would like\n> to speak with you again. You--- and Serena--- can give me an\n> interesting perspective.\"\n>\n> Vor bowed. \"As you wish, Erasmus. However, I must coordinate such\n> visits with my important work for Omnius. Soon the *Dream Voyager*\n> will be repaired and ready to depart on another update run.\"\n>\n> \"Yes, we all work for Omnius.\" Erasmus paused. Overhead, through the\n> murky ceiling of the greenhouse, the rain had stopped, leaving patchy\n> openings of blue sky. \"Think more about mortality and longevity. Come\n> and speak to me again before departing on your next voyage.\"\n>\n> \"I will seek permission to do so, Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> INTRIGUED BY THE fascinating interplay between the two humans, Erasmus\n> summoned Serena again and commanded her to escort their guest back to\n> his coach. She had been outwardly hostile to this son of Agamemnon,\n> while he was clearly interested in her . . . physically? . . .\n>\n> mentally? And how could one tell the difference? Another experiment,\n> perhaps?\n>\n> Even though they had exchanged few words, Vorian found his imagination\n> filled with this young woman. He had never met a female like her, with\n> such self-confident beauty, intelligence, and willingness to speak her\n> mind. Obviously Serena Butler had been raised to value herself as an\n> individual--- much as Erasmus worked hard to perfect his own\n> independence.\n>\n> Reaching the outer doorway of the villa, the young man blurted, \"When\n> is your baby due?\" At the coach, the horses seemed anxious to be off.\n> The uniformed robot driver sat like a statue.\n>\n> Serena's eyes widened with annoyance. She was about to retort that it\n> was none of his business, but she stopped short. Perhaps Vorian\n> Atreides was just the opportunity she had been hoping for. He had\n> information that might help her escape, and he had the trust of the\n> machines. It would be foolish to alienate him from the outset. If she\n> befriended him instead, might she not be able to show him what a free\n> human being could be?\n>\n> She drew a deep breath and smiled uncertainly. \"I'm not prepared to\n> discuss my baby with a complete stranger. But maybe next time you\n> come, we could talk. That might be a place to start.\" There. She had\n> done it.\n>\n> With that, she went inside the villa and carefully shut the door\n> behind her.\n>\n> As she watched the coach from the portico of the towering villa,\n> Serena Butler felt uncertain and confused about this deluded man who\n> so proudly served the machines. She didn't like him, wasn't sure she\n> could ever trust him. But perhaps he could be helpful.\n>\n> Feeling uneasy, and damp from the rain and mist in the outside air,\n> she hurried back inside to dry herself and change her clothes. With\n> the precious baby growing inside her womb, six months along now, she\n> thought of her beloved Xavier. Could Vorian help her return to him, or\n> would her child grow up in captivity, never to know its father?\n\n> *Of all the subjects of human behavior, two are most storied: warfare\n> and love.*\n>\n> --- COGITOR EKLO,\n>\n> *Ruminations on Things Lost*\n>\n> **T**he tragic loss of Serena had left Xavier off course, struggling\n> to regain the momentum of his life. Three months earlier, he had seen\n> the wreckage of her blockade runner floating in the seas of Giedi\n> Prime, and had read the indisputable DNA analysis of the blood samples\n> found inside.\n>\n> He did not claim to understand his feelings, and avoided them by\n> letting his work consume him. At first he had wanted to fling himself\n> recklessly at another machine stronghold, but Serena would have\n> scolded him for that. The thought of her disapproval was the only\n> thing that had stopped him.\n>\n> She had died fighting the inhuman enemy. Xavier needed an anchor to\n> grasp, some form of stability before moving on. For the sake of her\n> memory, the struggle must continue until every thinking machine had\n> been destroyed.\n>\n> Xavier's mind drifted to Octa, the haunting reminder of her sister.\n> Lovely in her own right, she was sensitive and introspective, rather\n> than the goal-driven crusader Serena had been. Still, in subtle ways,\n> the willowy girl reminded him achingly of Serena, in the shape of her\n> mouth and the gentle smile. It was like the echo of a pleasant memory.\n> Xavier found himself torn between staring longingly at Octa and\n> avoiding her entirely.\n>\n> She was there to comfort him when he grieved, gave him space when he\n> needed it, and cheered him when he wanted that. Quietly and gently,\n> Octa was filling a void in his life. Although their relationship\n> remained tranquil and unremarkable, she showed him attentive love.\n> Where Serena had been a storm of emotions, her sister was steady and\n> predictable.\n>\n> One day, on an impulse driven more by grief and longing than common\n> sense, Xavier asked Octa to become his wife. She had looked at him\n> with wide eyes, astonished. \"I am afraid to move, Xavier, to utter a\n> sound, because I must be dreaming.\"\n>\n> He had worn his clean and pressed Armada uniform bearing his new rank\n> insignia as Segundo. Xavier stood straight, his hands clasped, as if\n> addressing a superior officer, rather than asking Octa to join him as\n> his life mate. He had always known that Serena's sister had a girlish,\n> unrealistic infatuation with him, and now he hoped it could grow into\n> genuine love.\n>\n> \"In choosing you to marry me, dear Octa, I can think of no braver way\n> to march forward into the future. It is our best chance to honor\n> Serena's memory.\"\n>\n> The words sounded like a formal speech, but Octa flushed as if they\n> were a magical incantation. Aware that this was the wrong reason to\n> betroth himself to her, Xavier tried to dispel the uneasiness. He had\n> made up his mind and hoped that they could soothe each others' wounds.\n>\n> Both Manion and Livia Butler accepted and encouraged the shifting of\n> Xavier's affections; they even rushed the nuptials. Now the bridge\n> across an emotional chasm had been severed, and they believed the\n> match with Octa would benefit all of them.\n>\n> On the day of his wedding, Xavier searched for an inner peace, doing\n> his best to lock away the portion of his heart that would always\n> belong to Serena. He still longed for the peal of her laugh, for her\n> outspokenness, for the electric touch of her skin. Taking a few\n> private moments, he reviewed his favorite memories of her one by one\n> in his mind, and then, tearfully, set them aside.\n>\n> From now on, gentle Octa would be his wife. He would not hurt the\n> already-fragile girl by wallowing in regrets, or by comparing her to\n> her sister. That would be dishonest and unfair to her.\n>\n> A number of League representatives had gathered at the hilltop Butler\n> estate, where seven months earlier Xavier and Serena had participated\n> in the raucous bristleback hunt. Nearby, in the courtyard, they had\n> held the gala betrothal celebration filled with music and dancing---\n> but ending with the terrible news of Giedi Prime's fall.\n>\n> At Xavier's insistence, the wedding took place inside a new pavilion\n> with vistas of vineyards and olive groves. The fabric structure was so\n> resplendent and intricate in its workmanship that it cost more than a\n> modest house. Out in front, three large banners fluttered in a gentle\n> breeze, designating the households of Butler and Harkonnen, and of\n> Tantor, Xavier's adoptive family. In the valley below, the white\n> buildings of Zimia shone in sunlight, with wide avenues and large\n> administration complexes refurbished in the fourteen months since the\n> cymek attack.\n>\n> The ceremony was small and somber, despite the guests' pretenses and\n> Manion Butler's insistent merriment. New memories would supplant the\n> old ones. Smiling as he had not done in months, the Viceroy strutted\n> from guest to guest under the colorful awnings, tasting punch recipes\n> and sampling the cornucopia of cheeses and wines.\n>\n> The silent bride and groom stood by a small altar at the front of the\n> crowded tent, holding hands. Dressed in the pale-blue gown of\n> traditional Salusan weddings, Octa looked ethereal, lovely and fragile\n> beside him. Her strawberry-blond hair was held neatly in place with\n> pearl-head pins.\n>\n> Some would say this rushed marriage to Serena's sister was a reaction\n> to Xavier's grief, but he knew he was taking the honorable course. He\n> reminded himself a thousand times that Serena would have approved.\n> Together, he and Octa would bring closure to so much pain and sadness.\n>\n> Inside the flower-decked pavilion stood Abbess Livia Butler, her\n> amber-brown hair highlighted by sparkling golden strands. She had come\n> from the City of Introspection to perform the ceremony. Confident and\n> proud, as if she had purged all doubts and sorrow from her mind, Livia\n> looked at the bride and groom, then smiled at her husband. Manion\n> Butler barely fit into\n>\n> his red and gold tuxedo. Soft flesh poked out at the neck and at the\n> ends of the sleeves.\n>\n> A group of players began to strum their balisets. A boy with a sweet\n> tenor voice sang slowly. Beside Xavier, Octa seemed to be in her own\n> dreamy world, not quite certain how to react to the turn of\n> circumstances. She squeezed his hand, and he raised it to his lips and\n> kissed it.\n>\n> Ever since the death of her twin brother Fredo, Octa had developed an\n> ability to shut things out, never overwhelming herself with\n> large-scale concerns but instead preferring smaller tableaux. Such a\n> limited focus might permit her to be happy, and Xavier, too.\n>\n> Tears glistening in his expressive eyes, Viceroy Butler stepped\n> forward to clasp their hands. After a long moment he turned solemnly\n> to his wife, and nodded. Abbess Livia began to intone the ceremony.\n> \"We are here to sing a song of love, a song that has joined men and\n> women since the earliest days of civilization.\"\n>\n> As Octa smiled up at Xavier, he could almost imagine she was Serena,\n> but he drove the troubling image away. He and Octa loved each other in\n> a different way. Their bond grew stronger each time he held her in his\n> arms. Xavier had only to accept the warmth that she readily bestowed\n> on him.\n>\n> Before them, Livia spoke the traditional words, the roots of which\n> extended back to the Panchristian and Buddislamic texts of ancient\n> times. The lilting phrases were beautiful, and Xavier's mind kept\n> expanding outward, thinking forward and backward. The words were\n> infinitely calm and reassuring as Abbess Livia guided the young couple\n> through their vows.\n>\n> Soon everything necessary had been said. As he shared the ritual of\n> love and placed a ring on Octa's finger, Xavier Harkonnen pledged his\n> eternal devotion to her. Not even the thinking machines could tear\n> this relationship apart.\n>\n> *Talk is based on the assumption that you can get somewhere if you\n> keep puttingone word after another.*\n\n--- IBLIS GINJO,\n\nnotes in the margin of a stolen notebook\n\n> **A**jax strode his intimidating walker-form into the Forum Plaza,\n> inspecting every operation, searching for flaws. With his array of\n> optic threads, the Titan scanned the polished colossus that showed his\n> long-forgotten human form. Ajax was frustrated that Iblis Ginjo had\n> maintained such a careful watch that he could find no excuse to impose\n> amusing punishments. . . .\n>\n> In turmoil, Iblis watched for an opportunity of his own. His\n> imagination kept returning to the remarkable things he had learned\n> from the Cogitor Eklo, especially details of the glorious failure of\n> the Hrethgir Rebellions. Ajax personified the brutality and pain of\n> those long-ago battles.\n>\n> Could the Cogitor help Iblis to spread the quiet fires of a brewing\n> revolution? They could learn from the mistakes of the past attempts.\n> Had there ever been a rebel of trustee stature, like Iblis? And how\n> could the secondary Aquim assist him?\n>\n> Despite his subtle investigations, his ability to manipulate\n> conversations and make others unwittingly divulge their secrets, Iblis\n> had not yet found evidence of other resistance groups. Perhaps their\n> leadership was scattered, disorganized, weak. Who had sent him the\n> secret messages--- five in the past three months?\n>\n> The lack of evidence frustrated Iblis, because he wanted to push the\n> uprising forward, now that he had made up his mind. On the other hand,\n> if the dissenters were too easily found, they would have no chance\n> against the organized thinking machines.\n>\n> After pushing his slaves particularly hard and finishing his assigned\n> labors, Iblis asked to take another pilgrimage to Eklo's stone tower.\n> Only the\n>\n> Cogitor could give him the answers he needed. When he spoke with the\n> administrative cymek Dante, showing records that demonstrated his\n> productivity and efficiency, the Titan bureaucrat granted him\n> permission to leave the city grid. Dante made it clear, however, that\n> he didn't understand why a mere work supervisor would be interested in\n> nonproductive philosophical issues. It seemed to go beyond the\n> interests of most trustees. \"It will not benefit you.\"\n>\n> \"I'm sure you are right, Lord Dante . . . but it amuses me.\"\n>\n> Setting out before dawn, Iblis urged the smelly burrhorse into the\n> rocky desert and up the slopes to the monastery. Aquim awaited him at\n> the steep circular stairs to the tower, again looking disheveled and\n> somewhat dazed from semuta. From the first time Iblis had immersed his\n> hand in electrafluid and touched the Cogitor's thoughts, he could not\n> imagine why Aquim wanted to dull his perceptions. Perhaps the complex\n> enlightened thoughts of Eklo were so vast and overwhelming that the\n> big-shouldered secondary needed to dampen the flood of confusing\n> revelations.\n>\n> \"I see you look at me with disapproval,\" Aquim said, peering out\n> through slitted eyelids.\n>\n> \"Oh no,\" Iblis said. Then, realizing he could not get away with lying,\n> he said, \"I was just noticing that you enjoy your semuta.\"\n>\n> The big man smiled and spoke in a voice that slurred slightly. \"To an\n> outsider, it may appear that I have deadened my senses, but semuta\n> permits me to forget my own destructive past, before I was inspired to\n> join Cogitor Eklo. It also enables me to focus on what is really\n> important, ignoring the sensual distractions of the flesh.\"\n>\n> \"I can't picture you as a destructive man.\"\n>\n> \"Oh, but I was. My father fought against enslavement and died in the\n> attempt. Afterward, I sought revenge against the machines, and I was\n> good at it. I led a small band of men, and we . . . damaged some\n> robots. I am sorry to say that we also killed a number of trustee\n> slaves who got in our\n>\n> way, men such as yourself. Then Eklo arranged for my rescue, and for\n> my rehabilitation of sorts. He never told me why he sought me out, or\n> how he made the arrangements. There are many things the Cogitor does\n> not reveal to anyone, not even to me.\"\n>\n> Abruptly, the monk turned and plodded unsteadily up the stairs,\n> leading Iblis to the chamber where the Cogitor lived in a state of\n> eternal contemplation. Standing in the tower room with the\n> color-bathed observation windows, Aquim said, \"Eklo has considered\n> your situation at length. Long ago he watched the changes in humanity\n> after the Titans crushed the Old Empire, but he did nothing. Eklo\n> thought the challenge and adversity would improve the human race by\n> strengthening their minds, forcing them out of their sleepwalking\n> existence.\"\n>\n> The monk wiped a stain from the corner of his mouth. \"By separating\n> their minds from their bodies, the cymek Titans could have become\n> enlightened, like Cogitors. That was Eklo's hope when he assisted\n> Juno. But the Titans never rose above their animal flaws. This\n> weakness enabled Omnius to conquer them, and humanity.\" Aquim stepped\n> toward the translucent brain canister resting on a window shelf. \"Eklo\n> believes you may be able to institute a change.\"\n>\n> Iblis's heart leaped. \"Nothing is impossible.\" But he knew he could\n> not fight the machines by himself, would need to find others to help\n> him. *Many others.*\n>\n> Before the transparent window, Eklo's plexiplaz container glistened in\n> a wash of golden morning sunlight. In the distance, Iblis could see\n> the unending skyline of megaliths and monuments designed by the cymeks\n> and built with human sweat and blood. *Do I really want to see them\n> all crumble to dust?*\n>\n> The crew boss hesitated as he considered the consequences, remembering\n> the billions of victims of the Hrethgir Rebellions on Walgis and other\n> worlds. Then he sensed an intrusion into his thoughts, something\n> bumping against them.\n>\n> Aquim removed the covering of the Cogitor's canister, exposing the\n> nutrient fluid that supported the ancient mind. \"Come, Eklo wishes to\n> make direct contact with you.\"\n>\n> The tank's nutrient solution was like amniotic fluid, tingling with\n> immeasurable mental energy. Tentative, fighting his eagerness to know\n> and learn, Iblis dipped his fingers into the electrafluid, touching\n> the slippery surface of Eklo's brain and unlocking all the thoughts\n> the Cogitor wanted to give him.\n>\n> Aquim stood to one side with a strange expression on his face, part\n> beatific complacence, part envy.\n>\n> \"Neutrality is a delicate balancing act,\" Eklo said directly into\n> Iblis's mind, through the neurelectric contact promulgated by the\n> organic circuitry. \"Long ago, I answered Juno's many questions about\n> how to overthrow the Old Empire. My unbiased answers and advice\n> allowed the Titans to formulate successful plans, and the course of\n> the human race was forever changed. For many centuries I reconsidered\n> what I did.\" The brain seemed to press against Iblis's fingertips. \"It\n> is essential for all Cogitors to maintain absolute neutrality. We must\n> be objective.\"\n>\n> Puzzled, Iblis said, \"Then why are you speaking to me? Why have you\n> raised the possibility that the machines might be overthrown?\"\n>\n> \"In order to reestablish the balance of neutrality,\" Eklo said. \"Once,\n> I inadvertently assisted the Titans, so I must now answer your\n> questions with the same objectivity. In the final analysis, I will\n> have maintained equilibrium.\"\n>\n> Iblis swallowed hard. \"Then you have foreseen where it all ends?\"\n>\n> \"There are endings all around us, and beginnings. You alone can decide\n> where you are on the path.\"\n>\n> As Iblis's thoughts spun, searching for useful questions about machine\n> weaknesses and vulnerabilities, Eklo intruded, \"I cannot provide\n> concrete\n>\n> military or political details, but if you phrase your questions\n> cleverly enough, as Juno did, then you shall have what you need. The\n> art of cleverness is a prime lesson of life. You must outwit the\n> machines, Iblis Ginjo.\"\n>\n> For more than an hour, Eklo guided Iblis. \"I have considered this\n> problem for many centuries, long before you came to me. And if you do\n> not succeed, I shall consider it even longer.\"\n>\n> \"But I can't fail. I must succeed.\"\n>\n> \"It will take more than desire on your part. You must tap into the\n> deepest emotions of the masses.\" Eklo fell silent for several moments.\n>\n> Iblis struggled to comprehend, trying to stretch his thoughts. \"Love,\n> hate, fear? Is that what you mean?\"\n>\n> \"They are components, yes.\"\n>\n> \"Components?\"\n>\n> \"Of religion. The machines are very powerful, and it will take more\n> than a mere political or social uprising to defeat them. The people\n> must coalesce around a powerful idea that goes even deeper, into the\n> very essence of their existence, what it means to be human. You must\n> be more than a trustee, but a visionary leader. Slaves need to rise up\n> in a great holy war against the machines, an unstoppable jihad to\n> overthrow their masters.\"\n>\n> \"A holy war? A jihad? But how can I do that?\"\n>\n> \"I tell you only what I sense, Iblis Ginjo, what I have thought and\n> envisioned. You must go out and discover the rest of the answers for\n> yourself. But know this: Of all human wars in history, a jihad is the\n> most passionate, conquering worlds and civilizations, mowing down\n> everything in its path.\"\n>\n> \"And the people sending me messages--- how do they fit into this?\"\n>\n> \"I know nothing of them,\" Eklo said, \"and I do not see them in any of\n> my visions. Perhaps you have been specially chosen, or it might be\n> nothing but a ruse or a trap by the machines.\" The Cogitor fell\n> silent, then said, \"Now I must ask you to leave, for my mind is tired\n> and I need to rest.\"\n>\n> When Iblis departed from the imposing stone tower, he felt a strange\n> mixture of exhilaration and confusion. He needed to organize the\n> information into a comprehensive plan. Though he was not a holy man or\n> a military person, he did understand how to manipulate groups of\n> people, how to channel their loyalties in order to achieve his goals.\n> Already, his work crews would do almost anything for him. His\n> leadership abilities would be his greatest asset, and weapon. But the\n> scale was not large enough. It needed to be much larger than a few\n> hundred people in order to succeed.\n>\n> And he needed to be very careful, in case the thinking machines were\n> trying to trap him.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WITH ACCESS TO Omnius's watcheyes and distributed surveillance\n> hardware, Erasmus monitored the activities of his experimental\n> subjects. Many loyal trustees had ignored the hints he had sent to\n> them; others had been too frightened to act. But some had shown an\n> amusing amount of initiative.\n>\n> Yes, Erasmus felt that Iblis Ginjo was a perfect candidate to prove\n> his point, and win the bet with Omnius.\n>\n> *\"Systematic\" is a dangerous word, a dangerous concept. Systems\n> originate with their human creators. Systems take over.*\n\n--- TIO HOLTZMAN,\n\nacceptance speech for Poritrin Medal of Glory\n\n> **A**s he sat in the crowded room of equation solvers, Ishmael\n> scrutinized the furnishings of Savant Holtzman's estate, smelled\n> polishing oils, flower bouquets, perfumed candles. This place was\n> clean, comfortable, and warm . . . far more pleasant than the slave\n> barracks on the muddy river delta.\n>\n> The boy should have counted his blessings.\n>\n> But this unwelcome place was not Harmonthep. He missed his small boat,\n> navigating through rivulets in the tall reeds. He especially missed\n> the evenings, when the Zensunni would gather in the central hut on the\n> highest stilts to tell stories, recite fire poetry, or simply listen\n> to his grandfather read comforting sutras.\n>\n> \"I hate this place,\" Aliid said beside him, speaking loudly enough\n> that he drew a scolding glare from Tio Holtzman himself.\n>\n> \"Perhaps you would rather return to the mudflats or the agricultural\n> fields?\"\n>\n> Aliid frowned at his own outburst, but met the scientist's steady\n> gaze. \"I hated those places too,\" he mumbled, but not by way of\n> apology.\n>\n> All work stopped. All eyes were fixed on him.\n>\n> Holtzman shook his head in disbelief. \"I simply do not understand why\n> you people complain about everything. I feed and clothe you, I give\n> you easy assignments that advance the cause of humanity--- and still\n> you want to crawl back to squalid villages and live in disease and\n> filth.\"\n>\n> The inventor looked genuinely angry. \"Don't you understand that\n> thinking machines are out there trying to crush every living person?\n> Just imagine all the humans they slaughtered on Giedi Prime, and no\n> one could stop them! Omnius doesn't care about your religion or your\n> foolish politics against civilization. If they find your little\n> hovels, they will destroy them, burn them to the ground.\"\n>\n> *Just like the Tlulaxa slavers did to my village*, Ishmael thought. He\n> saw Aliid's dark eyes flash and knew that his friend was thinking the\n> same thing.\n>\n> Holtzman shook his head. \"You fanatics have no sense of\n> responsibility. Luckily, it is my job to force it on you.\" He went\n> back to his scribing board, angrily jabbed his fingers at the symbols.\n> \"Here are segments of equations. I need you to solve them. Simple\n> mathematics. *Try* to go through the steps I showed you.\" His gaze\n> narrowed. \"Each correct answer will earn one full share of daily\n> rations. If you make mistakes, you go hungry.\"\n>\n> With a heavy heart, Ishmael turned to the papers and computational\n> devices before him, doing his best to follow the supposedly simple\n> calculations.\n>\n> On Harmonthep, all the children in the marsh village had received a\n> basic education in mathematics, science, and engineering. The elders\n> felt that such knowledge would be important for them, when their\n> civilization rose again and the faithful constructed great cities like\n> those in Zensunni lore. Ishmael's grandfather, like many village\n> elders, also spent time instructing the young people in the sutras, in\n> logical and philosophical conundrums that only the tenets of Buddislam\n> could solve.\n>\n> On Aliid's home of IV Anbus, the closely orbiting moons changed the\n> seasons dramatically, causing the planet to oscillate. Thus, the boy\n> had been taught a different branch of mathematics and astronomy,\n> because the ever-varying calendar affected the floods that roared\n> through polished red rock gorges, where the Zenshiite cities had been\n> erected. Flood management workers required sophisticated calculations\n> to understand the variances. Aliid had learned the techniques in order\n> to help his own people. Here,\n>\n> though, he was forced to assist the overlords who had enslaved him,\n> and he resented it.\n>\n> Aliid's first assignment on Poritrin had been to work the cane\n> harvest. He had labored for weeks hacking at tall reeds, from which\n> sweet juices were turned into sugars or distilled into Poritrin rum.\n> The fibrous cane residue was used to make Poritrin cloth. He had\n> wielded a sharp scythe, chopping down woody stalks that splattered\n> sticky syrups. The stalks were harvested after heavy rains when they\n> were most laden with juices, and heaviest to carry.\n>\n> Toward the end of the cutting season, their master had delivered them\n> all to the slave markets in Starda, after accusing them of starting a\n> suspicious fire in the cane silos and destroying half a season's crop.\n> Aliid told Ishmael of this with a lilting smile, but never confessed\n> to having participated in any outright sabotage.\n>\n> Now, Ishmael bent over his calculations, checking and rechecking his\n> math by sliding bars and moving counters on the calculation device.\n> Already his stomach was growling, since Holtzman--- angry about the\n> many mistakes committed the previous day--- had vowed not to feed the\n> solvers until they proved they could do the work. Most of the slaves\n> grudgingly completed their assignments properly.\n>\n> Several days later, after the new solvers had adequately performed\n> their exercises, Holtzman gave them real work. At first, the inventor\n> let them believe it was merely another test. Ishmael could tell from\n> his expression and agitation, though, that he was counting on these\n> results rather than simply putting the crew through their paces.\n>\n> Aliid worked diligently, but Ishmael noted from his expression that he\n> had something devious in mind. Ishmael wasn't sure he wanted to know\n> what it was.\n>\n> After they had worked on numerical simulations for several more days,\n> Aliid finally leaned over to Ishmael. \"Now it is time to make a few\n> subtle changes,\" he said, grinning. \"Small enough that no one will\n> notice.\"\n>\n> \"We can't do that,\" Ishmael said. \"They'll catch us.\"\n>\n> The dark-haired boy gave an impatient frown. \"Holtzman has already\n> checked our work, so he's not going to redo all the math. Now that he\n> trusts us, he can focus on some other scheme. This is our only chance\n> to get even. Think of all we've suffered.\"\n>\n> Ishmael could not disagree, and after having heard Bel Moulay's talk\n> of bloody rebellion, this seemed like a better way to express their\n> displeasure.\n>\n> \"Look.\" Aliid pointed at the string of equations, and with his stylus\n> made a tiny mark, changing a minus sign to a plus sign, and then moved\n> a decimal point to a different part of the equation. \"Simple enough\n> mistakes, easily excused, but they will yield dramatically different\n> results.\"\n>\n> Ishmael was uneasy. \"I understand how it could harm Holtzman's\n> inventions, but I do not see how this will assist *us*. I'm more\n> concerned with seeing that we go back home.\"\n>\n> Aliid looked at him. \"Ishmael, you know the sutras as well as I,\n> perhaps better. Have you forgotten the one that says, 'When you help\n> your enemy, you harm all the faithful'?\"\n>\n> Ishmael had heard his grandfather utter the phrase, but never before\n> had it meant as much to him. \"All right. But nothing that can appear\n> deliberate.\"\n>\n> \"If I understand anything about this work,\" Aliid said, \"even a small\n> miscalculation will cause plenty of damage.\"\n>\n> *PSYCHOLOGY: The science of inventing words for things that do not\n> exist.*\n\n---ERASMUS,\n\n*Reflections on Sentient Biologicals*\n\n> **I**n the sunny botanical garden of the robot's grandiose villa,\n> Serena Butler snipped dead flowers and leaves, tending plants in their\n> beds and planters. Silently resistant, biding her time, Serena\n> performed her daily tasks like any other slave, but always Erasmus\n> watched her as if she were a pet. He was her captor and jailor.\n>\n> She wore black coveralls, her long, amber brown hair tied back in a\n> ponytail. The work allowed her to think of Xavier, of the promises\n> they had exchanged, of making love in the meadow after the bristleback\n> attack, and again in her plush bed on the night before she had slipped\n> off to Giedi Prime.\n>\n> Each morning Serena went to the robot's flower beds, glad for the\n> chance to think undisturbed about getting away from Earth. Day after\n> day, she kept her eyes open for some way to escape--- the obstacles\n> seemed insurmountable--- or a means to cause significant harm to the\n> thinking machines, despite the fact that sabotage would undoubtedly\n> cost her life, and her unborn baby's. Could she do that to Xavier?\n>\n> She couldn't imagine the grief he must be going through. Somehow she\n> would find a way back to him. She owed it to him, to herself, and to\n> their baby. She had hoped to have Xavier hold her hand as she\n> delivered their child. He should have been her husband by now, their\n> lives intertwined in a union stronger than the sum of their\n> individualities, a bastion to stand against the thinking machines.\n>\n> He didn't even know she was still alive.\n>\n> She stroked her curved belly. Serena felt the child growing within her\n> and was filled with foreboding. Two more months and the baby was\n> due--- what did Erasmus mean to do, once the child was born? She had\n> seen the locked doors to the ominous laboratories, had looked with\n> revulsion and horror at the filthy slave pens.\n>\n> And yet, the robot kept her busy with flowers.\n>\n> Erasmus often stood motionless beside her as she worked, his oval face\n> unreadable as he challenged her to debates. \"Understanding starts at\n> the beginning,\" he had said. \"I must build a foundation before I can\n> comprehend everything.\"\n>\n> \"But how will you use that knowledge?\" She yanked out a weed. \"Will\n> you think of more extravagant ways to inflict misery and pain?\"\n>\n> The robot paused, his burnished face a mirror that reflected a\n> distorted image of her own face. \"That is . . . not my objective.\"\n>\n> \"Then why do you keep so many slaves in such terrible conditions? If\n> you don't intend to cause misery, why not give them a clean place to\n> live? Why not provide them with better food, education, and care?\"\n>\n> \"It is not necessary.\"\n>\n> \"Maybe not to you,\" she said, surprised at her boldness. \"But they\n> would be happier and able to do better work.\"\n>\n> Serena had watched how Erasmus lived in magnificent luxury--- an\n> affectation, since no robot could require such things--- yet the\n> household slaves, especially those in the horrible communal pens,\n> existed in filth and fear. Whether or not she remained a captive here,\n> she might be able to improve their lot. If nothing else, she would\n> consider it a victory against the machines.\n>\n> She continued, \"It would take a truly . . . sophisticated thinking\n> machine to understand that improving the slaves' quality of life would\n> improve their\n>\n> productivity, and thus benefit their master as well. The slaves could\n> clean and maintain their own pens if they had the most minor\n> supplies.\"\n>\n> \"I will consider it. Provide me with a detailed list.\"\n>\n> Then, after giving him her suggestions, Serena had not seen the robot\n> for two days. Machine sentinels tended the workers in the villa, while\n> Erasmus himself vanished into his laboratories.\n>\n> She could hear nothing through the soundproofed barriers, though the\n> foul odors and disappearing people left her wondering. Finally,\n> another slave told her, \"You don't want to know what goes on in there.\n> Just be thankful you aren't required to clean up afterward.\"\n>\n> Now, Serena worked her hands in the loamy earth while listening to the\n> soothing classical music that Erasmus constantly played. Her back\n> ached and her joints swelled from the advancing pregnancy, but she did\n> not slacken her efforts.\n>\n> Erasmus approached so silently that she did not notice him until she\n> looked up from her plants to see his mirror-smooth face nested in a\n> frilly antique collar. She stood quickly to hide her startled reaction\n> and wiped her hands on her coveralls. \"Do you learn more by spying on\n> me?\"\n>\n> \"I can spy on you anytime I like. I learn a great deal from the\n> questions I ask.\" His shifting metallic-polymer film changed his face\n> into a frozen expression of dancing mirth. \"Now, I would like you to\n> select the flower you consider the most beautiful of all. I am curious\n> to see your response.\"\n>\n> Erasmus had played such games before. He seemed unable to understand\n> subjective decisions, wishing to quantify matters of opinion and\n> personal taste. \"Each plant is beautiful in its own way,\" she said.\n>\n> \"Nevertheless, choose one. Then explain your choice to me.\"\n>\n> She wandered down the dirt paths, looking from side to side. Erasmus\n> followed her, recording every time she hesitated at a blossom.\n>\n> \"There are observable characteristics, such as color, shape, and\n> delicacy,\" the robot said, \"and more esoteric variables such as the\n> perfume scent.\"\n>\n> \"Don't overlook the emotional component.\" Wistfulness tinged her\n> voice. \"Some of these plants remind me of my home on Salusa Secundus.\n> Certain flowers might have a greater sentimental value for me, though\n> not necessarily for anyone else. Maybe I remember a time when the man\n> I love gave me a bouquet. You wouldn't understand such associations,\n> however.\"\n>\n> \"You are stalling. Make your selection.\"\n>\n> She pointed to an immense elephant flower with bright streaks of\n> shimmering orange and red, highlighted by a horn-shaped stigma at the\n> center. \"Right now, this one is the most beautiful.\"\n>\n> \"Why?\"\n>\n> \"My mother used to grow these at our home. As a child, I never thought\n> them particularly pretty, but now they are a reminder of the happier\n> days--- before I met *you*.\" She immediately regretted her honesty,\n> because it revealed too much about her private thoughts.\n>\n> \"Very good, very good.\" The cognizant machine ignored her insult and\n> stared at the elephant flower, as if analyzing all aspects with his\n> full set of sensor capabilities. Like a wine connoisseur, he tried to\n> describe the merits of its scent, but to Serena his analysis sounded\n> clinical, lacking the subtleties and emotional layering that had\n> prompted her own selection.\n>\n> Strangest of all, Erasmus seemed aware of his own failing. \"I know\n> that humans are in some ways more sensitive than machines---*for now*.\n> However, machines have more potential to become superior in every\n> area. This is why I wish to understand all aspects of sentient\n> biological life.\"\n>\n> With an involuntary shudder, Serena thought of his sealed\n> laboratories, and knew from every indication that his secret\n> activities went far beyond the study of beautiful flowers.\n>\n> Erasmus assumed she was interested in his observations. \"If properly\n> developed, a thinking machine could be more perfect intellectually,\n> creatively, and spiritually than a human could ever hope to be, with\n> unparalleled mental freedom and range. I am inspired by the marvels we\n> could accomplish, if only Omnius did not exert such pressure on other\n> machines to conform.\"\n>\n> Serena listened, hoping he would let more information slip. Did she\n> sense a potential conflict between Erasmus and the computer evermind?\n>\n> The robot continued, \"Capacity for information is the key. Machines\n> will absorb not only more raw data, but more *feelings*, as soon as we\n> understand them. When that happens we will be able to love and hate\n> far more passionately than humans. Our music will be greater, our\n> paintings more magnificent. Once we achieve complete self-awareness,\n> thinking machines will create the greatest renaissance in history.\"\n>\n> Serena frowned at his assertions. \"You can keep improving yourself,\n> Erasmus, but we human beings use only small portions of our brains. We\n> have an enormous potential to develop new abilities. Your capacity for\n> learning is no greater than ours.\"\n>\n> The robot froze in place, as if startled. \"Quite right. How could I\n> have missed that important detail?\" His face shifted, becoming passive\n> and contemplative, then metamorphosed into a broad smile. \"The road to\n> improvement will be a long one. This will require more investigation.\"\n>\n> Abruptly he changed the subject, as if to emphasize her vulnerability.\n> \"What about your baby? Tell me the emotions you feel toward its father\n> and describe the physical act of copulation.\"\n>\n> Trying to stop the flood of painful recollections, Serena remained\n> silent. Erasmus found her reluctance fascinating. \"And are you\n> physically attracted to Vorian Atreides? I have run tests on the\n> handsome young man--- he is fine breeding stock. After your pregnancy\n> is finished, would you like to mate with him?\"\n>\n> Serena took an agitated breath, fixing her mind on memories of Xavier.\n> \"*Mate*? Regardless of how much you study us, there are many things\n> your machine brain will never understand about human nature.\"\n>\n> \"We shall see about that,\" he said, calmly.\n>\n> *Consciousness and logic are not reliable standards.*\n\n--- COGITORS,\n\n*Fundamental Postulate*\n\n> **A**linked cluster of robot drones scuttled over the *Dream\n> Voyager*'s hull as the craft sat in a drydock structure that spanned\n> an artificial crater on the spaceport grounds. Tiny machines crawled\n> into exhaust ports and scoured the reactor chambers, a coordinated\n> army of maintenance units repairing the damage inflicted by the League\n> Armada.\n>\n> Vor and Seurat stood on a platform looking at the drones, confident\n> that the repairs would be completed according to programmed\n> specifications. \"Soon, we will be able to depart,\" the robot captain\n> said. \"You must be anxious for me to defeat you again in our war\n> games.\"\n>\n> \"And you must be anxious to tell more jokes that I will not find\n> amusing,\" Vor countered.\n>\n> He did feel restless to be back aboard the *Dream Voyager*, but Vor\n> also had a different sort of impatience, an ache in his chest that\n> grew worse every time he thought of Erasmus's beautiful house slave.\n> Despite Serena Butler's complete dismissal of him, he could not stop\n> thinking about her.\n>\n> Worst of all, he did not understand why. Because of his paternal ties,\n> Vor Atreides had enjoyed numerous pleasure slaves, some as lovely as\n> this one. They had been bred and trained for their duties, and lived\n> in captivity among the thinking machines. But the female house slave\n> of Erasmus, despite having been brought to the robot's villa against\n> her will, gave no impression that she was defeated.\n>\n> Vor could see her face, the fullness of her lips, the penetrating gaze\n> of her lavender eyes as she looked at him with displeasure. Even\n> though her pregnancy showed, he was still drawn to her, and felt a\n> strange simmering jealousy. Where was her lover? Who was he?\n>\n> When Vor returned to Erasmus's villa, she would undoubtedly ignore or\n> insult him again. Nonetheless, he looked forward to seeing her before\n> he and Seurat departed on another long update run. He practiced what\n> he might say to her, but even in his imagination she could dance\n> circles around him with her wit.\n>\n> Vor climbed a ladder on the drydock framework and crawled into a\n> narrow interior wall space, where he watched a maintenance drone lay\n> down new webs of liquid circuitry for the main navigation panel. The\n> scarlet drone worked efficiently with its built-in tools. Vor inched\n> deeper into the confined area and peered at the open panel, noting the\n> dizzying pattern of colored components.\n>\n> \"You will be disappointed if you expect to catch it making a mistake,\"\n> Seurat said from behind him. \"Or are you attempting your frequently\n> threatened sabotage again?\"\n>\n> \"I am a dirty *hrethgir*. You can never tell what I might do, old\n> Metalmind.\"\n>\n> \"The fact that you do not laugh at my jokes indicates that you have\n> insufficient intelligence to institute such a devious plan, Vorian\n> Atreides.\"\n>\n> \"Maybe you're just not funny.\"\n>\n> Unfortunately, banter and repair activities did not distract Vor from\n> thoughts of Serena. He felt like a giddy boy, exhilarated and confused\n> at the same time. He wanted to talk to someone about his feelings, but\n> not his robot friend, who had even less understanding of women than\n> Vor did.\n>\n> Rather, he needed to talk with *Serena*. Perhaps with her insight and\n> intelligence, she had seen through him and didn't like what she saw.\n> She had called him \"a kept slave who cannot see his chains.\" A\n> baffling insult, considering all the privilege in his life. He had no\n> idea what she meant.\n>\n> The repair drone finished tracing the high-flux paths of an electronic\n> module, then switched tools to tune a data-collection port. The\n> machine's\n>\n> slender arm extruded farther out so it could interface with an\n> adjustment pad deep inside the panel.\n>\n> Standing inside the *Dream Voyager*'s cockpit, Seurat powered up the\n> ship's primary controls, using built-in diagnostics to verify the\n> navsystems. \"I have discovered an interesting shortcut to our second\n> stop on the update route. Unfortunately, it entails flying directly\n> through a blue-giant star.\"\n>\n> \"In that case, I'd advise a different route,\" Vor said.\n>\n> \"I concur, though I dislike wasting time.\"\n>\n> He wondered what would happen to Serena when the baby was born. Would\n> Erasmus assign it to the slave pens to keep it from interfering with\n> Serena's duties? For the first time in his life, Vor found himself\n> empathizing with a captive human.\n>\n> As a valued trustee, he had always considered himself part of the\n> Synchronized Worlds, and he looked forward to becoming a neo-cymek\n> someday. He believed that Omnius ruled humans for their own good;\n> otherwise, the galaxy would crumble into unguided chaos.\n>\n> He was accustomed to situations where one party was dominant and the\n> other submissive. For the first time he wondered if there could be\n> other types of relationships, on an equal, cooperative basis. The\n> robot captain of the *Dream Voyager* was clearly Vorian's master, but\n> they had a productive partnership.\n>\n> Vor wondered if he and Serena could go a step further and form a\n> relationship in which the two of them treated each other with complete\n> equality. It was a radical concept, one that jarred his sensibilities.\n> And yet, he didn't think she would accept anything less.\n>\n> Wedged into a narrow space behind the bulkhead and the navigation\n> panel, the maintenance drone made odd sounds, signaling to itself in\n> staticky gibberish, repeating test connections over and over.\n>\n> With a sigh, Vor said to the drone, \"Here, let me try that tool.\"\n>\n> The drone spun toward him and surrendered the diagnostic probe, but\n> part of its metal-film extensions crossed a connection in the exposed\n> circuit field, and a hot jolt of electricity struck like a hammer. It\n> squealed. The stench of melted circuits and fused hydraulics curled up\n> from the now-ruined system panel.\n>\n> Vorian scrambled out of the confined space, then wiped a hand across\n> his forehead. Seurat scanned the damaged drone and the blackened\n> components of the ship's navsystem. \"It is my expert assessment that\n> we need to perform a bit more maintenance here.\"\n>\n> When Vor laughed at the comment, Seurat was surprised. \"Why do you\n> find that funny?\"\n>\n> \"Never ask someone to explain humor, Seurat. Just accept the\n> laughter.\"\n>\n> After shutting down the power supply, Vor removed the blistered,\n> malfunctioning drone and dropped it with a clatter onto the deck.\n> These units were expendable. Seurat transmitted a request for a new\n> drone.\n>\n> While they waited for the repairs to continue, Vor shored up his\n> resolve.\n>\n> Collecting his questions, he mentioned the quandary of his feelings.\n>\n> Perhaps something in the robot's database would be useful.\n>\n> Embedded in his smooth face, the robot's optic threads twinkled like\n> tiny suns. \"I do not understand your problem,\" Seurat said while he\n> uploaded a diagnostic summary from one of the ship's databanks. \"You\n> have appropriate standing among the thinking machines. Submit a\n> request to Erasmus.\"\n>\n> Vor was exasperated. \"It's not like that, Seurat. Even if Erasmus\n> transfers Serena to me . . . what if she refuses me?\"\n>\n> \"Then widen your search. You make this unnecessarily difficult. Among\n> the human candidates on Earth, you will easily find a compatible\n> female, even\n>\n> one with features similar to this particular slave, if you value her\n> physical attributes so much.\"\n>\n> Vor wished he had never brought up the subject. \"Thinking machines can\n> be utterly stupid at times.\"\n>\n> \"You have never expressed such emotions to me before.\" \"That's because\n> I never felt this way before.\"\n>\n> Seurat froze in place. \"I am intellectually aware of the human\n> biological imperative to mate and reproduce. I am familiar with the\n> physical differences between men and women, and of the hormonal urges\n> you have. Given acceptable genetics, most female reproductive systems\n> are essentially the same. Why should this Serena be more desirable\n> than any other?\"\n>\n> \"I could never explain it to you, old Metalmind,\" Vor said, as he\n> looked through a porthole and watched another drone marching across\n> the drydock platform toward the ship. \"I can't even explain it to\n> myself.\"\n>\n> \"I hope you figure it out soon. I cannot afford to keep replacing\n> maintenance drones.\"\n>\n> *Often people die because they are too cowardly to live.*\n\n--- TLALOC,\n\n*A Time for Titans*\n\n> **T**he blistering sun of Arrakis shone overhead, creating few shadows\n> around the monster and its confident rider.

Objectively speaking, even if\n> the arithmetic had been done correctly, his original design would have\n> remained unworkable . . . but that was beside the point, he decided.\n>\n> The solvers had committed inexcusable errors, regardless of their\n> relevance to the overall question. It was certainly enough to shift\n> the blame from him.\n>\n> Holtzman marched into the hushed room where human calculators sat at\n> tables, churning through equation iterations that Norma had given\n> them. He halted inside the doorway and surveyed them as they worked at\n> their calculation devices and made entries on pads.\n>\n> \"You will cease activity now! Henceforth, all of your work will be\n> closely monitored and verified, no matter how long it takes. I will go\n> through each paper, study every solution you derive.

Haven't I given you a better life than you would have had in\n> the cane fields or on the riverbanks? And this is how you repay me?\"\n>\n> The new solvers looked at him, terror on their young faces. The older\n> workers, the ones who had not died from the fever, sagged with gloom.\n>\n> \"How many other errors have you made? How many other tests are likely\n> to be ruined by your incompetence?\" He glared at the slaves, then\n> grabbed a paper at random. \"Henceforth, if I find any *intentional*\n> mistakes, you will be executed--- mark my words! Since we are working\n> on a war program, that would be sabotage and sedition.\"\n>\n> Norma hurried into the room, taking uneven strides on her short legs.\n> \"What is this, Savant Holtzman?\"\n>\n> He held up a sheet marked with his own scribblings. \"I have found\n> serious mistakes in my alloy-resonance calculations.

She bowed slightly. \"As you\nwish.\"\n\n> \"In the meantime,\" Holtzman said, gathering up papers, \"I am cutting\n> your rations in half. Why should I keep your bellies full while you\n> undermine our efforts to defeat the enemy?\" The slaves groaned.\n> Holtzman summoned his Dragoon guards to usher them away. \"I will not\n> abide such sloppiness. Too much is at stake.\"\n>\n> When they were alone in the room, he and Norma sat down and began to\n> study the new calculations, one sheet at a time.

The primary robotic vessels carried the cymek general and\n> his two Titan companions, as well as dozens of ambitious neo-cymeks.\n> The watcheyes of Omnius monitored their movements.\n>\n> Behind the cymeks, a fleet of robot warships accelerated and veered\n> around them to arrive first, sleek projectiles with enormous engines\n> and heavily loaded with artillery. The machine warships were one-way\n> units, never meant to go home; their engines burned hot, saving no\n> fuel for a return journey. They came in so fast that by the time the\n> orbiting Rossak sentry stations detected them, the thinking machines\n> had arrived and opened fire. The picket ships and the sentries at the\n> system's perimeter never had a chance to launch a shot.\n>\n> While the robot ships engaged the orbital stations, the cymeks planned\n> to take their personal revenge on the surface.\n>\n> As the strike force cruised closer to Rossak, the cymeks prepared\n> their armored warrior-forms. Servo-handlers installed individual brain\n> canisters into protected sockets, linking thoughtrodes with control\n> systems, priming weapons. The three Titans would use powerful\n> glider-forms, armed flying bodies. In contrast, the neo-cymeks wore\n> destructive combat bodies, crablike walkers that could march\n> unhindered through jungle obstacles.\n>\n> Agamemnon and his cymeks accelerated into the ionized wake of the\n> robot vessels that had already flashed past. Installed in his flying\n> body, the general tested his integral weapons. He was anxious to feel\n> rock, metal, and flesh in the grip of his extruded cutting claws.\n>\n> He studied tactical diagrams and watched the first robotic salvos hit\n> the defensive stations above Rossak. This League outpost was a minor\n> planet with a relatively small population clustered in jungle-choked\n> rift valleys, while the rest of the surface and oceans remained\n> inhospitable. Rossak had not yet installed the expensive Holtzman\n> scrambler shield defenses that protected major human worlds such as\n> Salusa Secundus and Giedi Prime.\n>\n> But the deadly Sorceresses with their freakish mental powers had\n> sparked the ire of the cymeks. Ignoring the space battle, Agamemnon's\n> ships plunged toward the smoky atmosphere. In the sheltered cave\n> cities they would find the Sorceresses, their families and friends.\n> Victims, all of them.\n>\n> Mentally, he opened a link to his cymek fighting force. \"Xerxes, lead\n> the vanguard as you did on Salusa Secundus. I want your ship at the\n> point.\"\n>\n> In his broadband transmitted response, Xerxes could not conceal his\n> fear. \"We should be cautious against these telepathic women,\n> Agamemnon.

He had been the last to undergo cymek surgery, not\n> wanting to give up his precious sensations.\n>\n> But after more than a century of rule, the misguided Xerxes grew\n> complacent. Foolishly, he delegated too many duties to the\n> artificially intelligent machines programmed by Barbarossa. He even\n> let the computer network make decisions for him. During the uproar of\n> the Hrethgir Rebellions on Corrin, Richese, and Walgis, Xerxes had\n> relied on the thinking machines to maintain order on his own planets.\n> With his lack of attention to detail and his sanguine trust of the AI\n> network, he had given the machines free rein to keep the unrest from\n> spreading. Fatuous Xerxes blithely surrendered control to the computer\n> grid, ordering it to take care of whatever troubles might arise.\n>\n> Using this unprecedented access to core information, the sentient\n> computer cut off Xerxes and immediately took over the planet. To\n> overthrow the Old Empire, Barbarossa had programmed the thinking\n> machines with the potential to be aggressive, so that they had an\n> incentive to conquer. With its new power, the fledgling AI entity---\n> after dubbing itself \"Omnius\"--- conquered the Titans themselves,\n> taking charge of cymeks and humans alike, purportedly for their own\n> good.\n>\n> Agamemnon had cursed himself for not watching Xerxes more closely, and\n> for not executing him out-of-hand when his negligent ways first became\n> apparent.\n>\n> The computer takeover had spread like a nuclear reaction, faster than\n> the Titans could send warnings to each other, before they could shut\n> down the AI grids. In a flash, the Titan-dominated planets became\n> Synchronized Worlds.

I leave the\n> unskilled ones in your hands.\"\n>\n> *Unskilled ones?* Now was not the time to argue with her. Venport\n> searched for some sign of fear in her eyes. He spoke softly in\n> response, an attempt to mask his feelings. \"Are you going to sacrifice\n> yourself?\"\n>\n> \"I cannot.\" Zufa showed pain at the admission. \"Who would train the\n> Sorceresses if I did?\" He did not entirely believe her.\n>\n> She hesitated, as if expecting something more from him, then hurried\n> down the corridor. \"Stay safe,\" Venport called after her.\n>\n> After she had gone, he raced through the corridors, calling out to\n> families. \"We must take shelter in the jungles! Spread out.\" He raised\n> his voice, issuing orders confidently. \"The cymeks are coming!\"\n>\n> Venport told half a dozen young men to run from room to room in the\n> cave city, checking to make certain the message reached everyone. As\n> the youths hurried to complete their tasks, he did his own searching\n> in isolated chambers. Men, women, a hodgepodge of body shapes.

They understood the byways of the dense and dangerous\n> wilderness, knew where the shelters were in the metallic-purple\n> jungle.\n>\n> Signals from Armada ships indicated that the battle around the orbital\n> platforms was going badly.

Venport hurried more\n> stragglers toward a cliff overhang for departure. Suddenly, red-hot\n> projectiles stabbed through the atmosphere, their hulls trailing oily\n> black smoke.\n>\n> \"Faster!\" Venport shouted, and then ran into the tunnels to look for\n> the last stragglers, knowing that he too had only a few moments to get\n> himself to safety.\n>\n> *We have our lives, but we also have priorities. Too many people fail\n> to recognize the difference.*\n>\n> --- ZUFA CENVA,\n\nlecture to Sorceresses\n\n> **T**he cymek landers crashed into the silvery-purple wilderness,\n> scattering animals, blackening fungal vegetation. Fireguns spat gouts\n> of lava from the hulls, setting fire to dense foliage. The\n> conflagration spread quickly.\n>\n> With a groan and crash that echoed through the cloudy air, the cymek\n> vessels split open and the mechanical warrior bodies emerged. Three\n> landers disgorged armed glider-forms, while the rest yielded crablike\n> combat walker-forms that bristled with weapons.\n>\n> In his angular glide-body, Xerxes cruised above the jungles toward the\n> enclave of telepathic Sorceresses. Silently airborne, he extended his\n> wings and began steering on the up-drafts of wind. \"I'm heading in.\"\n>\n> \"Kill the bitches for us, Xerxes,\" said Juno, as she and Agamemnon\n> prepared their own glide-bodies.\n>\n> In an angry voice, Agamemnon added, \"Kill them for *Barbarossa*.\"\n>\n> Xerxes soared toward the pockmarked cliffs. Below, the nimbly\n> advancing combat machines of the eager neo-cymeks plowed through\n> underbrush, blasting obstacles, destroying everything in sight.\n>\n> In full view of the cliff warrens, Xerxes briefly hovered above the\n> polymerized canopy that formed a small landing area for *hrethgir*\n> ships, then launched fifteen projectiles. Half of them struck the hard\n> cliff walls, detonating in white-and-black starbursts of broken rock;\n> other shots penetrated the tunnels where humans lived like grubs\n> infesting wood.\n>\n> In rapid retreat, Xerxes raced back across the treetops and lifted\n> into the sky. As Agamemnon and Juno soared toward him, he crowed in\n> triumph, \"Our first score! Let the neo-cymeks continue the rout.\"\n>\n> Smooth fiber-wound systems and extruded legs carried the neo-cymek\n> footsoldiers through the underbrush. From front launcher tubes they\n> shot plasma grenades that incinerated a pathway to the tunnel cities.\n> Soft purple foliage ignited around them, fungal trees bursting into\n> columns of flame and sending indigenous animals fleeing. Majestic\n> birds soared into the sky, and the cymek attackers blasted them into\n> clouds of crackling feathers.\n>\n> Though pleased that the initial salvo had gone smoothly, Agamemnon did\n> not offer any congratulations. He and Juno swept silently forward for\n> the second airborne attack from different positions. Below them, the\n> crablike neo-cymek walkers arrived at the cliffs to complete the\n> destruction.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> ZUFA CENVA AND her Sorceress commandos prepared themselves inside an\n> internal room that Aurelius Venport had designed for his business\n> meetings. None of them showed fear, only anger and determination. For\n> the past year, these women had accepted their primary purpose in life,\n> even if its completion would result in their deaths.\n>\n> \"This is what we've trained for,\" Zufa said. \"But I won't delude you\n> about our chances.\" Uncertain of her words, she nonetheless tried to\n> sound confident.\n>\n> \"We are ready, Mistress Cenva,\" the women said in unison.\n>\n> She drew a deep breath, calming herself, using the mental control she\n> had worked so hard to instill in her students.\n>\n> The chamber's stone walls trembled as the first bombs found their\n> targets, dispersing poison clouds into the tunnels. Thinking ahead,\n> Aurelius Venport had made certain every woman had a breathing mask\n> while he evacuated the rest of the population. Zufa was surprised she\n> hadn't thought of the\n>\n> precaution herself. She hoped he had managed to get to safety, that he\n> hadn't foolishly wasted time trying to protect his stockpiles of\n> drugs.\n>\n> Now she looked at the devoted women with her, knowing their names and\n> their personalities: Tirbes, who might become the best if she could\n> harness her potential; impulsive Silin; creative and unpredictable\n> Camio; Rucia, who followed her code of honor . . . and more.\n>\n> \"Camio,\" she said, \"I choose you to strike our next blow.\"\n>\n> A thin young woman with long straw-white hair stood, her expression\n> settling into a bloodless smile. \"It is my honor, Mistress Cenva.\"\n>\n> Leaving her sisters behind, Camio adjusted the breathing mask over her\n> face, then emerged from the sheltered chamber. She moved forward\n> steadily and began the meditation necessary to summon the power locked\n> within her brain. Surprisingly, she saw no bodies in the stone\n> corridors, which reassured her that the population had been\n> successfully evacuated. Now nothing would hinder the Sorceresses.\n>\n> Rubble lay strewn on the tunnel floor, dislodged by explosive blasts.\n> Wisps of greenish vapor carried poison into the caves. Camio was not\n> afraid for her own life, but she had to hurry.\n>\n> She heard the whistle of an approaching projectile and pressed herself\n> against the tunnel wall. A powerful blast struck the cliffside,\n> sending a shockwave through the interior corridors and dwelling rooms.\n> Camio regained her balance, then pushed onward. The inside of her\n> skull sang with pent-up energies. She did not glance at the tapestries\n> and furniture, at the rooms and meeting chambers where she had spent\n> her life.\n>\n> Rossak was her home. The machines were her enemies. Camio herself was\n> a weapon.\n>\n> When she made her way to the opening and looked out upon the burning\n> jungle, she saw three crablike walker-forms with heavily armored brain\n>\n> canisters hanging like egg sacks just above the legs. Each was a human\n> who had sold his soul and sworn loyalty to the thinking machines.\n>\n> Out in the jungle Camio heard the thunder of continued explosions, a\n> roar of plasma blasts incinerating purplish foliage. Glider-forms\n> soared in for a new attack, dumping poison, spraying flames. Dozens of\n> neo-cymek walkers strode toward the protected cliffs, destroying\n> everything around them.\n>\n> She must wait until the right moment in order to eradicate as many\n> enemies as possible, all at once.\n>\n> From below, Camio heard a smooth skittering. The three fastest\n> walker-forms were scaling the sheer cliff, using explosive-driven\n> anchors and diamond-edged claws to grasp the rock face.\n>\n> She smiled at the trio of crablike neo-cymeks. Flexible armored legs\n> hauled the weapon-studded body cores up to the main caves. Camio stood\n> alone in the doorway, facing her cyborg enemies. She knew when they\n> were close enough.\n>\n> The first neo-cymek invader raised itself, and she saw the sparkling\n> optic threads around its weapon turrets. Detecting her, the cymek\n> turned its flamers toward the new target. Fibrous scope-cameras shone\n> brightly.\n>\n> In the instant before it could fire, Camio released the pent-up\n> energies within her mind and body. She let go with a mindstorm that\n> boiled the brains of the three closest neo-cymeks, and damaged two\n> others just beginning to climb the cliff. Five cymeks, removed from\n> the battle.\n>\n> Her last thought was of the excellent bargain she had made for her\n> life.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> AFTER CAMIO, FOUR more Sorceresses emerged, one at a time. As she\n> dispatched each woman, Zufa Cenva felt the acute loss. These trainees\n> were like true daughters, and losing them felt like swallowing gulps\n> of acid. But\n>\n> her volunteers willingly marched out and sacrificed their lives to\n> crush the cymek offensive. \"The thinking machines must never win.\"\n>\n> Finally Zufa's sixth volunteer, Silin, returned alive but disoriented,\n> her milky-pale skin flushed. She had mentally prepared herself to die.\n> Instead, she had found nothing left to destroy.\n>\n> \"They have retreated beyond range, Mistress Cenva,\" she reported. \"The\n> cymeks are pulling back to their ships. The combat walkers and gliders\n> have returned to the landing area.\"\n>\n> Zufa hurried through the wreckage to the window overhangs. She saw the\n> charred remains of her five fallen commandos, each woman burned from\n> the inside out with white-hot mental fire. Her heart felt the volcanic\n> heat of anger and loss. She watched the terrible machines with human\n> minds climb aboard their vessels and punch back into the atmosphere.\n>\n> In time, the scattered refugees would return. Aurelius Venport would\n> bring them back. Under his supervision, the Rossak people would\n> rebuild and repair the cliff cities with pride and confidence, knowing\n> that they had stood up against the thinking machines.\n>\n> Zufa Cenva had to cling to that. \"We define victories in our own way,\"\n> she said aloud.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> WHEN THE THREE Titans joined their ships with the robotic battle\n> fleet, Agamemnon issued his summary before Juno or the fool Xerxes\n> could give the thinking machines information he didn't want them to\n> have. The cymek general would color the truth to suit his purposes.\n>\n> \"We have made a significant impact,\" Agamemnon declared to the\n> recording watcheyes. \"Though we lost several neo-cymeks in our direct\n> assault on Rossak, we did inflict mortal cellular damage on at least\n> five of the powerful Sorceresses.\"\n>\n> Over a tight private channel, Juno transmitted her surprise and\n> delight at the Titan general's skewing of his report. Xerxes wisely\n> knew to remain silent.\n>\n> \"We have caused substantial harm to the new *hrethgir* telepathic\n> weapon,\" Agamemnon continued, sounding proud in the face of the\n> disaster. \"It should be a drastic setback to their capabilities.\"\n>\n> He had similarly colored past events while writing his memoirs,\n> painting his own biased version of history. Omnius would never\n> question the summary, because it fit technically with the objective\n> facts.\n>\n> \"Best of all,\" Juno added, \"we lost none of the Titans in this\n> offensive. The neo-cymeks can all be replaced.\"\n>\n> With Rossak's two orbital stations severely damaged by the robot\n> warships, and thousands of humans dead on board, the thinking machine\n> fleet withdrew from the wreckage of ships and platforms. Below, the\n> jungles in the habitable canyons continued to burn.\n>\n> \"In my assessment, Omnius can record the strike on Rossak an\n> unqualified victory!\" Agamemnon said.\n>\n> \"Agreed,\" Juno and Xerxes both chimed in.\n>\n> *It seems as if some perverse sorcerer set out to foul up a planet as\n> much as possible . . . and then seeded it with melange for a prize.*\n\n---TUK KEEDAIR,\n\ncorrespondence with Aurelius Venport\n\n> **H**ard-eyed scavengers positioned themselves in strategic places\n> along the hot, dusty streets of Arrakis City. They peered through\n> narrow slits in the dirty cloths over their faces and held out their\n> hands or jangled small bells, begging for water. Tuk Keedair had never\n> seen anything like it.\n>\n> He'd been forced to remain here for a full month while Naib Dhartha's\n> nomads gathered enough melange to fill the Tlulaxa cargo ship. Keedair\n> had paid for lodging in Arrakis City, but after a week he decided that\n> his private shuttle at the spaceport offered better sleeping\n> facilities. He enjoyed being away from the inquisitive eyes of other\n> guests, fights in the halls, solicitors, and beggars. When alone, a\n> man never had to worry about trusting his companions.\n>\n> Arrakis posed so many problems to establishing a simple business. He\n> felt like a swimmer struggling against a powerful tide . . . not that\n> any native of this desert would understand the comparison. Up in the\n> orbiting cargo ship Keedair's would-be slave raiders were restless, so\n> he'd had to shuttle up and resolve disputes to avert violence. A\n> Tlulaxa knew how to cut losses. Twice now, disgusted with unruly\n> crewmen too bored to behave themselves, he'd sold their work contracts\n> to geological survey teams in the deep desert. If, by some chance, the\n> rowdies returned to Arrakis City before his cargo vessel departed with\n> its load of spice, those humbled men would crawl on their knees and\n> beg him to take them back to the Thalim system.\n>\n> Another problem. Although Naib Dhartha was ostensibly Keedair's\n> business partner in this enterprise, the Zensunni leader did not trust\n> others. To increase speed and efficiency, Keedair had offered to fly\n> his shuttle directly out to where the nomads harvested the spice, but\n> the naib would hear none of it. Keedair then offered to ferry Dhartha\n> and his Zensunni band\n>\n> out to their settlement, thus eliminating the long trek from a\n> mountain hideaway. But that idea had been refused as well.\n>\n> So Keedair had to wait at the spaceport, week after week, while groups\n> of dusky-skinned desert rats trudged into town, their backs bowed from\n> heavy packs filled with spice. He paid them in installments and\n> dickered if he found inordinate amounts of sand mixed into the\n> melange, making it artificially heavy. The naib protested his\n> innocence, but Keedair detected a certain amount of grudging respect\n> for an offworlder who would not be taken for a fool. Keedair's cargo\n> hold was filling so slowly that he thought he would go mad.\n>\n> Through all the difficulties, Keedair soothed his troubled nerves by\n> sampling more and more of the product. He became fond of spice beer,\n> spice coffee, and just about anything else that contained the\n> remarkable ingredient.\n>\n> In his most lucid moments, Keedair questioned his decision to remain\n> here, wondering if it might have been wiser to take a loss on this\n> whole raid and simply go back to the civilized League Worlds. There he\n> could start over, take possession of another cargo load of squalling\n> slaves to be sold on Poritrin or Zanbar, or bring fresh organ\n> resources back to the Tlulaxa farms.\n>\n> As he sat in his private cabin, Keedair stroked his long braid and\n> swore not to give up on his gamble. Returning now would force him to\n> accept massive losses for the year, and he would be honor-bound to\n> shear off his lovely hair. Stubborn pride compelled him to remain on\n> Arrakis as long as possible.\n>\n> He disliked the arid environment, the smell of burnt rocks in the air,\n> and the howling storms that battered the mountains and scoured the\n> spaceport. But oh how he loved melange! Day after day, Keedair sat\n> alone in his shuttlecraft and consumed hefty quantities, even adding\n> spice to his packaged food supplies, which made the blandest meals\n> taste like ambrosia.\n>\n> In a drug-fog, he envisioned selling the product to rich nobles,\n> offworld hedonists on Salusa Secundus, Kirana III, and Pincknon---\n> perhaps even to\n>\n> the fanatical bioresearchers on Tlulax. He had felt vibrant and alive\n> since adding melange to his diet, and every day it seemed that his\n> face looked more relaxed and younger. He stared into an illuminated\n> mirror, studying his narrow features. The whites of his eyes had begun\n> to show an unnatural indigo tinge, like diluted ink seeping into the\n> sclera.\n>\n> Naib Dhartha's tribe of desert people had those eerie \"blue-blue\"\n> eyes. An environmental contaminant? Maybe a manifestation of heavy\n> melange consumption? He felt too marvelous to consider that it might\n> be a debilitating side effect. Probably just a temporary\n> discoloration.\n>\n> He prepared a fresh cup of potent spice coffee.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> THE FOLLOWING DAWN, as the star-pricked sky faded into pastel sunrise,\n> a group of wandering nomads came to the spaceport, led by Naib\n> Dhartha. They toted bulging packs of spice on their shoulders.\n>\n> Keedair hurried to meet them, blinking into the bright morning light.\n> Wrapped in dusty white traveling clothes, Dhartha looked pleased with\n> himself. \"This is the last of the melange you requested, Trader\n> Keedair.\"\n>\n> As a matter of form, he went forward to inspect four packs at random,\n> verifying that they indeed contained rich melange fresh from the\n> desert scraping grounds, with sand filtered out of it.\n>\n> \"As before, your product is acceptable. This is all I need to complete\n> my cargo. Now I shall return to civilization.\"\n>\n> But Keedair did not like the expression on Dhartha's face. He wondered\n> if it might become profitable for his own men to raid some cave\n> settlements out in the deserts after all, enslaving a few of these\n> sand rats.\n>\n> \"You will return to us, Trader Keedair?\" A greedy glint illuminated\n> the darkness behind the indigo of his eyes. \"If you request more\n> melange, I will be happy to provide it for you. We could come to an\n> extended agreement.\"\n>\n> Keedair grunted noncommittally, unwilling to give the man too much\n> hope for a future business relationship. \"Depends on whether I can\n> sell this load for a profit. Spice is an unproven commodity in the\n> League, and I'm taking a big enough risk as it is.\" He drew himself\n> up. \"But we've agreed on a deal for this load, and I am always true to\n> my word.\"\n>\n> He paid Dhartha the remaining amount. \"If I return, it will be many\n> months from now, perhaps a year. If I lose money, I won't come back at\n> all.\" Dismissively, he scanned the grimy spaceport, the desert, and\n> the craggy mountains. \"Not that there is anything else to bring me\n> back to Arrakis.\"\n>\n> Dhartha looked him squarely in the eye. \"No one can know the future,\n> Trader Keedair.\" Their deal consummated, the desert leader bowed and\n> stepped back. The white-clad nomads watched Keedair like vultures\n> eyeing a dying animal, waiting to pick apart the corpse.\n>\n> He returned to his shuttle without a further farewell, anticipating\n> that he might just turn a profit on this venture. Keedair tried to\n> envision how to make spice into a viable long-term business, with less\n> aggravation than procuring and handling troublesome slaves.\n>\n> Unfortunately, the operations he had in mind would require a large\n> infusion of capital, and he didn't have that kind of money. But he had\n> a worthy outside investor in mind. Exactly the person he needed, a\n> connoisseur of exotic drugs, a man of great wealth and vision . . . an\n> entrepreneur who could intelligently judge the potential of such an\n> operation.\n>\n> Aurelius Venport of Rossak.\n>\n> *\"I am not evil,\" said Shaitan. \"Do not try to label what you do not\n> understand.\"*\n>\n> ---*Buddislamic Sutra*\n>\n> **W**hile Serena tended the robot's prized flowers in their delicate\n> terra cotta pots, Erasmus watched her with continuing fascination.\n>\n> She looked up, not sure how far she could--- or should--- push the\n> thinking machine. \"In order to understand humanity, Erasmus, it is not\n> necessary to inflict so much cruelty.\"\n>\n> The robot swiveled his mirrored face to her, forming the flowmetal\n> into a puzzled expression. \"Cruelty? I have never had such an intent.\"\n>\n> \"You are evil, Erasmus. I see the way you treat human slaves, how you\n> torment them, torture them, force them to live under terrible\n> conditions.\"\n>\n> \"I am not evil, Serena, just curious. I pride myself on the\n> objectivity of my researches.\"\n>\n> She stood behind a flowerpot holding a bright red spray of geraniums,\n> as if it might protect her in case the robot became violent. \"Oh?

It smashed on the\n> hard glazed tiles of the greenhouse floor.\n>\n> Erasmus looked at the shattered clay pot, the spilled earth, the\n> crumpled red flowers. \"Unlike humans, I never destroy\n> indiscriminately, to no purpose.\"\n>\n> Serena lifted her chin. \"You never show a kind side, either. Why not\n> do good deeds for a change?\"\n>\n> \"Good deeds?\" Erasmus seemed genuinely interested. \"Such as?\"\n>\n> Automated misters sprayed down from the greenhouse piping, watering\n> the plants with a gentle hiss. Not wanting to lose the opportunity,\n> Serena said, \"Feed your slaves better, for one thing.

Isn't it wonderful? You should be overjoyed.\"\n>\n> \"I am . . . intrigued,\" she said.\n>\n> Erasmus raised his metal hands, and sentinel robots opened the\n> barricades and urged the chosen humans forward. The slaves hurried to\n> the tables, but they seemed intimidated.\n>\n> \"I have selected the demographics carefully,\" Erasmus said, \"including\n> representatives from all different castes: trustee humans, simple\n> workers, artisans, and even the most ill-mannered slaves.\"\n>\n> The captives took their seats and sat rigidly, staring at the food,\n> their hands fumbling on their laps. They all carried a look of\n> skittish fear mixed with confusion. Many of the guests looked as if\n> they would rather be anywhere but here, for no one trusted the master\n> of the house. The food was probably poisoned, and all the guests would\n> die horribly while Erasmus took notes.\n>\n> \"Eat!\" the robot said. \"I have prepared this feast. It is my good\n> deed.\"\n>\n> Now Serena understood what he was doing. \"This isn't what I meant,\n> Erasmus. I intended for you to give them better rations, to improve\n> their daily nutrition, to make them healthier. A single banquet does\n> nothing.\"\n>\n> \"It increases their goodwill toward me.\" Some guests tentatively put\n> food on their plates, but no one had yet dared to take a bite. \"Why\n> are they not eating? I have made a generous effort.\" The robot looked\n> at Serena for an answer.\n>\n> \"They are terrified of you, Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \"But I am not being evil now.\"\n>\n> \"How do they know that? How can they trust you? Tell me the truth, did\n> you poison the food? Maybe just random dishes?\"\n>\n> \"An interesting idea, but that is not part of the experiment.\" Erasmus\n> remained perplexed. \"However, an observer often affects the outcome of\n> his experiment. I see no way around this problem.\" Then his pliable\n> face formed a large grin. \"Unless I become part of the experiment\n> myself.\"\n>\n> Extruding his snakelike sensory probe, Erasmus strutted around the\n> nearest table, dipping the analytical tip into different sauces and\n> dishes, studying each bit of spice or flavor chemically. The people\n> watched him uncertainly.\n>\n> Serena saw many faces turn toward her, hopeful. Arriving at a\n> decision, she smiled reassuringly and raised her voice. \"Listen to me.\n> Eat, and enjoy his feast. Erasmus has no evil purpose in mind today.\"\n> She looked at the robot. \"Unless he has lied to me.\"\n>\n> \"I do not know how to lie.\"\n>\n> \"I'm certain you could learn, if you studied enough.\"\n>\n> Serena marched to the nearest banquet table, where she picked up a\n> morsel of tender meat from the nearest platter and popped it into her\n> mouth. Then she went down the table, plucked a slice of fruit, tasted\n> a dessert.\n>\n> The people smiled, their eyes shining. The young woman seemed angelic\n> and reassuring as she sampled dishes, doing her best to prove that the\n> banquet was indeed what it appeared to be. \"Come, my friends, and join\n> me. Though I cannot give you your freedom, we shall at least share one\n> afternoon of happiness.\"\n>\n> Like starving men, the captives fell to the platters of food, taking\n> large helpings, groaning with pleasure, spilling sauces, and then\n> licking everything up so as not to waste a speck. They looked at her\n> with gratitude and admiration, and Serena felt warm inside, glad that\n> she had at last accomplished something for these poor people.\n>\n> For the first time, Erasmus had tried to do a good deed. Serena hoped\n> to coerce him into doing more.\n>\n> One woman came over and tugged at Serena's sleeve. Serena looked at\n> the large dark eyes, the haggard but hopeful expression. \"What is your\n> name?\" the slave asked. \"We need to know. We will tell others what you\n> have done here.\"\n>\n> \"I am Serena,\" she said. \"Serena Butler. And I have asked Erasmus to\n> improve your living conditions. He will see that you receive better\n> rations every day.\" She turned to look at the robot, narrowing her\n> eyes. \"Isn't that correct?\"\n>\n> The robot gave her a placid, comfortable smile as if content--- not at\n> what he had done, but at the interesting things he had observed. \"As\n> you wish, Serena Butler.\"\n>\n> *Owing to the seductive nature of machines, we assume that\n> technological advances are always improvements and always beneficial\n> to humans.*\n\n--- PRIMERO FAYKAN BUTLER,\n\n*Memoirs of the Jihad*\n\n> **A**fter blaming the failure of his alloy resonator on incompetent\n> solvers, Tio Holtzman abandoned the project without further personal\n> embarrassment.

For once he wanted to accomplish\n> something entirely by himself, by rigid adherence to the calculational\n> results.\n>\n> But why had he brought Norma all the way from Rossak, if not to take\n> advantage of her skills? Annoyed at his own indecisiveness, Holtzman\n> returned the planetary projector to the clutter of a shelf. Time to\n> get back to work.\n>\n> A Dragoon guard marched through the doorway in a jangle of gold-scale\n> armor. He delivered a sheaf of calculation sheets from the solver\n> teams, the last round of simulation models.\n>\n> Holtzman studied the final numbers, skimming successive calculations.\n> He had worked and reworked his fundamental theory, and his solvers had\n> finally found the answers he needed. Excited, he slapped his palm on\n> the table, scattering piled documents. *Yes!*\n>\n> Pleased, the inventor organized his papers, neatly stacking notes,\n> sketches, and blueprint films. Then he spread out the calculation\n> sheets like a treasure display--- and summoned Norma Cenva. When she\n> came in, he proudly explained what he had done. \"Please--- I invite\n> you to study my results.\"\n>\n> \"I would be happy to, Savant Holtzman.\" Norma evinced no\n> competitiveness, no desire for fame. Holtzman was glad for all of\n> that. But\n>\n> he took a deep breath of trepidation.\n>\n> *I fear her.* He hated the thought, tried to set it aside.\n>\n> She climbed onto a stool, tapping her squarish chin as she pored over\n> the equations. Holtzman walked around his laboratory, flashing glances\n> over his shoulder, but she would not be distracted--- not even when he\n> disturbed a stack of resonating tone prisms.\n>\n> Norma absorbed the new concepts as if she were in a hypnotic trance.\n> He wasn't certain how her mental processes worked, only that they did.\n> Finally she emerged from her alternate world and set the papers aside.\n> \"It is indeed a new form of protective field, Savant. Your\n> manipulation of basic equations is innovative, and even I have\n> difficulty comprehending them in detail.\" She smiled at him, looking\n> very girlish, and he tried not to swell with relief and pride.\n>\n> Then, to his dismay, her tone changed. \"However, I'm not certain that\n> the application you intend will be valid.\"\n>\n> Her words fell like drops of hot lead on his skin. \"What do you mean?\n> The field can disrupt both computer gelcircuitry and physical\n> intrusion.\"\n>\n> Norma ran her fingers across a section of calculations on the third\n> page. \"Your major limiting factor is the radius of effective\n> projection, here and here. No matter how much energy you pump into the\n> shield generator, you cannot expand it beyond a certain constant\n> value. Such a field could protect ships and large buildings---\n> marvelously, in fact--- but it will never scale up to the diameter of\n> a planet.\"\n>\n> \"Can we use multiple small ones, then?\" Holtzman asked in an anxious\n> tone. \"Overlap them?\"\n>\n> \"Maybe,\" Norma agreed, though without enthusiasm. \"But the surprising\n> thing to me is *this*, the velocity variable.\" She circled another\n> part of an equation with her fingertip. \"If you rework the mathematics\n> here\"--- she took a calculation box, rapidly punched a scribe through\n> several openings to\n>\n> engage internal mechanisms, and slid narrow surface plates back and\n> forth ---\"the incident velocity becomes relevant when you separate it\n> as a function of the shield's effectiveness. Thus, at some minimum\n> value for the velocity, the protection factor becomes completely\n> insignificant.\"\n>\n> Holtzman stared, struggling to follow her argument. \"What do you\n> mean?\"\n>\n> Norma was incredibly patient with him. \"In other words, if a\n> projectile moves *slowly enough*, it can penetrate your shields. The\n> shield will stop a fast bullet, but anything slower than a certain\n> critical value passes through.\"\n>\n> \"What sort of enemy fires slow-moving bullets anyway?\" Holtzman said,\n> pulling the papers back toward him. \"Are you afraid someone will be\n> hurt by a tossed apple?\"\n>\n> \"I am simply explaining the ramifications of the mathematics, Savant.\"\n>\n> \"So my shields can protect only small areas, and only against fast\n> projectiles. Is that what you're saying?\"\n>\n> \"Not I, Savant Holtzman. That is what your own equations say.\"\n>\n> \"Well, there must be a practical application. I just wanted to show\n> you my work in progress. I'm sure you'll come up with something much\n> more earth-shattering on your own.\"\n>\n> Norma seemed not to notice his petulance. \"Might I have a copy of\n> this?\"\n>\n> Holtzman frowned at himself for being petty, even unproductive. \"Yes,\n> yes, I'll have the solvers make one for you, while I go into private\n> contemplation. I may be gone for several days.\"\n>\n> \"I'll remain here,\" Norma said, still staring at the mathematics, \"and\n> keep working.\"\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n> FLOATING ON THE river aboard a lavish traditional barge, Holtzman\n> paced the airy deck and mulled over possibilities. The water currents\n> stroking the sides of the barge brought a wet scent of metal and mud.\n>\n> In the covered aft section, a group of vacationers drank foaming wines\n> and sang songs, distracting him with their revelry as the driftbarge\n> cruised upriver. When one woman recognized the famous scientist, the\n> whole party invited him to join their table, which he did. After a\n> fine dinner, they shared expensive drinks and reasonably intelligent\n> conversation. He basked in the adulation.\n>\n> But in the middle of the night, unable to sleep, he resumed his work.\n>\n> Clinging to his past successes, remembering when the ideas had flowed\n> so easily, he refused to give up on the new concept. His innovative\n> shields had remarkable potential, but perhaps he was thinking in the\n> wrong paradigm. His canvas was large and his mission vague, but his\n> strokes had been too broad.\n>\n> Why must he worry about armoring an entire planet at a time? Was that\n> really necessary?\n>\n> There were other kinds of warfare: personal combat with ground troops,\n> hand-to-hand battles in which humans could free their captive brothers\n> on the Synchronized Worlds. Massive, planet-wrecking strikes wasted\n> lives. Since an artificial intelligence could copy itself\n> indefinitely, Omnius would never surrender, not even in the face of\n> overwhelming military resistance. The evermind would be nearly\n> impervious . . . unless commando teams could move directly into a\n> machine control center, as they had done on Giedi Prime.\n>\n> Now, as he paced the breezy deck of the river barge, stars glimmered\n> overhead. Holtzman gazed ahead into the sheer rock walls of the Isana\n> canyon, a deep gorge formed by the torrential river. He could hear a\n> whispering rumble of rapids approaching, but knew the barge would\n> steer through a safe channel along one side. He let his mind wander.\n>\n> Smaller shields . . . personal shields. Perhaps the invisible armor\n> would not stop slow projectiles, but they would be proof against most\n> military attacks. And the machines need never know the vulnerability.\n>\n> *Personal shields.*\n>\n> While the success and accolades might be less glorious, the new\n> defensive concept could still prove useful. In fact, it might save\n> billions of lives. People could wear the shields for personal\n> protection. Individuals, like tiny fortresses, could be made nearly\n> impervious to attack.\n>\n> Breathless, he returned to his luxurious cabin on the upper deck of\n> the barge, the interior of which was illuminated by one of Norma's\n> faceted glowglobes. Far into the night, he wrote and rewrote his\n> equations. Finally he studied his results with bleary, grainy eyes and\n> proudly labeled them the \"Holtzman Effect.\"\n>\n> *Yes, this will do nicely indeed.*\n>\n> He would summon a fast transport and return to Starda, downriver. He\n> couldn't wait to see the expression of bewilderment and awe on Norma's\n> face when she recognized his true genius, and realized that he had\n> never lost it.\n>\n> *It's not my problem.*\n>\n> --- saying of Ancient Earth\n>\n> **O**n the granite walls of the narrow river canyon, the slaves---\n> mostly boys like Ishmael and Aliid--- dangled in harnesses over the\n> empty abyss.

They had no place to go except down the\n> rock face to the frothing waters far below.\n>\n> The abrasive knife of the Isana had sliced a steep gorge, leaving\n> stone walls so flat and polished that no weed or bush could gain a\n> roothold. Though the river was fast and the waters treacherous, this\n> bottleneck was part of the vital trade route downriver. Floating\n> barges from the continental flatlands--- loaded with cargoes of grain,\n> fermented grass juices, flowers, and local spices--- passed through\n> the gorge.\n>\n> Lord Bludd had decided to put up a giant mosaic on a canyon wall, a\n> titanic mural to commemorate the triumphs of his noble family. The\n> northern end of the artwork began with idealized depictions of his\n> ancestor Sajak Bludd, while the southern expanse remained an immense\n> virgin slate for the accomplishments of future Poritrin lords.\n>\n> Ishmael, Aliid, and their companions were forced to build the mosaic.\n> A pattern had already been laser-etched onto the walls by artists, and\n> the boys methodically placed tiles over the design, each piece a tiny\n> pixel of what would ultimately become a colorful display. Scaffolds\n> hung down, laden with geometric tiles cut from fired river clay and\n> glazed with gem-based tints imported from Hagal.\n>\n> Seen from the decks of boats far below, the mural would be\n> breathtaking. But suspended in a harness up close, Ishmael could not\n> identify details. He saw only a blurry honeycomb of tiles, one color\n> after another laid down with foul-smelling epoxies.\n>\n> In a sling beside him, Aliid noisily trimmed tiles to fit into place.\n> Machine sounds ricocheted across the canyon: rock saws, pointed\n> hammers, power chisels. Lamenting his stolen life, Aliid sang a song\n> from IV Anbus as he worked. Ishmael joined in with a similar ballad\n> about Harmonthep.\n>\n> Hanging ten meters below in his own harness, a boy named Ebbin\n> composed an impromptu musical chant describing his home of Souci, a\n> habitable moon so isolated that neither Aliid nor Ishmael had heard of\n> it. The Tlulaxa slavers, it seemed, were adept at finding lost\n> Buddislamic refugees, persecuting Zensunnis and Zenshiites alike.\n>\n> On the long ropes and harnesses, boys proved more agile and energetic\n> than grown men or women. They could scramble over the granite to lay\n> down colored tiles while cool winds whistled through the canyon. The\n> overseers expected no trouble.\n>\n> They were wrong.\n>\n> With simmering resentment, Aliid often repeated the defiant words of\n> Bel Moulay. The fiery Zenshiite leader dreamed of a time when slaves\n> could throw off their chains and live free again, returning to IV\n> Anbus or Harmonthep or even mysterious Souci. Ishmael listened to the\n> foolish talk, but didn't want to add kindling to Aliid's fire.\n>\n> Remembering his compassionate grandfather, Ishmael remained a patient\n> pacifist. He realized that it might take longer than his own lifespan\n> before the slavers were overthrown. Aliid did not want to wait. He\n> felt the slaves deserved revenge, as dark-bearded Bel Moulay promised\n> in his impassioned speeches. . . .\n>\n> Across the canyon, the flamboyant Lord Bludd arrived at the viewing\n> platform with his noble entourage. The Lord's own concepts and\n> sketches had been adapted to the canyon wall by court artists, and he\n> made regular pilgrimages to inspect the work. Each week, the viewing\n> platform was moved down the canyon as the immense mosaic grid crawled\n> slowly along the granite cliffs. Flanked by golden Dragoon guards, the\n> nobleman congratulated the project masters.\n>\n> Currently, the mural showed how his great-grandfather, Favo Bludd, had\n> created unique artwork out in the great grassy plains, geometric\n> designs of flowers and weeds that bloomed in different seasons. When\n> seen from the air, these transient art pieces changed like\n> kaleidoscopic images. Each season the flowers grew in patterns, then\n> went to seed and gradually formed more random congregations as winds\n> disturbed the planter's palette.\n>\n> From where Bludd watched, surrounded by mumbling sycophants, the slave\n> boys looked like insects crawling along the opposite wall. He heard\n> their equipment noises and the faint, high tones of young voices.\n>\n> The work was progressing well. Giant figures, faces, and starships\n> covered the granite: an epic depiction of the settlement of Poritrin\n> and the intentional destruction of all computers, which returned the\n> planet to a bucolic existence, dependent upon slave labor.\n>\n> A man of great pride, Bludd knew the faces of his ancestors well.\n> Unfortunately, as he studied the interplay of light and color on the\n> unfinished mosaic, he found himself dissatisfied with the face of old\n> Favo. Though the mosaic pattern precisely followed the image that had\n> been laser-etched onto the granite, now that he saw the result larger\n> than life, Niko Bludd was not pleased. \"Look at the face of Lord Favo.\n> Do you agree that it is inaccurate?\"\n>\n> Everyone in his party concurred immediately. He called over the\n> project supervisor, explained the problem, and ordered removal of the\n> tiles on the face of Favo Bludd, pending a redesign of his features.\n>\n> The work boss hesitated for just a moment, then nodded.\n>\n> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>\n> DANGLING IN THEIR harnesses, Ishmael and Aliid let out simultaneous\n> groans as the outrageous instructions came down.

The hammer\n> fell, and he yelled, \"Look out below!\"\n>\n> Young Ebbin tried to scramble out of the way, his feet and arms\n> slipping as he moved across the polished rock. The hammer clipped him\n> on the shoulder, slicing the torso strap of his harness.\n>\n> Ebbin slipped, one-half of his support cut away, his collarbone\n> broken. He screamed and scrabbled, grabbing at the remaining harness\n> loop that dug into his right underarm. His feet slid on the polished\n> mosaic tiles.\n>\n> Ishmael tried to move sideways so that he could reach the taut cable\n> that held Ebbin. Aliid worked just as hard to drop down to where he\n> could support the boy from Souci.\n>\n> Ebbin kicked and thrashed. He dropped his own hammer, letting it fall\n> to the foamy ribbon of water far below. Ishmael grabbed the boy's\n> single remaining rope and held it, but didn't know what else to do.\n>\n> Above, slaves along the canyon rim began to haul on the cable, lifting\n> the struggling boy. But Ebbin's left arm hung limp, and with a broken\n> clavicle he could do little to help himself. The cable snagged on a\n> rock burr. Ishmael pulled the rope in an attempt to free it, his teeth\n> clenched. The boy was only a few feet beneath him now.\n>\n> Desperately, Ebbin reached up with one hand, clawing at the air.\n> Ishmael stretched downward, still grasping the cable but trying to\n> extend his free arm to meet the boy's grasp.\n>\n> Suddenly the workers on the canyon rim shouted in dismay. Ishmael\n> heard a snap as the rope broke far above.\n>\n> The line in his hand went limp, and Ishmael lurched wildly, grasping\n> at his harness. The fibrous cord that held Ebbin spun through his\n> clenched palm, burning skin. Ebbin reached up, in spite of his injury,\n> and his fingers barely missed Ishmael's. Then the boy dropped free,\n> his mouth open wide, his eyes bright and disbelieving. The frayed end\n> of the support cable popped through Ishmael's scorched hands as the\n> rope ran out.\n>\n> Ebbin tumbled toward the waiting Isana. The thin band of churning\n> water was so far below that Ishmael did not even see a splash as the\n> boy struck. . . .\n>\n> Aliid and Ishmael were dragged up to the top of the cliff, where the\n> project boss grudgingly tended their rope burns and other bruises.\n>\n> Ishmael felt sick, nearly vomited.

But the project leader showed no\n> sympathy and shouted down at the remaining youngsters, telling them to\n> get back to work.\n>\n> *Is there an upper limit to the intelligence of machines, and a lower\n> limit to the stupidity of humans?*\n>\n> --- BOVKO MANRESA,\n\nFirst Viceroy of the League of Nobles\n\n> **O**f all the annoyances committed by the vermin humans on Earth,\n> Ajax considered sedition the most unforgivable.\n>\n> The victim whimpered and wailed, struggling plaintively against his\n> bonds as the bully Titan paced back and forth, his sleek legs\n> clattering on the floor of the vast empty chamber. After catching the\n> crew boss at his attempted treachery, Ajax had clamped a free-formed\n> artificial hand around the man's right bicep and dragged him away from\n> his workers, screaming and stumbling.\n>\n> The slaves had stopped their tasks, looking with horror and pity at\n> their supervisor, now fallen to the wrath of Ajax.

Inside, the hall was an empty shell without facilities,\n> only a floor of plazcrete.\n>\n> Ajax and the traitor could be alone here for a lengthy private\n> interrogation. The very idea of a revolt among the slaves amused him\n> with its na\u00efve absurdity, especially the possibility that a trustee\n> would add his support to such nonsense.\n>\n> With a thoughtrode impulse, he focused his myriad optic threads on the\n> whimpering captive. The terrified man had soiled himself and sobbed\n> pathetically, making more excuses than denials. No need to hurry. Best\n> to play this out for his own enjoyment.\n>\n> \"You plotted to overthrow the rule of thinking machines.\" Ajax kept\n> his voice firm and deep. \"Concocting tales of a widespread underground\n> resistance, with the foolish aim of making slaves rise up and somehow\n> gain a fairytale independence from Omnius.\"\n>\n> \"It's not true!\" the man wailed. \"I swear I didn't know what I was\n> doing. I was following instructions. I received messages---\"\n>\n> \"You received messages commanding you to commit sedition, and did not\n> report them to me?\" Ajax's ominous laugh made the poor fellow wet\n> himself. \"Instead, you surreptitiously passed the word among your work\n> crews.\"\n>\n> The evidence of sedition was incontrovertible, and Ajax expected to be\n> rewarded for dealing with the problem. Omnius was watching, after all.\n> Perhaps, the cymek thought, if he ferreted out the core of this\n> budding rebellion, he could claim a reward, even demand the\n> opportunity to fight in a spectacular gladiatorial combat, as\n> Barbarossa and Agamemnon had done.\n>\n> \"We must record this properly.\" Ajax strode forward on flexible\n> armored legs, swaying sets of exaggerated insectlike arms. He grabbed\n> the captive's left wrist and clamped down with a polymer-metal grasp.\n> \"Tell us your name.\"\n>\n> The trustee blubbered and pleaded, trying to flinch away. In a twinge\n> of anger, Ajax clenched his powerful gripper and snipped off the\n> sobbing captive's hand at the wrist. The man screamed, and blood\n> spurted, much of it raining onto the cymek's front set of optic\n> threads. Ajax cursed to himself. He had not meant to inflict so much\n> pain before the human even had the chance to answer simple questions.\n>\n> While the crew boss howled and thrashed, Ajax activated a hot blue\n> flamer and scorched the end of the severed wrist, crisping the stump.\n> \"There, it's cauterized.\" Ajax waited for the man to show some hint of\n> gratitude. \"Now answer the question. What is your name?\"\n>\n> Shaping another menacing claw from his flowing metal limb-tip, Ajax\n> grasped the man's other hand. The crew boss wailed unrelentingly, but\n> had the presence of mind to say, \"*Ohan*. Ohan Freer! That's my name.\n> Please, don't hurt me again.\"\n>\n> \"A good start.\" Ajax knew, though, that the hurting had just begun. He\n> especially enjoyed this part of his job, when he could improvise pain\n> and inflict it like a master designer.\n>\n> Some of the other Titans considered Ajax a loose cannon. But if a\n> leader couldn't show a little domination over a vanquished people,\n> what was the point of taking over the Old Empire in the first place?\n> Even in their glory days, Ajax had never been interested, like Xerxes,\n> in extravagant food and drink, or in a pampered lifestyle with toys\n> and pleasures like his own spoiled mate, Hecate.\n>\n> No, Ajax had joined the team for the sheer challenge of it. Early on,\n> when Tlaloc had made plans with his fellow conspirators, seductive\n> Juno had recruited Ajax to their cause. A tough and aggressive\n> fighter, Ajax had provided the muscle the Titans needed--- not just\n> physical strength, but the mindset of a warrior, a relentless\n> conqueror.

That way, restless slaves on other Titan-controlled worlds\n> could experience the punishment vicariously.\n>\n> Then he set to work.\n>\n> The essential job had taken years, but Ajax finally succeeded in\n> exterminating every living human on Walgis--- committing most of the\n> murder with atomics, poison gas clouds, and customized diseases. To\n> finish off the survivors, Ajax had installed his brain canister inside\n> a monstrous and intimidating body and hunted the humans down like wild\n> animals. Accompanied by squads of Barbarossa's programmed robots, he\n> had burned cities, smashed buildings, ferreted out any human presence.\n> He killed every last one of the *hrethgir*, and enjoyed it\n> immeasurably.\n>\n> Truly, those had been the glory days of the Titans!\n>\n> The violence, however justified, had troubled his mate Hecate, the\n> weakest and most squeamish of the original twenty. Although she had\n> joined Tlaloc's rebellion to earn rewards for herself, she'd never\n> understood the necessities of the job and had gradually wilted from\n> it. After the Titans had sacrificed their human bodies in favor of an\n> immortal existence as cymeks, Hecate had remained with Ajax, all the\n> while trying unsuccessfully to change his personality. Despite their\n> disagreements, Ajax had been fond of her, though his need for a lover\n> had vanished with his physical form.\n>\n> Appalled at Ajax's bloodthirsty response to the Hrethgir Rebellions,\n> Hecate had \"resigned\" her position among the Titans. She wanted\n> nothing more to do with ruling humanity. Encased in a cymek body of\n> her own design, a long-range space vessel, Hecate simply departed,\n> leaving the remaining Titans to continue their death grip on humanity.\n>\n> Ironically, Hecate had chosen the perfect time to leave. Not long\n> after the obliteration of humans on Walgis, Xerxes's fatal error had\n> allowed the Omnius evermind to get loose. . . .\n>\n> Now, inside the blood-spattered Hall of Justice, Ajax raised his\n> intimidating body high.

Ajax was about to pronounce\n> sentence\n>\n> --- execution, no doubt--- upon a man he had taken captive, a crew\n> boss from another labor gang, Ohan Freer.\n>\n> Iblis had trained with the accused trustee in the special schools, but\n> he had never seen his fellow crew boss do anything illegal. Ajax\n> rarely needed much of an excuse, however. He himself had experienced\n> the Titan's displeasure more than once, but so far had managed to\n> survive. He doubted his compatriot would fare as well today.\n>\n> An ornate metal-worked column stood in the center of the square. A\n> roaring orange flame gushed from the top of the pillar, like an\n> ornamental smokestack. Fanciful facades of immense buildings, all\n> empty, surrounded the plaza like prison walls around a central\n> courtyard. Omnius's sentinel robots looked powerful and portentous in\n> formations along the sides of the square, ready to strike against any\n> perceived infraction by the expendable human slaves.\n>\n> Iblis guided his crew into the partitioned viewing areas, voicing a\n> few words of reassurance, though not enough to upset the cymeks. Ajax\n> loved showmanship, wanted to make certain every terrified eye\n> witnessed his actions. When Iblis and the other crew bosses blew\n> whistles to signal their readiness, Ajax emerged, carrying his maimed\n> prisoner.\n>\n> The Titan wore an antlike body with an impressive ellipsoidal core,\n> heavy walking legs, and four grasping arms in which he held Ohan\n> Freer.\n>\n> Hovering watcheyes captured images and fed a steady stream of data to\n> the evermind.\n>\n> Beneath the flaming pillar, Ajax clutched the squirming victim like a\n> giant ant soldier with a hapless enemy beetle. Doomed Ohan had been\n> burned, bloodied, and wounded; his left hand was only a charred stump.\n> Blossoming bruises discolored his skin. A thin, watery wail leaked\n> from his mouth.\n>\n> A mutter of dismay came from the human onlookers. Watching them, Iblis\n> knew these workers could not have been the source of the rebellion,\n> despite the mysterious and provocative messages he had received. What\n> if he was deluding himself and the secret call to freedom was simply a\n> wishful suggestion voiced by another desperate person?\n>\n> Lifting the unfortunate captive high, Ajax amplified his vocal\n> synthesizers so that his words boomed like a projectile cannon around\n> the enclosed square. \"Some of you have heard this criminal speak. Some\n> of you may have had the poor judgment to listen to his silly\n> imaginings about freedom and rebellion. You would be wiser to cut off\n> your ears than listen to such foolishness.\"\n>\n> The crowd held its collective breath. Iblis bit his lower lip, not\n> wanting to watch, but fixated on the imminent horror. If he averted\n> his gaze, the watcheyes might well detect it, and he would hear about\n> it later. As a consequence, Iblis stared at every unfolding second.\n>\n> \"This poor, deluded man is no longer necessary to the continued glory\n> of Omnius in the reign of the thinking machines.\"\n>\n> Ohan screamed, and struggled weakly. Ajax held the man's intact arm in\n> one roughly formed pincer claw and each leg in two others. With his\n> last claw, Ajax wrapped a long, sharp embrace around Ohan's chest,\n> under his armpits.\n>\n> \"He is no longer a worker. He is no longer even *hrethgir*, one of the\n> unruly humans who survive at our own sufferance. He is *garbage*.\"\n> Ajax paused.\n>\n> \"And garbage is to be discarded.\"\n>\n> Then, without a sound or any sign of effort, Ajax pulled his\n> artificial limbs in different directions, tearing the helpless Ohan\n> asunder. The man's arms and legs ripped free, his chest tore open and\n> broken bones pierced skin. Blood and entrails spilled onto the clean\n> flagstones of the Golden Age Square.\n>\n> Ajax flung the bloody parts into the screaming crowd. \"Enough of this\n> nonsense! There is no rebellion. Now get back to work.\"\n>\n> The sickened workers seemed only too eager to race back to their\n> tasks, looking to Iblis as they left, as if he could protect them. But\n> Iblis still stared in disbelieving amazement. Ohan Freer had been a\n> member of the rebellion! The crew boss had spread dissent, made plans,\n> perhaps sent and received messages.\n>\n> *Another rebel!*\n>\n> Appalled, Iblis knew the danger to himself was even greater now, if he\n> continued to act. Nonetheless, today's execution had shown him one\n> thing more clearly than ever: The brewing human rebellion was not just\n> his imagination.\n>\n> *It is real!*\n>\n> If Ohan had been part of it, then there must be others, too--- many of\n> them. This underground network of fighters, which included Iblis, was\n> safely separated into cells so that no one could betray the others.\n> Now he understood.\n>\n> He began to make plans with even greater conviction than before.\n>\n> *Humans deny a continuum of possibilities, an infinite number of\n> realms into which their species may enter.*\n>\n> --- ERASMUS,\n\nnotes on human nature\n\n> **I**t was a makeshift performance hall, inside a marble-walled\n> building on the robot's estate. Erasmus had worked his slave crews to\n> modify the interior, install seats, and retool the walls, all to\n> create perfect acoustics for this single performance. Erasmus had\n> studied records of the greatest human classical music, knew exactly\n> what was expected of grand symphonies, from the audience to the\n> setting. He had high standards for his artistic endeavors.\n>\n> The robot invited Serena Butler, now in her eighth month of pregnancy,\n> to sit in a large central chair for the concert. \"These other people\n> might experience pleasure from the melody and the sounds, but you have\n> different expectations. On Salusa Secundus, sophisticated music was a\n> part of your existence.\"\n>\n> With a pang, Serena thought of her brother and his musical\n> aspirations. She had learned to appreciate the enduring works of\n> long-vanished human composers. \"Music is not the only thing I miss,\n> Erasmus.\"\n>\n> \"You and I speak the same cultured language,\" he said, not noticing\n> her pointed remark. \"You will tell me how you enjoy this composition.\n> I had you in mind when I wrote it.\"\n>\n> He filled the performance hall with worker-caste slaves culled from a\n> variety of skilled labor assignments. They were cleaned up and dressed\n> according to Erasmus's concept of a high-class audience.\n>\n> Electronic portraits of great human composers lined the interior\n> walls, as if the robot wanted to count himself among their number.\n> Around the perimeter of the concert hall, museum-type display cases\n> held musical\n>\n> instruments--- a lute, a rebec, a gilded tambour, and an antique\n> fifteen-string baliset with inlaid vabalone shells on its case.\n>\n> In the center of the mezzanine stage beneath open rafters, Erasmus sat\n> alone before a grand piano, surrounded by music synthesizers,\n> speakers, and a sound-misting station. Wearing a formal black suit\n> with a cut similar to a tuxedo but redesigned to accommodate his\n> robotic body, Erasmus sat at attention, his face a smooth mirrored\n> oval, showing no expression.\n>\n> Shifting to find a more comfortable position for her back, Serena\n> watched the inquisitor robot. She rested a hand on her enormous\n> abdomen, felt the movements of the restless baby. Within weeks, she\n> would deliver her child.\n>\n> Around her, the captive audience shifted uneasily, not sure what to\n> expect, or what was expected of them. Erasmus turned his mirrored face\n> toward the audience, reflecting them as he waited, and waited. Finally\n> silence fell.\n>\n> \"Thank you for your attention.\" He turned to a shiny silver apparatus\n> beside him, a music synthesizer with dancing polymer fingertips that\n> produced familiar riffs and chords. The background music increased in\n> volume, laced with stringed instruments and mournful Chusuk horns.\n>\n> The robot listened for several moments, then continued, \"You are about\n> to experience something truly remarkable. To demonstrate my respect\n> for the creative spirit, I have composed a new symphony especially for\n> you, my hardworking slaves. No human has ever heard it before.\"\n>\n> He played a rapid mixture of melodies on the piano, running through\n> three short passages in an apparent effort to confirm that the\n> instrument was tuned properly. \"After detailed analysis of the field,\n> I have written a symphony comparable to the works of the great human\n> composers Johannes Brahms and Emi Chusuk. I developed my piece\n> according to strict principles of order and mathematics.\"\n>\n> Serena perused the audience, doubting any of the humans raised in\n> captivity were familiar with the classical music the robot had\n> mentioned. Schooled on Salusa Secundus, where music and art were\n> integral parts of the culture,\n>\n> Serena had listened to the renowned works of many composers, even\n> discussing them at length with Fredo.\n>\n> With a mental pulse Erasmus linked his gelcircuitry mind to the\n> synthesizer, producing a strange, repetitious melody. Then his\n> mechanical fingers danced over the keyboard, and he made frequent\n> sweeping gestures as he played, as if imitating a famous concert\n> pianist.\n>\n> Serena found the composition pleasant enough, but unremarkable. And,\n> although she did not recognize the precise melody, it had a strangely\n> familiar character, as if the robot had mathematically analyzed an\n> existing piece measure by measure and followed the pattern, changing a\n> rhythm here, a polyphonic passage there. The music felt lackluster,\n> with no powerful driving force.\n>\n> Erasmus apparently believed it was a human instinct to appreciate a\n> new work, that his captive audience would intrinsically note the\n> nuances and complexities of his structurally perfect composition. The\n> slaves around Serena shifted in their seats and listened; to them,\n> this was a pleasant enough diversion but just another work assignment.\n> The conscripted audience seemed to enjoy the soothing notes of the\n> melody, but it did not move them in the way the robot desired.\n>\n> When at last he ceased his performance, Erasmus sat back from the\n> piano, deactivated the symphonic support equipment, and let the\n> silence deepen. The reverberating tones faded.\n>\n> For a moment, the slaves hesitated as if waiting for instructions.\n> Erasmus said, \"You may give an ovation if you enjoyed the piece.\" They\n> didn't seem to understand the reference, until he said, \"Signify by\n> clapping your hands.\"\n>\n> An initial wave of applause came as a sparse patter like raindrops,\n> then swelled into louder clapping--- as was expected of them. Serena\n> joined in politely, though not enthusiastically. A small act of\n> honesty that she was sure Erasmus would notice.\n>\n> The robot's shining mask had shifted into a proud smile. In his formal\n> black garment he walked smoothly down a staircase from the mezzanine\n> stage to the main floor. The slaves continued to applaud, and he\n> basked in the apparent adulation. When the acclamation receded, he\n> summoned sentinel guards to escort the audience back to their regular\n> work assignments.\n>\n> Serena could see that Erasmus believed he had created an enduring work\n> of merit that possibly surpassed what humans had achieved. But she\n> didn't want to discuss it with him, and tried to slip away to her\n> greenhouse work. She moved slowly because of her pregnancy, however,\n> and Erasmus caught up with her. \"Serena Butler, I wrote this symphony\n> for your benefit. Are you not impressed by it?\"\n>\n> She selected her words carefully, avoiding a candid answer. \"Perhaps I\n> am simply sad because your symphony reminds me of other performances I\n> watched on Salusa Secundus. My late brother wanted to be a musician.\n> Those were happier times for me.\"\n>\n> He looked at her closely, his optic threads sparkling. \"Nuances of\n> human behavior tell me that my symphony has disappointed you. Explain\n> why.\"\n>\n> \"You don't want an honest opinion.\"\n>\n> \"You misjudge me, for I am a seeker of truth. Anything else is faulty\n> data.\" His cherubic expression caused her to lower her guard. \"Is\n> there something wrong with the acoustics in this hall?\"\n>\n> \"It's nothing to do with the acoustics. I'm sure you tested everything\n> to technical perfection.\" The audience continued to move toward the\n> exits, some looking over their shoulders at Serena with pity that the\n> robot had taken a special interest in her. \"It was the symphony\n> itself.\"\n>\n> \"Continue,\" Erasmus said. His voice was flat.\n>\n> \"You assembled that piece, you didn't *create* it. It was based on\n> precise models developed ages ago by human composers. The only\n> creativity I heard came from their minds, not yours. Your music was a\n> mathematical\n>\n> extrapolation, but nothing that inspired me in any way. The tune you .\n> . .*engineered* evoked no images or feelings within me. There was no\n> fresh element that you contributed, nothing emotionally compelling.\"\n>\n> \"How am I to quantify such an ingredient?\"\n>\n> Forcing a smile, Serena shook her head. \"Therein lies your mistake,\n> Erasmus. It is impossible to quantify creativity. How does a person\n> hear a thunderstorm and use that experience to write the 'William Tell\n> Overture'? You would simply imitate the sounds of thunder and rain,\n> Erasmus, but you wouldn't *evoke the impression* of a storm. How did\n> Beethoven look at a peaceful meadow and adapt that experience into his\n> 'Pastorale'? Music should make the spirit soar, take the breath away,\n> touch the soul. Your work was just . . . pleasant tones, adequately\n> performed.\"\n>\n> The robot took several seconds to change the expression on his face,\n> and finally looked at her with perplexity, even defensiveness. \"Your\n> opinion seems to be in the minority. The rest of the audience greatly\n> appreciated the work. Did you not notice their applause?\"\n>\n> She sighed. \"First of all, those slaves have no knowledge of music, no\n> basis of comparison. You could have stolen any symphony from a\n> classical composer, note for note, and called it your own. They\n> wouldn't have known the difference.\n>\n> \"Second, sitting in a concert hall--- comfortable, clean, and\n> well-dressed--- is probably the best work assignment you've ever given\n> them. Why wouldn't they clap for that reason alone?\"\n>\n> She looked at him. \"Finally, and most important, you *told* them to\n> applaud. How are they supposed to react, when they know you could have\n> them killed at any moment? Under such circumstances, Erasmus, you will\n> never get a fair and honest response.\"\n>\n> \"I do not understand, cannot understand.\" Erasmus repeated this\n> several times. Abruptly, he whirled and swung a hardened fist into the\n> face of a\n>\n> man who walked past. The unexpected blow sent the victim crashing over\n> the chairs, bleeding.\n>\n> \"Why did you do that?\" Serena demanded, rushing over to help the man.\n>\n> \"Artistic temperament,\" Erasmus said calmly. \"Is that not what humans\n> call it? He tried to deceive me about how he really felt.\"\n>\n> She tried to soothe the man, but when he looked up to see the robot,\n> the slave struggled away, holding a hand up to stop the blood dripping\n> from his nose. Serena rounded on Erasmus. \"True artists are sensitive\n> and compassionate. They don't need to *hurt* people to make them\n> feel.\"\n>\n> \"You are not afraid to voice your opinion, even when you believe it\n> might displease me?\"\n>\n> Serena looked directly into his unnatural face. \"You hold me prisoner,\n> Erasmus. You claim to want my opinion, so I give it. You can hurt me,\n> even murder me, but you have already taken me away from my life and\n> the man I love. Any further pain pales in comparison.\"\n>\n> Erasmus stared at her, assessing what she had said. \"Humans are\n> perplexing to me--- and you more than anyone, Serena Butler.\" His\n> flowmetal countenance took on a smiling expression. \"But I will keep\n> trying to understand. Thank you for your insights.\"\n>\n> As Serena left the hall, Erasmus returned to the piano and began\n> practicing.\n>\n> *Above all, I am a man of honor. This is how I wish to be remembered.*\n\n--- XAVIER HARKONNEN,\n\ncomment to his men\n"}
